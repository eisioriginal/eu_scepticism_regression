Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, José Manuel, I do not know if I should make a speech: I fully support yours! I do not need to repeat it but I will just echo a few comments that you made and look at them in more detail, although I feel that you covered everything. The only thing that has not been said is that with EUR 1.1 billion or EUR 1.13 billion, the budget that we have today, we can continue our policies; but below EUR 1 billion, we cannot do anything. I think that the Commission and Parliament have to stand firm in relation to what is happening now in the Council. As you said, on the one hand, there are those who want a long-term budget that can meet the challenges ahead: because the European budget is an investment budget and not a budget of expenditure; because we need it to relaunch growth and job creation and, in my opinion, no Head of State or Government is opposed to that. Then there are those who want a reduced budget to make short-term savings. In these conditions, do we really need a summit this afternoon? We need to meet to discuss, but not to reduce, the budget. The European Parliament’s position is clear, however; this position is now that of the majority in Europe and 517 Members of this Parliament voted for a multiannual financial framework (MFF) that is realistic and meets our ambitions. Sixteen Heads of Government are following this line and they met last week, as you said. If I were to give them one piece of advice, I would say: ‘be united at the Council and stand firm when it comes to defending our common budget’. At the risk of repeating myself, those who see only a free trade area and a single market in Europe are lying to themselves and they are lying to their citizens. The European Union is, above all, a Community of values, including that of solidarity. Did you know that, through the European Stability Mechanism, the Estonians and the Slovakians are helping to fund pensions in Greece, which are even higher than their own? I wanted to highlight this – and it is not said often enough – because these countries believe in the added value of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, my group is convinced that the European Union needs a sound, solid, responsible budget because, with the crisis, it is the only way for certain Member States to make investments. In the Baltic countries, for example, a Prime Minister told me last week that without funding from Europe, railway lines will continue to be connected to Moscow, and not to Europe. That is not what European integration means. However, like us, the Baltic countries need these connections to Europe. To achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we will need more than a trillion euros worth of investment in infrastructure networks. Yes, most of these investments will be private, but without European support, without cofinancing on our part, these projects will not see the light of day because of a lack of start-up capital. Let us take another example: we decided to invest nearly EUR 270 billion so that all European households and all our businesses benefit from broadband between now and 2020. However, if we had waited for private investment alone to achieve this, we would only have reached EUR 50 billion. That would mean no broadband for Europe as we would be EUR 220 billion short. These investments are necessary for our businesses, however. They create jobs, they stimulate the economy, and they contribute to our competitiveness. The only way to get out of this economic crisis is to develop through investment. Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. Either we learn the lessons of these last 60 years and we work together to relaunch Europe around peace, solidarity and competitiveness, or we trap ourselves in selfish, nationalist positions and founder together.  The 16 Member States plus Croatia who met last week in the European Parliament demonstrated that there is a core of Member States who want to move forward together. We, in the European Parliament, are going to defend our position on the budget. We will defend the European aid programme for the poor, which you mentioned. The proposal to reduce this programme by EUR 400 million is unacceptable. We will not allow this programme to be touched, even if we have to make an effort on all the other budget lines. It is out of the question to sacrifice aid to our poorest citizens, especially since their number will grow with the crisis. We have to fulfil this responsibility in order to support the NGOs that look after these people voluntarily. Removing this funding from the budget is not really a sign of solidarity; it is exactly the opposite. I am counting on this Parliament: we must not allow this position to be attacked. We will defend the Europe in which we believe: not a sum of countries that pick and choose from the menu of common policies, but a real union of 27 that is united, responsible and prosperous. We are at a crossroads. It is our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand firm if things do not move in the right direction, and it is also our duty to go beyond the selfish, national positions in our various countries to pave the way for the Europe of the future.

Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am, by nature, an optimistic person. My optimism is realistic, however. It is based on concrete elements, on facts and accomplishments, and on experience of everything we have achieved in the past 60 years, which, in the end, is just a start. The Nobel Prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of what we have built together over 60 years. However, it is also encouragement to go further, and I believe in Europe. I believe in the Community method. I believe in the added value that the European Union offers through its common policies. I also believe, however, in the European investment that allows our budget to inject some EUR 100 billion into our economies every year, and it is by no means enough. Europe needs these ambitious policies, policies that are going to help us to restore growth, but to implement them, we need an ambitious budget. I think that the debate here has clearly demonstrated that. I therefore appeal to everyone to face up to their responsibilities. We need a financial framework that matches our ambitions and, above all, we need an agreement at the end of the year if we want to appear credible to the outside world, Mr President. Last week’s European Council took a further step towards achieving our economic union. Our crisis is an economic crisis, but our mistake has been to fail to meet our commitments and comply with the rules that we set ourselves. In recent months, we have faced up to our responsibilities here, in this Parliament, and we have introduced the necessary instruments. The ‘economic governance’ package now has force of law but it has to be applied. The same goes for the ‘two-pack’ that we are discussing today. I think that we are going to conclude that very soon. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the lessons of this crisis is that we cannot exclude certain sectors, such as the banking sector, from our common laws. My group is aware of that, which is why we support the Council’s proposal to establish a European bank supervisor. In our economy, everything is connected. The slightest failure, the collapse of a single bank, affects the entire system. The banks may think that they are too big to fail, but no bank is too small to be supervised. We are convinced of this: our citizens, our businesses and the banks themselves need to have confidence in our financial system. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will make every effort to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from this crisis and that our European Union is reinforced because we believe that Europe is the solution. For some 20 years, the single market has been our success, but for that success to last, we must complete it and finish our work. We must force the Heads of State or Government to quickly fill in the gaps in the single market. I am thinking, in particular, about the establishment of the digital single market. If we do not do this, we will lose a turnover of EUR 1 billion every year. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroads. Some people want to do away with some of the European Union’s competences and reduce Europe to an economic free trade area. Europe is much more than that, however. Since the signature of the Treaty of Rome by our founding fathers, the European project has been synonymous with peace and prosperity. That has now been rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize. For 60 years, Europe has set an example in the world. Our role tomorrow is to strengthen the social market economy, increase our solidarity, continue to defend human rights and, above all, spread our values throughout Europe and beyond. President-in-Office of the Council, as I have said often here in this House, in times of crisis we need to take decisions. When we take decisions, it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes, but the worst thing to do in a crisis is to wait for too long. If we wait for too long, we will eventually cost our fellow citizens billions of euros. That is my appeal to you, and I hope that we will see a very good European budget before the end of the year. That will be proof of our commitment for the outside world and the markets. I wish you the very best of luck; I hope that you have the determination to reach your goal and bring us a nice Christmas present at our December part-session. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank José Manuel Barroso for his address, his speech, his analysis and his realism. We are back after summer break and, as is the case each year, we have two things to do: take stock of the past twelve months and discuss the future of the European Union. I think we are heading in the right direction now. What I mean is that we need to continue along the road towards greater European integration We also need more specific reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking about the crisis for three years now. We know that we were living beyond our means for too long, we know that we need greater discipline and a return to balanced budgets. Only then will we be able to invest in our future generations. We know the ways out of the crisis. In economic terms, what we have done over the last three years, we have done too slowly, and that has cost us billions. As for the economic governance package, the Euro Plus Pact, the European Semester, the Single Market Act, and in some sectors, for example, the banks, the need for European solutions is evident. Banks are no longer national, but transnational. A failing bank can bring down the entire banking system. This is why my group supports your proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism in the banking sector. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that our solutions are positive and we have examples to back this up. Although, I have not written it down on my sheet here, you have made me realise that there are also some positive examples. I think that the governments that have made the most reforms in Europe also belong to our political family. I am thinking about our friend Mr Dombrovskis. Although his is a small country deep in crisis, he got it out of crisis and there is now meaningful growth. Here too, as I see it, is an example, and he did it without having to rely too much on European solidarity. In his speeches, he stressed that in this deep crisis the only money he had to invest, was money he received from the EU budget. I think this needs to be given some thought because, unlike some, we realised how serious the situation was. We know that our economies are in bad shape and that the only way to get them better is a complete cure. To kick start this, we need a change of habits. We need large-scale rather than small-scale reforms. Yes, it is hard, but what choice do we have? For these reforms to succeed, we must also promote competitiveness and growth. My group supports those governments that are going down this route. I would also like to make another point. European solidarity should not be confused with charity. That is why I support the European Central Bank’s proposal to buy bonds because any State that benefits from this solidarity must act responsibly. Without a programme of reforms offering credible proposals, a State cannot receive this aid. This is the right approach. It is a European approach and, by bolstering States in difficulty, it is Europe, as a whole, that we are strengthening. Ladies and gentlemen, I will say it again, 20 years after it was introduced, we have still not completed the single market. Mr Barroso, I am appealing to you again. We must, as a matter of urgency, develop an action plan with precise deadlines to finish the job we started. The rules on the single market should be simple, consistently applied and implemented as a single package. For example, because of red tape, 23 million European SMEs still have no access to all 27 markets. Let me tell you that one job created in each of these 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises – if you tot it up - is a significant number. That is why my group has called for a reduction in red tape by 2015. At least 50% less paper: think of the trees saved for the environment. By doing this, we are giving European companies the chance to create jobs. The Commission must play a full part and have no hesitation in enforcing the law. Publish lists of States that have still not implemented the directives and force them to do so. Use your powers! Governments are frequently challenging us Europeans. Everything is always our fault. Let them, then, take some responsibility too. I call on you, Mr President, to define new, concrete fields in which the European institutions should intervene. I am convinced that there is a very simple remedy for the current crisis: it is more Europe, yet more Europe and more Europe again. What we need is fiscal and social harmonisation. Our joint actions and policies are successful. Let me give you one example that will surely surprise you: agricultural policy. This truly is a joint policy which has ensured food security – as you mentioned – during periods of significant fluctuations. It has also got entire regions out of poverty. This policy must remain European. Above all, we must not do what many are now calling for and renationalise it. That would be a disaster. This is a European policy that been successful and must remain European. To take another example, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment. No country can solve this problem on its own. Even if this comes under national jurisdiction, again, it is time to find a European solution. Again, I am thinking about this extra job in each of the 23 million SMEs. It might make you all smile, but not me: twenty-three million extra jobs with a European policy for youth employment; that should make you think. Ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Mr President, we are in the throes of an unprecedented storm. There are those in Europe and elsewhere, who would be only too pleased to see the euro collapse. Personally, I do not want to give them that pleasure and nor do you, José Manuel. Besides, why do the credit rating agencies prefer to attack the euro, rather than judge the country they know best where their head office is? They are not making the same analyses. I know why but, all the same, it is not right. We must face this storm, not by plastering up the cracks, but by strengthening our foundations. We must not repeat past mistakes. Creating an economic union without an accompanying political union is inconceivable. Our credibility is at stake. Mr President, let us show some European ambition. Europe makes decisions that affect 500 million Europeans. These decisions should be taken under democratic control, by the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage. The place of democratic legitimacy is here in Parliament, and I thank President Schulz for having refocused matters. We are elected democratically. I therefore think we should be recognised democratically. The so-called ‘four presidents’’ proposal aiming at real economic and monetary union is ambitious but it needs to be more so and Parliament should also be involved in this. Concentrating only on economic reforms is the wrong way to go because the economic crisis has become a political crisis, a crisis of confidence – as you rightly pointed out at the end. Now, I agree on a Treaty change in the medium and long term, but this is not the solution we need in the immediate future. Because I am French, all we need is for some Rules of Procedure to be applied to fiscal and social policies, and to be included in the Treaty when we have time to think. Now is the time for action. The latest Eurobarometer struck me. It reveals that a majority of Europeans think that Europe is indeed a good thing. But in many Member States, more and more of our citizens do not feel European. It is our duty - as you said - to explain the added value, but it is also the duty of all national leaders. For me, a good, responsible politician is like a good doctor. Both have to explain things, both have to tell the truth, both have to convince you, even if you do not want to hear it. We need to discuss the next steps of our integration with this reality in mind. Ladies and gentlemen, I am calling for more Europe, not more power for the sake of having power. We must build a Europe that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. This is why we want the 2014-2020 EU budget to have a credible, solid and ambitious framework, as it has been prepared by the Commission and Parliament. Here too, the Heads of State or Government are being held to political account and it will show our citizens whether or not we want more Europe. The European budget is not a budget of spending, but a budget of investing. It is a forward-looking budget, a budget for growth. Let us be serious and ambitious. I call on all those responsible to find a solution before the end of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, judges will today rule on the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Here in Parliament, we champion democratic control at European level. We also need to have the courage to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg when we think that our rights are not being respected. We must go before the Court frequently, as others do, and I am sure that will also strengthen Parliament. This is also why we need a real political Europe. A Europe where Parliament is the only direct representative of the citizens of Europe. If we do not do this, we will fail. Political union is legitimacy, it is more democratic control, more citizen participation. This is the Europe that I believe in. These are the values that our group supports. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Cyprus is taking over the Council presidency at a decisive moment for Europe. I said here, only yesterday in fact, that the European Council has held 30 meetings on the economic crisis and it is not over yet. Thirty meetings and only last week did we see the start of an action plan. That is why I am calling this morning on the new Presidency to show courage and determination. I hope that this Presidency will convince its 26 partners to opt for an integrated Europe, a political Europe and, at last, a united and therefore sovereign Europe. The economic crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge relates to the competitiveness of our economy and to unemployment, which is breaking records with an average rate of 11%. The opportunity is to do what the countries in the euro area should have done at the outset, in other words implement a common economic policy, a policy of balanced budgets and, above all, a long-term investment policy. President Christofias, although you and I are from radically opposed political parties, my group supports the priorities of your Presidency. In particular, I heard you use an expression that is very important to me: the Community method. In that respect, I know that I can count on you. Like you, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants the European Union to be more effective, more relevant and more efficient and to experience renewed growth. On that basis, we need to act. We need to take advantage of the 20th anniversary of the single market in the autumn to complete, at last, the work that began under Jacques Delors and implement the Single Market Act as quickly as possible. We need to apply the Services Directive in full. We need to create a genuine digital single market. We also need to reduce the burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. All of these measures will create growth and will thus create jobs. These are the measures that I am asking you, Mr President, to take along with this Parliament and in close cooperation with the Commission. There is another key aspect of your Presidency: the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. My group truly hopes that progress is made in this regard during the next six months, in the knowledge that the European budget is an investment budget, a growth budget and an employment budget. We need investment in all 27 Member States in infrastructure, investment in all 27 Member States in energy networks and in education, research and innovation, cohesion policies and food security; you spoke about food aid for the most deprived, I believe, and you also have my support in that regard. That is a credible and tangible response to the crisis, too. The Cypriot Presidency will find in the European Parliament an active and committed participant when it comes to the financial perspective, as long as the proposed budget is large enough and tailored to our needs. We will be keeping an eye on that, but we will help you to reach the end of the year with a Christmas package for this budget for the multiannual financial framework. Now, Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen – do not laugh, Mr Barroso, the package will be good, you will see – I would like to talk about another issue before you here this morning and that is the worrying political situation that has prevailed for a number of days in one of our Member States, Romania. Yesterday the Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, expressed grave concern. I quote: ‘I am seriously concerned about recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania. For me, a well-functioning, independent judicial system is a precondition for mutual trust in the European area of justice’. My group shares the Commission’s concerns and last week I, myself, expressed my concerns about the current state of democracy in Romania. This morning, I ask the Commission very sincerely to continue to monitor this issue as it has monitored others, in spite of the summer break. It is important for us to make progress over the next six months on various issues that are on the table and, President Christofias, we are counting on you. There are a lot of good things that you can do. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the thirtieth European Council dedicated to the crisis. Although, in comparison to previous meetings, we are closer to reaching the desired solution, the road map towards European political integration is still not forthcoming. Of course, this time, substantial progress has been achieved. Following the country-specific economic recommendations proposed by the Commission, the document presented by Mr Van Rompuy is a step in the right direction, as it finally refers to political Europe as the ultimate aim. He mentions a preparation period spread over 10 years. Yet, each of us knows that Europe will not survive between now and 2022 without budgetary, fiscal and social integration. I often wonder what political development the Twenty-Seven will judge sufficiently serious in order to consent to shared sovereignty. I wonder what graver problems are necessary, other than unemployment, the difficulties experienced by our companies, the prohibitive interest rates that our Member States must pay, in order to prove that a single currency must include a common economic policy. Having said that, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is satisfied with the advances contained in the Growth and Employment Pact, even though this contains some of the long-standing proposals already put forward by this Parliament and the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you must continue, together with Parliament, to put whatever is needed on the table, because when the Heads of State or Government come together, they are unable to find a solution. For each of them, it is a question of survival in their own countries. Therefore, we need Parliament, together with the Commission and Mr Van Rompuy, to come forward with, and put on the table, concrete proposals so that when governments find themselves strangled by the markets and suchlike, they may have a solution, as was the case with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’. My group supports the system of banking supervision, the proposal for a European guarantee and the European banking union project. Our fellow citizens must know that their savings are protected at all levels and that the instruments used to guarantee them are going in the right direction. Here too, we must strengthen protection. We need to guarantee the savings deposits of people who have worked all their lives, and you know we have problems with this issue at the moment. What now remains is the implementation of the instruments. That is why I again call upon the Commission, the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure this happens. The PPE Group also supports the EUR 10 billion increase in capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Indeed, we must ensure that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can finance their projects, keep their employees, in the first instance and, above all, be able to hire new staff. Although the provisions on the single market remain insufficient, project bonds, which were decided upon last Friday, are a step in the right direction. I welcome this move, insofar as it does not consist of supplementary funds that no longer exist, but rather better use of existing European funds. I would like to highlight here that last month, the Latvian Prime Minister once again came to speak to our group in order to tell us that, faced with the imperative of budgetary cuts that were being forced upon him, he has only been able to restart his country’s economy thanks to European funds. This is an example that must be repeated. The Latvian Prime Minister did it and he informed his citizens. Thanks to European solidarity, combined with the courage of its leaders, this country has restored growth and employment. Just because it is a small country does not mean that we cannot emulate this example. We do not talk enough about these amazing examples for Europe. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we see that the solution to the majority of our problems lies in having more Europe. It is for that reason that my group places so much importance on the next multiannual financial framework, which is presently under discussion, as it will allow us to continue to finance our common policies. These funds constitute the base of European solidarity and are an essential instrument for growth and employment. In the 1950s, European integration was necessary to guarantee peace and security in our continent. Today, this same integration is essential in order to protect our European social model which we have patiently constructed. It is essential in order to defend our common interests in international trade. It is essential for the promotion of our values and our humanist ideals, human rights, human dignity, transparency and the rule of law. That is why I repeat my call for a politically integrated Europe, not an intergovernmental Europe, as was supported by the Council in the Schengen case, or again last week concerning the issue of patents. For as long as the Community method is not our governance rule, nor that of the Council, Europe will lose ground. I know you have a difficult job, Mr Van Rompuy, but fear not! Make proposals with us, with Parliament and the Commission, to these Heads of State or Government who, as I said, do not have the capacity for reflection as they are obligated to manage their very difficult issues on a daily basis in each of their respective countries. We need a much more integrated Europe. We must compare what works, the countries that cope – because there are some – and apply their example to those that work less well. There you have what I want us to put on the table, Mr Barroso, during the next two months. We will reflect further on this during the holidays and then we will make proposals in September, if the markets allow us to do so. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, allow me to ask a question as I, like you all, am very worried. If you look at the statistics, they show that from September onwards, we will increasingly see a situation in which some countries will have made unswerving efforts over a period of several years, and other countries will not have made such efforts. These countries will refuse to continue and will no longer be able to pay for solidarity because things are going badly for them. Therefore, in the Democrat groups, we must also, from August onwards, discuss the formulation of real proposals. For we cannot spend money that we do not have. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that the Member States tackled the real problems and had the courage to answer the real questions. It is time for the European Council to finally adopt tough measures on 28 and 29 June, rather than settle for fall-back mechanisms that are immediately overtaken by events. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), these real questions in actual fact boil down to one: are we ready to make the necessary political leap to make the European Union and the euro area work? This is a question that could not be asked two years ago. Are we both clear-headed and politically courageous enough to defend and organise shared political sovereignty, or are we going to allow our laws, our policies, our societal choices to be dictated by the financial markets and banks, as we have been doing for two years now, lurching from one crisis Council to the next? (Applause)
 We must assume our responsibilities once and for all. What we want is a European Union with a social and fiscal model, and we need to show this. This is a difficult time and, in times of crisis, we move forwards and not backwards. We have to face reality and stop deluding ourselves. The reality is that no country in Europe can tackle global challenges, whether economic, social, demographic, military or political, single-handedly. We see this every day. Each Member State says, ‘I do not need Europe, I do not need Europe,’ and, the next day, it asks for help. Members of the Council, the reality is that, over the last 60 years, we have achieved peace and prosperity and that this has been possible thanks to a method, the Community method. I believe deeply in this method, just as I am convinced that Europe is the solution and not the problem. So, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 and 29 June, notwithstanding such important issues as economic governance, the credibility of the euro, and financial perspectives, the PPE Group will, first and foremost, call on the Member States to make a choice, a major choice that will determine the rest: do you want to ensure a future for Europeans and to focus on what is really important, which is to ensure strong political integration through the Community method? Or do you prefer to keep on pretending that you have economic sovereignty only to find, the day after each summit, the day after each meeting of Finance Ministers, that the decisions taken are inadequate and untimely and that we are heading for disaster? Do you prefer, as you did on 7 June in relation to Schengen, to withdraw to your borders and fall back on your intergovernmental arrangements? If you go for the first option, Parliament will be happy to work with you to find lasting solutions to the problems of our fellow citizens. However, if the Council stubbornly refuses to agree on the main issues, we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel in the short term. Those are my requests to the Council. I would also like to request that the President of Parliament be finally given the opportunity to debate with the Heads of State or Government all the subjects that will affect the future of Europeans. The President of the Commission has his place in the Council, as does the President of the Central Bank. Is the democratically elected President not as worthy as the President of the Central Bank? (Applause)
 The person who represents 500 million Europeans, presides over the only institution elected by universal suffrage, and who leads the institution that legislates with the Council is asked to leave the Chamber after he has given his presentation. What democracy, what transparency can we demonstrate to the outside world? European integration cannot be achieved without the democratic legitimacy embodied by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, I will end by saying – and I know that you repeat things time and again, as we do, in this Chamber – that we need to continue to make recommendations. We need to continue to table new proposals on social and fiscal union and we must not be afraid to publicise them. Go ahead – Parliament is with you. We are the driving force behind the proposals, and the Council needs us in the difficult crisis situation in which it finds itself. It needs to find solutions and we need to put them on the table, even more so than we have done so far. You can count on us. I would also like you to go further and publish, every three months, an up-to-date table of the economic and social measures on the internal market taken by each of our governments, both on the right and on the left. Europeans need to know which Member States are making an effort to get their public finances back in shape and to promote growth and jobs and are not just talking about doing so. All these proposals need to be continued. We are going to haul Europe out of the crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, what the PPE Group wants is honesty with regard to our fellow citizens and, above all, a great deal of political courage. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 I think I have always had the courage to say what I think and I have had it all my life. It is the only thing I inherited from my father, who told me, ‘Take care never to be taken hostage,’ and whenever I was taken hostage, it never lasted more than two days, I assure you, Mr Cohn-Bendit.

 Mr President, I will try to stay calm, even though I am absolutely seething. Minister, we had already been provoked, and you have provoked us even further this morning. However, I will stay calm. (Applause)
 By deciding unanimously, against the opinion of the European Commission, to alter the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the interior ministers have made a decision that is completely unacceptable to the Group of the European People’s Party. I would like to thank Ms Malmström for the courage she showed right to the end. She did not bend under pressure from the Council. (Applause)
 Ms Malmström, we will need the Commission over the next few weeks, as the debates will be tough. Minister, I am surprised that you did not introduce visas at the same: you would have protected our 500 million consumers even more. (Applause)
 By proposing this initiative, you have broken the bond of trust with this Parliament: this initiative has broken the fundamental principle of the community method in a very dangerous way and, as you know, I am very attached to that principle. You have attacked it and you will find us blocking your way. This principle prevents the larger Member States from imposing their will on the smaller States. It ensures that Europe’s general interest comes before national interests. You have broken that, my friend. The European Parliament and Commission are the guardians of this community method, and we have no intention of giving up on it. Last Thursday, I asked the Presidency of the Council, in the person of Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is a former member of the European Parliament herself, to appear before this Parliament to explain her position. She telephoned me yesterday evening, and I think she ought to have been here this morning, because the community method is important and she knows what she is talking about. The Danish Presidency does not have enough respect for Europe’s 500 million citizens to even bother to tell them why it has denied its Members of Parliament the right of codecision on a subject as important as freedom of movement. As far as I am concerned, since the evening of 7 June, the Danish Presidency is over. Between now and midnight on 30 June, we will address either the Council or the incoming Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus. You should know that I had to think long and hard before saying that, but you have broken the community method. That is something that must not be done. (Applause)
 At a time when the economic and social crisis we are going through calls for a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and respect from everyone and from all our national and European leaders, you have broken that respect. By withdrawing their trust in Parliament, the Member States are going in the opposite direction to the one that will allow us to come out of the crisis from the top down: in other words, via political integration between us. The solution to our problems is not to withdraw behind our borders; quite the opposite: the solution is shared sovereignty and joint management, in a spirit of mutual trust and of respect for the thing we hold most dear: our freedoms. Our group asks the Council to reverse its decision. Only by doing this will it be able to come back to this European Parliament. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are celebrating Europe. This celebration on 9 May is particularly significant at a delicate time for European integration in economic terms, but also in political terms. We often forget the progress our countries have made since signing Robert Schuman’s declaration, yet never in our history have we known such an area of peace and prosperity in spite of the current crisis. We Europeans have paid a high price to understand that there is no difference between our neighbours and ourselves. We know at last the value of tolerance, of dialogue, of solidarity, which take precedence over individualism. Ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism and the lure of populism require our attention. Left-wing populism has no more place in Europe than right-wing populism. I urge all the mainstream political parties to remember that they have nothing to gain and everything to lose if extremism becomes commonplace. Intellectual shortcuts and easy solutions are mere demagogy. They simply entertain the false hopes of our citizens, which quickly come to nothing. How, then, in this context, can we reduce Europe’s democratic deficit? As I said, Europe is experiencing a difficult period and the decisions that will be made over the coming months will determine the stability of our economies and the social cohesion of our countries. The debt crisis and the recent attacks on the markets against our currency have at least had the merit of making us aware of the deterioration of public finances that has been going on in several European countries for decades. We have shown, in Parliament, with the ‘six-pack’, with the fiscal treaty, and soon with the ‘two-pack’ as well, that Europe has demonstrated the courage to take itself to task and reverse this trend. However, our efforts have only just begun and we must under no circumstances relax them. I must say, what worries me most is this current political debate between growth and cleaning up national finances. Indeed, behind the caricatures, it is not that there are those in Europe who are in favour of good management and those who are in favour of growth, simply because they are two sides of the same coin, as I have often said here in this Chamber. The reality is that we cannot separate deficit reduction and growth, and you have said so yourself. There will be no sustainable growth unless we reduce our debts and this reduction will come about all the more quickly with strong growth. The reality is that growth-stimulating measures cannot be synonymous with additional spending. We no longer have the resources. The reality is that, as long as the most spendthrift countries refuse to lead debt-reduction policies, the countries that are themselves making an effort towards sound management will no longer be able to show solidarity. Ladies and gentlemen, confidence is what will come from investment and growth. I am not talking about artificial growth. There is only one way to achieve this: enhancing the competitiveness of our economies in the context of globalisation. Europe has a promising future so long as we all assume our responsibilities and we implement the decisions that have already been adopted. We know very well what is needed: completing the single market, investing in research and development to continue to play the leading role among 21st century economies, and reducing administrative burdens to unlock the potential of our SMEs and our companies. It is in this way, and by cleaning up our public finances, that we will ensure growth and that we will create jobs for the future. Robert Schuman’s declaration paved a new way for Europeans. Now more than ever, we are bound together. We are united, responsible for one another, and this involves budgetary convergence, which is under way, but also fiscal and social convergence. Yet this solidarity can only work if each of us makes efforts and is ready to combine cleaning up public finances with sustainable growth. You know that Robert Schuman’s declaration brought us a project for peace, which has been a success. Let us say it too. However, I should like to finish with these words: solidarity, responsibility, enthusiasm, conviction and let us have a project for the future, for growth and for employment. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of European fiscal discipline, we have achieved a lot in a short space of time. What we did was necessary, because in 2008 and last autumn, we were on the brink of disaster and we almost lost everything: the euro, our financial system, but, above all, our credibility in the world and our social model. We now have the instruments for greater discipline. We needed to do all of this so that Europe could regain its credibility. We needed to do all of this to create the conditions for a return to growth. Growth which, being the only way to get us out of crisis, must be at the heart of our debates, starting with this afternoon’s. We cannot achieve growth by passing laws, but what we can do is create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth. How so? Firstly, by focusing on European policies for growth and employment and putting others on hold. This means acting quickly to conduct a qualitative audit of European public expenditure so that we can make informed decisions. The EU budget must be one of the key instruments for kick-starting the European economy. Therefore, having done it with fiscal discipline, I propose a joint initiative committing us to growth, an initiative that would make the EU budget a reserve for investment for all of us. The growth principle needs to be the equivalent of the principle of subsidiarity. This principle would mean that each proposal, each EU policy would, in future, have to demonstrate how it contributes to growth. No potential for growth, no money. That should be our rule for the next two years. This principle would mean that we could, for example, examine the issue of trade agreements. Are we gaining market shares or are we losing them? Are we gaining jobs or are we losing them? Another point close to my heart, as you know, is the single market. Twenty years after its launch, as I have already said and I will go on saying, we have a duty to achieve it fully. Our 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises need it, because unlike the major players, they cannot adapt to the competitiveness gaps that still exist today. We therefore have to do it for our SMEs, the very ones who, over the past decade, have created 85% of new jobs. Business leaders are now being accused of being rich. Did you know that, like me, these bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises earn at most just EUR 1 000 to 1 200 and are looking for contracts that will guarantee employment to the workers of their SMEs. Here, too, Mr Barroso, we need to support them so that the banks offer finance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Instead, they are dropping them, and that is not right. We need to establish a more effective support. We need to adopt a much stricter approach in order to maintain support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These are jobs that exist and we do not want to lose them. On the completion of the single market, let me add another point: we need to reduce paperwork and red tape which, alone, costs our economy nearly EUR 40 billion. We need to simplify matters in order to move on. Ladies and gentlemen, the growth we need to kick-start our economy is not the growth of the future. What we need, right now, is to rapidly increase the added value that these companies bring. What we need is productivity gains in public services. What we need is an employment policy adapted to the new situation and I welcome the proposals adopted by the Commission this morning in this regard. The markets have already shown renewed confidence in the Union. This confidence will remain thanks to the unprecedented discipline and solidarity of Europeans. Such solidarity was inconceivable just two years ago. I also welcome the Commission’s plan for putting the Greek economy and its public finances back on a sustainable path and for guaranteeing financial stability in that country and in the euro area as a whole. It is now up to our Greek friends, whose courage I commend, to stay the course, before and after the upcoming elections. Ladies and gentlemen, we must make the most of this new impetus to step up a gear and urgently refocus the EU’s action and budget on real growth. I would like to thank the Commission – José Manuel and his team – for their work, which is no mean feat, and I also call on the Member States to move up a gear as they are the ones with deficits. It is now time for them to move back up into top gear to restore growth and jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 I will do what my friend, Georges Marchais, used to do. I did not understand the question but I will give you an answer anyway. Anyhow, my dear friend, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is responsible for what is happening in the various countries as we shoulder our responsibility. If we have made mistakes, then we need to accept where we went wrong. That is the first point. As for the second, I do not understand what you are saying about my group. We voted for the ‘six-pack’, that was the first point. We are currently preparing the ‘two-pack’, and I do hope it will be based on the growth and employment model favoured by you. As I way saying … I do not really know what you were driving at … I am also a company director working on a voluntary basis to manage my company employing just 160 people. I do not get a penny from it. We have faced difficulties four or five times now and, each time, with the help of my employees, we have managed to get ourselves out of trouble. However, we are not yet out of the crisis and that is why I maintain that it is vital that we keep the jobs we have and create new ones. That is my answer, my dear friend. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, you are aware of what is happening in Argentina as concerns the threat of nationalising YPF, a company in which the Spanish group Repsol is a shareholder. We are calling for a debate with a resolution because we wish to protect European investments in third countries and, more specifically, to react to the unilateral and arbitrary decision taken by the Argentinean authorities. We are calling for this debate to take place tomorrow and for a resolution to be drafted that we can work on and later put to the vote. We do not need to adopt it tomorrow. We can do it on Thursday. That is our group’s request. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your appointment, and I wish you a great deal of courage for the next two and a half years, since we all need good proposals to create jobs in Europe. I think there are two lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The first is putting national and regional finances back on track, and it can wait no longer. The signing of the fiscal treaty, with 25 members, two days ago, shows that this lesson has been learnt by the most far-sighted countries of the EU. The treaty imposes an obligation on its signatories to show good faith, honesty and discipline. However, everyone knows that actually applying a provision is more important than signing it. This is where we are waiting for the Member States, and for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties. Everyone remembers how the Stability Pact was infringed by the largest Member States. Everyone remembers that a certain President of the Commission even called it ‘stupid’. I therefore welcome the fiscal treaty which is, with the ‘six-pack’ and, soon, the ‘two-pack’ as well, a useful instrument. However, I would like to call for vigilance regarding how they are actually applied. The second lesson to learn from the crisis is the emphasis to be placed on a return to sustainable growth and growth that creates jobs. I must say that, in this area, there has been no real progress since the start of the crisis. The Council meeting in January merely contented itself with making recommendations to the Member States, without any coordination or overall plan. As for the Commission, it is working extremely hard, but the many initiatives it is undertaking would be better understood and more effective if they formed part of an overall project, particularly a project for growth and employment. Above all, I am struck by the difficulty and also the slowness with which too many Member States are applying the rules to which they have, nonetheless, made a commitment. On this point, I also expect the Commission to be more vigilant in its efforts to put Member States back on the right path. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is proposing two courses of action, which it will place on an official basis in a public letter to the Council and the Commission. The first area concerns the internal market. At the end of this year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market. However, 20 years on, there are still more than 150 bottlenecks hampering the operation of that market. It is for this reason that I am calling not only for us to ensure that the rules that have been adopted are actually applied, but also for a legislative package to be put forward, together with a precise timetable to enable us to complete the internal market. This is an urgent matter and within in it we can find, as I say every day, at least a small percentage of growth for all the countries, which is very important at this difficult time. The services sector, which is vital for Europe’s economy, constitutes in itself one of the largest blockages. Prices vary within the European Union; they can be up to twice as high for medicines, three times as high for medical treatments, four times as high for certain kinds of insurance and 100 times as high for the same university qualifications. When we know this, it is clear that action can wait no longer. Of course, we cannot do everything at once. It is for this reason that I call upon the Commission to start with a new legislative initiative in 10 sectors of the internal market. The second course of action recommended by the PPE Group concerns the investments needed for growth. I am also proposing, on this point, that in the European budgets for the next few years, a share allocated to investments generating growth and jobs should be protected. Let me be clear: it is not a question of new expenditure or additional budgets, but of channelling funds that are already available towards sustainable investment. Finally, we must provide ourselves with our own resources. It is not widely enough known that one euro invested by the EU can produce, through its multiplier effect, up to EUR 5 in investment. To take the example of energy, in 2010, the EUR 4 billion injected into the sector ended up generating EUR 22 billion in investment. I will finish with this: our fellow citizens, particularly young people, need jobs now. Our economy needs small growth to begin with and guaranteed growth for the future. The budget pact will ensure healthy and honest finances. Mr Barroso, I believe that on this point, you are right. We must combat tax evasion more rigorously. You have quoted the figures, and it is an enormous problem. We must act to create jobs, while the completion of the single market and the protection of the investment budget ought to generate sustainable growth and jobs. Joseph Daul  (PPE

Mr President, I would simply like to know what the reaction of my friend Guy Verhofstadt is, since Mr Sarkozy does not have a representative of the Front national
 in his government. We have a problem regarding the Netherlands, where the government has never condemned anything. That is much more dangerous and much more insidious. The second thing I would like to ask him is this: when Neelie Kroes says that Greece must leave the euro, I have never heard Mr Verhofstadt criticise the suggestion. Please answer these questions.

 Madam President, Vice-President Reding, thank you for being here and thank you, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council for attending this sitting. This afternoon, we are talking about racism and discrimination. These are serious issues, but they are clearly not serious enough in the eyes of the Dutch Prime Minister for him to come and debate them with us. Nevertheless, it is because of a partner in his parliamentary majority that we are forced to hold this debate today. Over and above his empty chair politics, I regret, above all, that the Dutch Prime Minister is refusing to distance himself from a website that is racist, violent and misleading. Indeed, it is wrong, first and foremost, to say that European workers do not contribute to the Dutch economy. Throughout Europe, the economy has benefited from the mobility of workers from Central and Eastern Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, although it is not perfect, the internal market, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of the pillars of Europe and there is absolutely no doubt that Dutch companies have benefited from it over those 20 years, as have companies from other countries, and that they have taken advantage of the Central and Eastern European market. Indeed, since 1993, those companies have invested more than EUR 23 billion in Poland, they are the largest investors in Romania and I congratulate them on that. However, beyond the economy, I ask the following question in particular: what message is the Dutch Prime Minister sending when he refuses to condemn the PVV website? That the single market is only for goods and services, and not for workers, men and women? That there are good and bad workers, depending on the passport they hold? The internal market is not a one-way street. Its rules apply to everyone alike. They apply to services, to financial transactions and to workers. I will say it again: Europe is not just a single market; it is also and, above all, a community of values. We know only too well that discrimination, racism and xenophobia led to the darkest pages of our history. Here among us are Members whose parents fought and died to liberate Europe and the Netherlands 60 years ago. Can we in all good conscience remain silent and fail to respond to the incitement to hatred of certain parties? I will simply repeat what the Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke said: ‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) reiterates its moral appeal to the Dutch Prime Minster to condemn the offending website clearly and quickly and, like Ms Reding, I am very pleased that here in this Parliament, the democrats have tabled a joint motion. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trust is the foundation of the single market, the foundation of the European Union. However, the financial crisis has undermined this trust, the trust that our fellow citizens have not only for each other but also for policy makers, and this distrust continues to grow. In the face of this danger, we must be unambiguous. We need measures to restore confidence in the good management of our finances and the Treaty to be signed next month will be one of the cornerstones of this. We also need measures to restore confidence in the governance of the euro and this cannot be achieved by issuing contradictory statements. In this regard, I am very surprised by the statements made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the Commission, who is of the opinion that it would not be a tragedy if Greece left the euro area. I ask the Commission: is this your official position? I would ask the Commission to address this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, after years of imprudent management of public finances in many of our countries, now is the time for change. This applies even more to Greece of course, but we will not avoid spending cuts —and Greece cannot take any more. Our Latvian friends showed the way some years ago, by reforming their public management without any outside help and accepting painful sacrifices that led to a return to growth. That is why, for my part, I also trust in the Greek people’s enormous sense of responsibility and I am not among those who would have them believe they will immediately overcome the crisis without reforming. That said, as I stated just after the last European Council, it will take more to build the economy than growth and employment reforms. However, the package proposed to us at this stage is not, in any way, up to the challenge. I firmly believe this is no longer the time for business as usual. It is time to make commitments on a par with those of the post-war Marshall Plan or even the 1992 single market project. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for Europe to be ambitious. The time has come to establish a project which mobilises all our resources to restore growth and employment. My group expects the European Commission to propose a legislative package of this kind, in close cooperation with Parliament, as we did with the ‘six-pack’. This package could include measures as ambitious as completing the internal market. We need to know which countries are still blocking this market. The Single Market Act, the Services Directive and the European Patent are all being blocked by an absurd dispute over location. This package must also reduce the burdens imposed on our businesses which stifle their competitiveness. In return, leave it to them to commit to providing more employment, above all, for young people. Ultimately, there is no magic formula for overcoming this crisis unless we demonstrate political will, have the courage to tell our fellow citizens the truth and see through our commitments. As a former manager, I can tell you, I have lived through many crises and I would ask the Commission and the Heads of State or Government who are always thinking of the next election — I understand this and therefore, it is up to us, in Parliament and in the Commission, to show them the way, to put forward proposals, bold proposals for major projects, for example — to establish the internal market and condemn those who do not. These are measures, small measures, which together will perhaps allow us to quickly return to 1% growth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr Fox, no, we need rules, and I am a firm liberal like you. However, allow me to explain my liberalism for you. Imagine a football pitch. There are two teams playing.

Mr Lambsdorff, I do not wish to be rude but although I know Ms Kroes well, as she has been with us for a long time, I see things differently. If Greece files for bankruptcy, there are some insurers who will pay out 75% to certain companies. If it does not file for bankruptcy, these companies will be forced to give up 75%, or even 100%, of what they have invested in Greece. I am simply asking the question and we will ask Ms Kroes whether she ever thought about this. Secondly, I spoke to Mr Samaras on the telephone yesterday evening. He expelled 21 members from his party on Sunday. That is what I call a brave man. Have you ever expelled 21 members because they didn’t vote in favour of a text? It is clear to me that Mr Samaras does not lack courage. He proved this on Sunday evening. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in this Assembly, we are convinced that Europe must both restore its public finances and find the road to growth. That is what you have just said to us. I would like to say to you, Mr Monti, that the economic reforms that you have undertaken in your country serve as an example of this twin approach. On the one hand, you have continued with many reforms initiated by the previous government, and this too you have told us about. On the other hand, you have made major changes, especially by liberalising some professions. That is the right approach as it will create jobs and stimulate competition. Thanks to your proposal to introduce a type of flexible security, you will strengthen the social market economy, and you will make the labour market more dynamic and more protective too. Your fight against fraud and in favour of a more transparent tax system is equally appropriate and will allow a reduction of the tax burden borne by Italians. My group supports this package of measures which, I will repeat, serves as an example for Europe. I hope that many countries will follow suit, since a return to growth requires us to re-establish a favourable economic and political climate. We also have to give hope back to our fellow citizens, not a false hope that would soon be dashed as it foundered on the realities, but a hope based on the development of a more competitive economy and on the indispensable reforms of our collective lifestyle. Now, like most European countries, the Italian economy is strong, as it is built on a real economy, on competitive sectors that are full of potential. Mr Monti, you have begun to optimise this potential, to free the economy from burdens that were overwhelming it. We must do likewise in all of our countries and take our example from those who do it best. We must promote under-used resources via, as you said, both national and European policies. In particular, we must allow our SMEs, our researchers and millions of Europeans, especially the young unemployed, to develop their potential. This policy requires a spirit of responsibility, the very one that you, my dear Mr Monti, are displaying at the head of your government. For some, there is a great temptation to confuse public spending and investment, as you have said, but it is only through investment that we shall achieve sustainable growth. Former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, used to say that one cannot fall in love with the internal market. On the day after Saint Valentine’s Day, neither can one fall in love with European competitiveness. However, Mr Monti, in the report that you have published on the re-launch of the single market, you laid out some good pointers on how to restore growth and employment. I would like to speak about greater fiscal coordination between the Member States. I would like to speak about a new impulse for political and social support for the integration of the European market. I would like to speak about the internal market which, almost 20 years after its launch in 1993, remains unfinished. You reminded us of this. Mr President, although everyone knows how much I favour the Franco-German engine, to the same extent I wish that, like Italy, other countries would make their opinions, their proposals or even their counter-proposals heard. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome your determined commitment to the Community method and to European integration. Like the European Parliament, you know, Mr Monti, that the return of the intergovernmental method would be a serious mistake, a retrograde step for the 500 million Europeans. I am grateful to you for having punched to your full weight. Carry on opposing this intergovernmental method. You have the majority of this Parliament with you. This Parliament wishes to make another voice heard, that of a united, responsible Europe, that of an integrated, political Europe. We know that we can count on you as an ally in this. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, as we speak, more than 600 people have died in Europe, victims of the cold and, above all, isolation. This is an opportunity to remember that Europe is not just about economics and finance. It is first and foremost about solidarity, and the spell of cold weather affecting our people is an opportunity for us to prove it. Yet what are we seeing? Food supplies for European food aid programmes are at their lowest and here we have called for help for the NGOs in charge of them. Some EU countries have taken these programmes hostage and have only renewed them until 2013, using legal problems as an excuse. We are also seeing that not enough is being done in response to the real scandal of food waste. I am referring here to all that is being thrown away by major supermarket chains every day when we all know that there are organisations that do not have enough food to hand out at the moment. It is high time that we reacted by putting our support networks into action. Having been mayor of a village for many years, I know that it is at local level that things first play out and I welcome the informal assistance networks that have sprung up over the last few weeks. These are the most effective networks and these are the ones we must support. We must also react by extending the European food aid programme. It is also high time that we promoted a common energy policy. What, then, are the facts? Today, people in need are having their gas and electricity cut off because they cannot pay their bills. Yet we are reacting much too slowly in all our countries. Here too, we must call for help. Finally, Mr Barnier, we must update the basic European civil protection project that we are so desperately lacking. We must act to stop the same tragedies and the same emergencies from happening again year after year. We have experienced them and we must be prepared. We must provide our NGOs and our fellow citizens who are dealing with these issues with the necessary means to do so rather than passing them over to large organisations. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, 25 Member States faced their responsibilities by agreeing to sign the fiscal treaty. They decided to fight against the poor budget management which has left us without the necessary room for manoeuvre to stimulate growth and employment. They showed their ability to find European solutions to European problems, even though two Member States decided that they would rather go it alone, which they will live to regret. I have, at this stage, three wishes. The first is that this treaty be ratified as quickly as possible, the second is that it be applied as quickly as possible and the third is that this agreement be fully integrated into EU law, as Parliament has called for. Ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has forced us to rethink our bad habits. It has forced us to respect the rules of balanced budgets, which are obvious, yet so difficult to apply. We must reduce national deficits, which also often cover up regional and local deficits. However, while the decision on this treaty is the correct decision and a positive one, the decision on growth leaves me rather disappointed. This is because combating deficits and stimulating growth are two sides of the same coin. One without the other will not help Europeans to escape from the difficulties they are facing, particularly the unemployed. There are two ways of boosting growth: one is artificial and has no future, the other is structural and therefore sustainable. The first is to kick-start the economy through spending. That is what we have been doing for years and look where it has brought us. Never mind the fact that, today, spending is actually limited, as the time has come to repay our debts, and not to borrow. The second method, the one recommended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is to make our economy more competitive. This could already be done, Mr Barroso, by finally completing the internal market. All the laws, all the texts were adopted long ago. The problem, once again, is that they have not been applied. I therefore call on the Commission to let us know as soon as possible which countries are not applying these rules and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties by placing restrictions on those which do not apply them – perhaps even France, my friend, as I make no exceptions. All Europeans should know which States are playing the internal market game, and which States are slowing it down or standing in its way. Increasing our competitiveness could also be achieved by reducing the charges that weigh heavily on entrepreneurs and by reducing the considerable discrepancies in charges between our countries, which harm competitiveness. This could also be done by getting as good a return as possible from European Funds that have been allocated to the States but have not yet been used. The time has come to make the best use of this – considerable – surplus by investing it in common projects to create growth and employment. Finally, growth and job creation can be encouraged by turning public funds, which are not bringing in investments, towards research and innovation, or towards training. With a quarter of young people looking for a job, we must offer them the chance to acquire strong skills and to redirect them anywhere in the EU. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, chairing the Council of Ministers of the Union at this time is not an easy task, but I am sure that, after your training as an MEP, Prime Minister, you are fully equipped for this task. Madam President, I endorse the four priorities under which you have so classically positioned your six months at the head of the Council, namely, responsibility, European dynamism, green Europe and security. I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide. That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however. My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency. I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors. The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method. Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth. Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency. Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens. I wish you all the best for the next six months. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, in 2010 Hungary’s citizens entrusted you by a very large majority with the task of carrying out reforms. You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election. The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature. Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly. Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr President, what we are dealing with today is a fundamental discussion about our values and rights. I would like to ask Mr Swoboda: did this Parliament ever have to ask for a commissioner to be sent to Hungary because of repression under the socialist regime? I have never heard of Parliament having made such a request, and no repression of the sort took place. Do you acknowledge that? Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, for once, I am not the first to speak up, but I would just like to point out that a debate has taken place. We are a democracy. If it is not working properly, the democrats are there to listen, to move things forward and change. You have all been to Hungary, as have I. For the time being, you can still move freely in Hungary and I do believe that we will be able to move around Hungary for a very long time to come. Politics is politics, but in Hungary there is freedom of movement. Yet it is true that it is not just Hungary facing the current difficulties; we are all facing them. This applies to the whole of Europe. The current crisis will increase the number of poor and I do not think that it is the Hungarian Government at fault for this. Nor would I accuse the governments of yesteryear blaming them for the deficits. We all have a duty to find the solutions. I am sure that here we are looking for solutions with Viktor Orbán, as he is no Chavez – a name which it pains me to use here in this debate, in a democracy, in a democratic house, this is one step too far and not normal. He is here, even if he is not perfect. Who is perfect? Let he who is perfect cast the first stone. I think that together we will find a solution. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, my dear Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you and to congratulate our new President. I wish you a great deal of courage, lucidity and strength to guide this institution, which collectively represents 500 million Europeans, in the most dignified and responsible way possible. However, I should firstly like to pay tribute to Nirj Deva and Diana Wallis who also stood as candidates to the Presidency of this institution. I should like to say to them that, although the two main groups in this House took the political decision at the beginning of this term of office to entrust the Presidency of Parliament to one of their own Members in turn, my group respects Mr Deva and Ms Wallis for standing as candidates and thanks them for their contribution to this election. However, this morning, Mr Schulz, I should also like to thank your predecessors and, in particular, Jerzy Buzek, whose capabilities as a statesman, which were already well-known in Poland, have been of great benefit to Parliament. Mr Buzek and, before him, Hans-Gert Pöttering and all their predecessors, starting with Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, all of the Presidents here today who have succeeded one another, have, in their own way, strengthened the powers and competences of this institution. Your political action, Mr President, will follow their lead. Mr President, for years we have had the opportunity to work together as chairs of our political groups. For the most part, I do not share your political convictions and our respective political groups have differing opinions on a number of subjects. This has not stopped us from placing our trust in you because, in the difficult situation facing Europe, what brings us together is far more important than what divides us. You are determined, as you have just told us, Mr President, to defend the European general interest resolutely in the face of diverse national interests. My group can only support you fully in this mission, in this action, knowing that the coming months will be one of the most critical periods that Europe has experienced since its creation. In our view, you have three priorities: defending the Community method, supporting the Community method and safeguarding the Community method. Nothing is more important than defending European heritage, namely, guaranteeing the general interest, protecting the small States from the bigger ones, and respecting their points of view without allowing it to lead to a deadlock. Nothing is more important than coming out of the crisis on top, through greater European integration, and nothing is more important than showing our citizens that the euro will be a strong, sustainable currency, insofar as we are doing what we should have done since its creation, namely, implementing political and economic governance. Finally, nothing is more important than preserving the common good that is solidarity between 500 million Europeans. Ladies and gentlemen, by creating what would become the European Union, the founding fathers have left us with a challenge the likes of which has never been seen, namely, uniting the destiny of countries and peoples who, in the past, tore one another apart and fought against one another for centuries. Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi rose to this challenge, and their successors, to this day, have kept this European dream alive in spite of the economic and internal difficulties, and in spite of a radical shift in the global geostrategic situation. It is our generation’s responsibility not to fail in this task. It is up to us to overcome the financial crisis, the current crisis of confidence, to guarantee our children – and you have said it yourself – not only a viable future, but, above all, a better future. This is a challenge primarily facing you, Mr President, and us, ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives of the people of Europe. It is up to you and us, along with the European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to display enough responsibility to convince our States that shared sovereignty, that real economic and political convergence, are our best tools to face the challenge of growth. Mr Schulz, as President of this institution, you will have to face many external challenges, and the PPE Group will be at your side to help you in the European spirit I have just mentioned. We would also encourage you to transmit this message to countries such as Ukraine, where Yulia Tymoshenko has faced unacceptable treatment, or Syria, where the population’s will to change has been unspeakably repressed. You are also planning to improve the internal functioning of Parliament and I welcome this. Your predecessors have largely paved the way and the recent adoption of a code of conduct is fully in keeping with the desire for greater transparency and greater responsibility from each of the Members. My group will therefore support you on this front. Mr President, from now on, you will be leading an institution unlike any other in the world: a plurinational Parliament, which votes on legislation. For two and a half years, you shall be the leader of a House that does not seek to impose on the Council the idea that we will not overcome our current difficulties by creating a new treaty, a new Parliament, new governance, but that seeks to convince the Council of this. Mr President, we will join forces behind you each time you defend this integrated Europe, this Europe of solidarity, this Europe that delivers innovative solutions. We will join forces behind you each time you plead the case of common European policies, as well as each time you fight for funding to live up to the ambitions of these common policies. Finally, we will join forces behind you each time you defend and promote the ideas and values that are the foundations of our Union beyond our borders, namely freedom, tolerance, respect for the weakest in society and solidarity. Mr Schulz, I wish you every success in your Presidency. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Presidents, Mr Tusk, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, rather than speaking myself, I simply wish to subscribe to your speech. At the end of the day, when it comes to speaking about Europe, your discourse is my discourse, it is ours, the discourse of our group, and indeed the discourse of many people within this Parliament. On 6 July, you gave us your vision of a Europe proud of its values, of its successes, of an inclusive Europe, of a Europe confident in its power to exercise its influence throughout the world. This is a vision that we share. Paradoxically, the current crisis may turn out to be a unique opportunity for Europeans to recover their enthusiasm, to bounce back, providing that we are able to adapt, providing that we are able to change our habits and the way we operate. Prime Minister, you indeed have suffered, and you know what suffering is. The old Europe no longer knows what it is to suffer. President-in-Office of the Council, with your government – I shall use just three of the examples that you have mentioned – you have helped to achieve, over your Presidency, the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance. The Polish Presidency, working in close collaboration with the European Parliament on an ambitious package for strong national public finance management, has shown that the Community method can be effective and can sit very well with the euro and the European Union. Similarly, we can credit to this Presidency progress on the supervision of financial markets. More generally speaking, Poland has been working side by side with the European institutions to advance the notion whereby it is an advantage and a way out of the crisis to share economic sovereignty between the 17, the 17 plus and Poland. As you so rightly said, and as I said yesterday, we must put together a way out of the crisis for our fellow citizens for January/February. Second example: the neighbourhood policy. The Polish Presidency has worked extremely energetically, both on the Eastern front, with the signing of the accession of Croatia, and with the launch, last September, of the Eastern Partnership, with the preparation of the association agreement with the Ukraine, and on the Mediterranean front, with European support for the current democratic process. I thank it for that. The third and final example is that in the field of law, the Polish Presidency has enabled considerable progress to be made both on the protection of patents and on European contract law. I hope that we will still be able to carry these through to completion under your Presidency. My group hopes that these efforts will be rewarded and that the final agreement will be signed in the days to come. President-in-Office of the Council, the Polish Presidency has not just produced legislative texts. It has supported a principle dear to my parliamentary group and to the overwhelming majority of this Parliament, namely, the Community method. Indeed, your country, like all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, is more aware than any other country in Europe of the price of freedom, and the importance of solidarity. You have made effectiveness and respect for other people’s opinions a priority, without seeking to impose your own point of view. For many of our Member States, this is an example worth following. We are counting on you – for when you stand down from the Presidency, you will remain an influential member of the Council – to ensure that this Community method returns and is implemented. I shall finish this speech by inviting every one of you in this House to read attentively Minister Radek Sikorski’s Berlin speech. On 28 November, he reminded us that we Europeans are in the uncomfortable position of standing on the edge of a precipice. If we take action, we can emerge from this situation, if not, we shall plunge into the abyss. The Polish Presidency has helped us to take action together. We now need to continue resolutely along this path. I shall repeat a sentence from a very well-known Pole, John Paul II: ‘Have no fear’. Let us work along the lines that you described this morning. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council opened the way, last Thursday and Friday, to governance of the euro area. It showed that the period of waiting, uncertainty and divisions is now behind us and that an end to the crisis is finally in sight. Twenty-six out of 27 States have demonstrated their desire to revert to a healthy finance policy by establishing strict rules allowing for a return to balanced budgets and a reduction in public debt, and by agreeing to incorporate those rules in their constitutions and ensuring that any instances of non-compliance are punished. Twenty-six out of 27 States have shown a sense of responsibility by ensuring that their main political and economic decisions are taken jointly, and by developing crisis mechanisms to be implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB). Twenty-six out of 27 States have conceded that shared sovereignty is preferable to sovereignty held hostage by markets. In short, the spirit of cooperation has prevailed over the attempt to create divisions. Determination has proved stronger than indecision. Three major issues still need to be resolved: that of the nature of the new agreement, that of the United Kingdom’s place in Europe and the attitude of the 26 towards it, and, finally, that of the crucial ‘growth’ strand of our economic policy. Ladies and gentlemen, since the United Kingdom has refused to support the decision taken by its counterparts, the resulting project is not a Community one, as we were hoping, and as I have often said, but an intergovernmental one. This situation presents us with a number of problems, not only legal problems, but political problems, too. My group calls for the European institutions to be fully involved in the discussions that will culminate in the drafting of the new provisions between now and March, and, in particular, for Parliament to be accorded its rightful place in this process so that it can ensure its democratic legitimacy. I solemnly call upon Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso to work closely with the European Parliament. We must ensure, in fact, that no radical changes are made to the spirit and the letter of what has been done for the last 60 years and what has made European integration the success that it is. Cohesion must continue to prevail over power struggles, something which only the Community method can ensure. The second major issue raised by the decision of 9 December concerns the United Kingdom’s place in Europe, and I will come to this. I respect the decisions that were made but, clearly, the UK’s isolation shows that its government sees the European Union as nothing but a free trade area, and that it has no interest in showing solidarity with, and acting responsibly towards, its partners. To my mind, this calls for a change in behaviour towards the country by the 26 and also, to some extent, within the European institutions. In particular, I believe that the UK rebate should be called into question, since the resources of our fellow citizens should be used for something other than rewarding selfish, nationalist attitudes. Solidarity is not a one-way street. It is time Mr Cameron’s coalition government was made to realise that and was reminded of its obligations, in particular, with regard to the financial regulation rules from which it even requested an exemption, which fortunately was refused. The third and final issue relates to the ‘growth and employment’ strand of our economic policy. Of course, there will be no growth unless we put our public accounts in order, but the Union must now set about strengthening and developing its industrial activities, exports and competitiveness with the same level of energy and coordination. Indeed, Europe will not resolve the crisis permanently without a radical two-pronged approach consisting of sound management, on the one hand, and growth, on the other. As far as Parliament is concerned, I believe that we need to work closely with the Commission, on the basis of the proposals it made two months ago. I believe that we must do so, Mr President, in order to overcome the crisis, and that we must vote by a very large majority in February. This is what I propose as ‘homework’ for the Christmas holiday, and on that note, I wish all of you and your families a very happy Christmas. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to reassure my fellow Member. With Christmas nearly upon us, I have neither a tank nor a Kalashnikov. Therefore, he is not in any danger over the Christmas holiday; you can be sure of that, Lord Dartmouth. Secondly, I clearly said that, if, as I believe, the United Kingdom has given up on showing solidarity with the other 26 States for now, then I do not see why the 26 should make a further concession regarding the budget. Let me be quite clear: this is not a declaration of war; it is simply about ensuring that solidarity is shown between everyone and not just one way. That is all! Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis is turning everything on its head and things are changing at an increasingly dramatic pace: changes in Greece and Italy, with the establishment of governments of national unity, which we welcome; whereas until now, our citizens saw European integration as being far removed from their day-to-day lives, now they are calling for more integration. Well, not everyone, as just yesterday, David Cameron saw fit to attack a Europe to which, last time I checked – yesterday afternoon –, his country still belongs, when what we really want is constructive positions, even from him, on how to emerge from the crisis. Still, all the influential players in the Union acknowledge – as I have been saying for years – that the answer to our problems is not less but more Europe. The solution is Europe. I think some presidents realise this. Those who do not are replaced; which is a good thing. A Europe that needs to be transformed along the lines of integration which should have been done when the euro was created because, I will say it again, the current crisis is not just a crisis of the euro which, this morning, Mr Juncker, was still trading at around 1.35 against the dollar – or 1.34 as it might have dropped a centime, which is still acceptable. The reason for this crisis is the mistake made in setting up a currency without giving it the governance needed to make it work. We need to acknowledge this political error, but, above all, we need to put it right, and very quickly. That is what the euro area Member States are being forced to try and do and, once again, I congratulate the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, which is hard at work but which, in my opinion, is not working quickly enough because when your house is burning down, the fire-fighters get to work and, I tell you, fire-fighters are never criticised. I used to be a voluntary fire-fighter myself. We would sum up after the fire: we would look at what had been lost and what could be improved. That is what I am asking of you, Mr Van Rompuy. Do not be afraid. Be stronger. We will work it out later. However, once again, I want to emphasise the importance of crisis management which is a new source of division in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing it more and more, we need to take care to distinguish between those that are in a deep crisis and those that have managed it better. We need to recognise this. I want to stress how crucial it is that the Seventeen take into account all the instruments of the Euro Plus Pact when making any decisions on governance of the euro area. Mr Juncker, this is your job, do it. There are many countries wanting to join the euro area. We must not create different categories of players in this Euro Plus zone. We must not leave those countries wanting to join warming up on the sidelines. We must not exclude them from strategic decisions taken in the dressing rooms. I want to underline, here, the merit of countries like Poland, which has the Presidency, and which, despite not yet being in the euro area, are making extremely brave efforts, from a political viewpoint, to clean up their finances and boost growth. We should encourage them; we should make them feel a part of our club. Similarly, and I shall say it again, we should not abandon the Community method. As much as I firmly believe that the Franco-German alliance is a key driving force in Europe – which recent weeks have again proved –, I call on all Member States to contribute and go further than Paris and Berlin, instead of complaining about the impetus provided by Paris or Berlin. Nobody is stopping them. Likewise, Mr Barroso, I also call on the European Commission, with your commissioners, to do everything in your power to safeguard, strengthen and shield European cohesion. Do what you can to reassure small and medium-sized States that the Community method is still the glue that holds us together, that makes us stand firm and binds us together. It is in times of difficulty that it needs to be reinforced. That is the main responsibility of both institutions, the European Parliament and the Commission, which stand up for the European general interest. I want to finish my part in the debate on a possible revision of the European Treaties. Yes, changes will definitely need to be made to put right what is necessary. Yes, these will definitely have to be major adaptations, given the significance of the issues at stake. My group is open to this process as long as there is open, democratic debate involving elected representatives and civil society as part of an agreement. Above all, however, we must not fall back into the temptation of spending all our time talking about the mechanical tools, to the detriment of our political objectives. We must not lose sight of what is urgent, namely credible economic governance, and of what is less urgent, and let us do what can and must be done to current treaties, if necessary by making small changes to the rules of procedure as I call them. I am thinking of the establishment of the internal market, of the rules governing financial supervision or credit rating agencies. I am thinking about the political role played by the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for economic and monetary affairs, which is yet to be defined. I am thinking about the rapid implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of macroeconomic surveillance. (The President interrupts the speaker following an interruption off-microphone from Mr Bloom)
 I am thinking about real budgetary, fiscal and social integration. Mr President, it is Europe which speaks while the anti-Europeans scream and shout. That is not my way of moving Europe forward. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, to start with, I would like to point out that in life, one can either see the glass as half full or half empty. I see the glass as half full. I would like to thank you for the work you have done over the last 48 hours, because as a farmer, I know that it is not always the right horse that gets the oats, and this morning I would like to give you the oats and tell you ... (Laughter and applause)
 If he does not like oats, he can give them to the Commissioners; no problem there, a few of them like them. The elements that I picked up straightaway from your speech, and which I want to reiterate here, are that we are dealing with the banks, we are not doing enough to challenge the rich, you understand what I mean by that, but above all, and I thank you for saying it, we need to take care of the poorest. It would be outrageous if we failed to find a solution concerning the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons before the winter months. (Applause)
 Some people thought that everything would be sorted out by Monday. I do not think anyone here in this House believed that, since we are responsible men and women. However, we were still apprehensive, and late last night I watched the news to see whether we would effectively have an even deeper crisis this morning or, as I have often said, whether we would start to see the end of the crisis take shape. I believe this Council has at least come up with an initial solution to the crisis, and I congratulate both of you – I know that it is not easy. Undoubtedly it does not go far enough, but I will come back to this. I also wish to highlight the progress made by the 17 countries in the euro area. Over recent weeks, we have seen the 17 countries in the euro area being criticised by those who are not part of it. I would like to point out, in this Parliament, that we are all Europeans, whether we are inside or outside the euro area. Nevertheless, we have duties and rights, and those who took centre stage the most were the 17. Here too I believe we have made progress. With regard to solidarity with Greece, following the release by the Troika of a new tranche of loans, the agreement announced last night with the banks sees 50% of the debt being written off. This is an achievement. The increase of the European Financial Stability Facility’s firepower is a step in the right direction and, as everyone knows, one of the trickiest aspects of the negotiation. The agreement of the 17 on this point is absolutely crucial. By ensuring that this Fund acts as a credit insurance for investors who buy loan certificates from countries deemed vulnerable, the resources of the Stability Fund will be increased. The third area in which progress has been made is bank recapitalisation. I believe that we have already referred to this. Consequently, the European Council and the euro area have kept their promises for the short term and for part – a small part, I would stress – of the medium term. My group encourages you to progress even more quickly, and you are not on holiday as far as I understand. Tomorrow morning further progress will have to be made. The most important thing is to adopt a new model of economic governance, without which the euro cannot work effectively in the long run. We say the same things every day here, but we can see that by dint of repeating ourselves, some things are starting to be done. This integration and this European policy are an absolute necessity. I note that the countries which are the first to ask the euro area to take strong action have, for years and even decades, vigorously rejected any proposal for fiscal harmonisation. They are quite simply being inconsistent. Ladies and gentlemen, the European project is not about imposing something on someone. The European project is not about placing anyone under supervision, nor about governing with no regard for the democratic balance of powers. However, the rules must be complied with, Mr Barroso, and we must ensure that the measures that have been accepted and signed on paper are truly applied in practice. The European project and the strategy for Europe are about an ambition: that of offering the 500 million inhabitants the chance to live with dignity. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) does not want us to depend in future on Chinese and Brazilian investment, but to draw on our own work and our own know-how. What the PPE Group wants is to map out the route that will lead to that outcome, and that requires a shared European sovereignty between all those who want it. Mr Van Rompuy, yesterday you made good decisions, difficult and brave decisions. Nonetheless, these measures are not the end result of a plan to exit the crisis, they are merely the beginning. I call on the Member States, I call on Members of Parliament, both national and European, and I also call on our fellow citizens to agree to further political integration. I call on this Parliament and, Mr Barroso, on the European Commission, to carry on defending the EU model, which is a model of inclusion and not exclusion. I hope that next week, the G20 will respect the decisions that Europe has taken. For that to happen, though, they must be sure that we will not stop halfway. We need more fiscal and social integration, even if it is not written in the Treaty. We need to move forward in that area. We cannot afford to wait 10 years, to wait until we have amended the Treaty. We must adopt rules of procedure if the Treaty cannot be implemented quickly. I think that we are in the process of proving that in the difficult moments of managing a crisis, we can make progress without respecting the Treaty to the letter. And that was a little painful for us in the European Parliament. We felt to some extent that we had been forgotten. However I do think, Mr Barroso, and you said so this morning, that you are applying what we voted for here. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, once again, our Parliament is being asked to debate the decisions that we expect to be taken by a European Council and, once again, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is calling for a European response – an EU response – to the crisis. Once again, a resolution will be adopted, tomorrow, by an overwhelming majority of MEPs, calling on the Heads of State or Government to show a sense of responsibility when they meet on 23 October. Like most of my colleagues who are present, I sometimes feel as though I am repeating myself and taking part in a discussion between the institutions and our Member States in which everyone is talking at cross purposes. Yes, we agree on the significance of the crisis, on the urgent need to come up with solutions, and on the vital mix of deficit reduction measures and measures to boost growth and employment, but we differ as to the measures that need to be taken and whether those measures should be taken piecemeal or with surgical precision. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must stop debating the ways in which it could possibly take its decisions and whether or not it should embark upon yet another reform of the Treaties. Europe must stop analysing, weighing things up and, above all, hesitating. Europe must act; Europe must put a stop to the debate about solidarity with Greece. Of course it must show solidarity, and the decision taken by the Troika yesterday was just as responsible as the political point-scoring episode in the Slovak Parliament was irresponsible. Europe must stop questioning whether or not we should cut our public deficits. Of course we should tackle public deficits at national and regional level! It is just a question of knowing how to do so and of making sure that any action we take is completely fair from a fiscal and social point of view. President Barroso, I am not going to read the text that I prepared for the Commission. I am simply going to congratulate you and tell you that I agree with what you have said today and that I am behind it. The only thing I would add is that I wish you luck in getting it past the Council, and you will have the support of our political group. Go for it, do not be afraid. Measures need to be taken before Christmas. Thank you very much, then, for this presentation that you have delivered to us today. When I talk about Europe, I am not just talking about Brussels and Strasbourg. I am also talking about Bratislava, London, and all the European capitals. They must understand that real sovereignty is not just the gilded treasures found in republican or royal palaces. Real sovereignty, ladies and gentlemen, is the ability to give our fellow citizens the life they deserve, the standard of living they work for, and freedom. We will not achieve that by withdrawing behind our national borders, closing the Schengen borders again or bringing back protectionism. Growth and jobs – although I know that the anti-Europeans do not agree, and I love the fact that they are grumbling, because it means that we are on the right track (Applause)
. Mr Farage, you gave a good example of this at the last Conference of Presidents, and I hope that it will be the same today – growth and jobs, President-in-Office of the Council, will only materialise again in Europe if, as from 23 October, our Member States play the game, the European game, the solidarity game, the game of ‘all for one and one for all’ fully, unconditionally and quickly. Let me say it again, for the third time in my speeches: we need to bring into line tax rates, retirement age and weekly working time, to mention just a few examples. My group has not given me enough time to list everything that is impossible in Europe. However, you know that the word ‘impossible’ is not in the French vocabulary. Therefore, anything is possible, and that is also my party’s slogan. Europe must act, and I am convinced that it will succeed. President Barroso, we need a response for our fellow citizens. What kinds of questions are we having to answer today in our campaigns? When I listen to people who have worked hard all their lives, who have a savings book, I find that the question they ask is: ‘Are our savings and what we have struggled to acquire throughout our life protected by Europe and the euro?’ Yes, they are protected! Yes! Therefore, that is the response we must give them; that is the guarantee we must confirm to them. We have a duty, at Heads of State or Government level and in the European institutions, to give them that initial response. As far as everything else is concerned, you are right; we do have the tools, we do have the political means. If we implement them, we will overcome the crisis. Moreover, I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that European countries are not the only ones that are contacting our offices today. We are also being contacted by those who are already worried about whether we are going to succeed and whether the euro, at EUR 1.10 perhaps, is going to revive the European economy in relation to that of other continents, which are beginning to ask themselves questions. As you have said, then, let us take action together, ladies and gentlemen; let us not play cat and mouse, but let us be bold. I am convinced that we are now going to pave the way for our exit from the crisis, for Europe’s exit from the crisis, so that we can restore it to its place in the world in which we want to live. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 The answer is very simple, Ms Jaakonsaari. We have done the following: last weekend, four of my colleagues travelled to Greece to hold talks with our sister party, in order to move things forward, as you mentioned in your question. We are therefore working on this issue every day, and at the end of the week, three more people travelled to the country. We are working in close cooperation both with the party and with the Greek delegation, and we are also discussing this issue within our group. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr Barroso, it is heart-warming to hear such a speech. Like you, I may give an analysis, but after this speech, we will act together. Europe is going through a confidence crisis and a growth crisis. As if that was not enough, it is going through a leadership crisis. It is high time that Europe came up with a political answer to the crisis. A united and strong answer, which puts politics in its rightful place, that is to say in the driving seat; I am talking to the Council. Because, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about a currency – the euro – created 10 years ago. We truly believe that we are giving ourselves the means to secure its governance. We talk about countries which, for decades, have lived above their means, always more, without wondering whether or not the money spent actually created growth and jobs. We talk about a Europe born to prevent internal conflicts and to ensure its peoples’ prosperity, a Europe that, until now, has succeeded on all these fronts. But we also talk about a Europe that is misunderstood, even criticised, because its leaders have not been able to explain why the choice of Europe is the only choice for the future and why the answer to global challenges can only be a European one. All too often, one forgets that the European Union is one of the most advanced and developed regions. It is the world’s leading power in terms of trade. Our duty is above all to make sure that it remains in that position. What is the problem, then? And how can it be solved? The problem is that, even though economists agree on the reasons behind the financial and economic crisis, and on how to respond to it – namely a mix of rigour and incentives for creating wealth and employment – the political class has not had the courage to set about the task. The reforms proposed these last few months by the Member States of the Union and of the euro area, in particular, are along the right lines. However, they are clearly insufficient, late and poorly explained, or not explained at all. They stem from the intergovernmental method which – it is plain to see – paralyses Europe, as you rightly said. The national approach, ladies and gentlemen, must give way to the European approach. We do not want to discuss subsidiarity here, but the Community approach is the only one that will enable us to meet in a united and effective way the urgent and huge challenges that are before us. I can understand that, in times of crisis, one feels the need to turn in on oneself. No, we must reach out and seek the Community approach. The European method is not two, three or four Presidents bringing different messages, but a single and swift exit strategy. Mr Barroso, you are the head of the executive for economic governance. You demonstrated it this morning in your speech. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) urges you to fully play your double role of proposing and implementing European legislation decided with the Council and Parliament. The Commission has a crucial role to play: that of guarantor of the European general interest. This is difficult and demanding, but necessary: we must resist national interests which are not always compatible with the common interest. (Applause)
 This is essential. That is why this Parliament placed its trust in you at the beginning of the mandate and continues to do so. Mr Barroso, I ask you to go even further in your ambitions, because there is urgency. There is urgency to save the euro, to demonstrate our solidarity towards Greece and towards all the member countries that are seeing their markets attacked and their rating downgraded. At the same time, it is urgent that these same countries adopt and implement measures that are a match for the events, for European solidarity comes at that price. We must act urgently, not in the months, but in the days and weeks to come, to prove to the world that Europeans are able to defend and stabilise their currency. If they do not do it, the whole European project will suffer in the long term. The decision that – I hope – this Parliament will take today on economic governance, the famous ‘six pack’, is an important step in the right direction. We now have to apply it as soon as possible, and the same goes for the decisions of 21 July on the stability funds. Mr Barroso, entrepreneurs need visibility and security. The markets expect the euro area and the countries of the Union as a whole to take strong and consistent measures for reducing expenditure but also for supporting growth. On the first aspect – that of streamlining public expenditure – a few days ago I called for a ‘big bang’, a common decision of the 17 on fiscal, budgetary and social convergence. I reiterate this call today. It is very difficult for one country in isolation to take the strong measures that the euro area’s financial situation requires. However, we must recognise that the election campaigns that are coming up in several European countries in the next few years will undoubtedly not be conducive to courageous measures. Therefore, I ask the Commission to seize the proposal to bring into line tax rates, particularly for businesses, but also retirement age and weekly working time. Europeans will only stand shoulder to shoulder with each other if they see the same rules applied. That is when we can feel European. (Applause)
 I am convinced that strong and swift decisions by the 17 on this triple convergence would have considerable impact and would be a tangible sign of leadership on Europe’s part. Ladies and gentlemen, I said this earlier on: the current crisis is as much a crisis of confidence, which calls for collective decisions like those I have just described, as it is a growth crisis. And without growth, Europe will be unable to reimburse even the interest on its debt. Without growth, Europe will not be able to develop or survive competition from emerging countries. This growth requires increased competitiveness, more resources allocated to education and training, as well as increased efforts in research, development and innovation. I call for a new public-private partnership with a view to creating centres of excellence in research and innovation and to creating – why not? – an Erasmus programme for first jobs, following the success of the Erasmus university scheme. I would like to see the European political policy-makers listening more to entrepreneurs and to social partners, since they are the ones who live with the reality of globalisation and who can help us emerge from the crisis. Ladies and gentlement, achieving growth also requires that we pay special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must not ride roughshod over them. They are the ones who bring us jobs and who help us to overcome the crisis. Yet they are asked to bear administrative, fiscal and social costs that are too high. If we want them to be able to expand and hire people, this growth will require greater flexibility for investing as well as for keeping and creating jobs. Ladies and gentlemen, the single market was the great idea of the 1980s. With the single market, Europe has won growth points and our manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale by gaining access to a continental market instead of a national one. Nonetheless, we all know that the European single market is far from being completed, especially in the services sector. I am asking the European Commission to get down to the task with as much ambition and determination as it showed 20 years ago. That is where growth is. Ladies and gentlemen, growth cannot be decreed. It is achieved by a whole series of structural measures, the ones precisely that we have already adopted in the Europe 2020 strategy. We now need to roll up our sleeves and above all apply these measures. It is time for Europe to speak strongly and intelligibly, not only to counter populism, which is the enemy of the European people, but to propose long-term solutions that our citizens understand and expect. It is time that our elected national representatives accept that voluntarily shared sovereignty is the only future for our countries, and I mean the only one. I am asking you, Mr Barroso, to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council a plan to get us out of the crisis. A plan that can be, for the 500 million Europeans, the chance for a fresh start, the chance to overhaul their project. We need bold actions and proposals, understood – I repeat – by our fellow citizens. Europe has always made progress in crises, but we still have to make the right proposals and believe in them. I always say that, before the crisis and after the crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. Things will be different. Mr Barroso, we must propose this change to our fellow citizens so that once again they believe in politics and in Europe. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, for weeks and months now, the leaders of the euro area have shown how determined they are to stand up for the euro and to make European solidarity the cornerstone for their political actions. Yet we need to recognise that what has been decided since the summer is not enough, is too late and, above all, difficult to implement. You get the feeling that it is the markets rather than politics now in the driving seat. That cannot last. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that only strong and simultaneous EU decisions will have the necessary weight to reassure our fellow citizens and the markets of our decision-making ability. Mr Juncker, intergovernmental management of the crisis has reached the end of the road. As both a head of government and President of the Eurogroup, can you tell us then what the plans are to get us out of the crisis? The worst thing is that we cannot see a way out. There are a number of instruments: Eurobonds, guarantees from AAA countries, quadrupling the stability fund’s firepower, but over and above these instruments, where is the political will and how do we bring it all together? We need to be strong and, above all, we need to lead the way in getting out of the crisis. So where are you? (Applause
) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the European Union has been seeking sustainable solutions; however, faced with the attacks on the euro, initiatives have been taken. I am referring here to the first public finance consolidation measures and to the positive golden rule proposal. I am also referring to the introduction of measures to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility and the establishment of new economic governance instruments, or the six-pack, on which I should like to see a definitive agreement reached before the end of the month. I am also referring to the coordination of national budgets and to this summer’s proposals regarding European economic governance, the financial transactions tax and tax harmonisation. (The speaker broke off due to an interpreting problem)
 Mr President, since the start of the crisis, billions of euros have been committed. European citizens are indeed concerned, as they can see no end to the efforts being asked of them. They feel as if they are feeding a bottomless pit, even though they are aware that this European crisis calls for a Europe-wide response and not only a national one. They question the ability of national and European leaders to end this crisis of confidence and growth once and for all. The markets remain unsatisfied, doubtful and particularly volatile, and react to the slightest rumour. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come, for eurozone Member States and for any other EU Member States that would like to be involved, to pull out all the stops and adopt strong measures, together and at the same time, to put an end to the doubts over the EU’s capacity to shoulder its responsibilities. President Barroso, President-in-Office of the Council, Europe must restore its credibility. Europe must face up to reality and regain control of public finances. It must prepare itself for a transitional period characterised by stringent financial management at both national and regional level, and by incentives for savers and for investment in innovation, education and training. Europe must undergo a dramatic transformation to be referred to as the federation of the United States of Europe, or simply integration. In this crisis, as in any other crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. The question is: are we capable, right now, of envisaging a different future for ourselves? I recommend that, on the basis of a Commission proposal, all eurozone governments and all other EU governments who so wish, take a decision to drastically reduce their debts by taking coordinated measures, all at once and on the same day, to ensure the viability of their pension systems and to actually harmonise their taxation, in particular their corporate taxation. By suddenly making economic governance a reality, and one that is accepted by all the Member States of the euro area, the EU would achieve two things: it would demonstrate its capacity to take long-term action, and it would strengthen cohesion between citizens, who would at last be subject to the same rights and obligations. By taking coordinated budgetary discipline measures while stimulating crucial growth in our economies, countries would establish a single or converging set of rules and would send a clear and strong message as to their will to further integration. I should like to say a word, President Barroso, about growth. We are constantly saying ‘growth, growth’. Many people still dream of achieving double-digit growth. Our primary duty is to sustain low growth and avoid deflation. The European institutions, for their part, must be more ambitious as regards common policies. We need those policies that we refer to regularly: a trade policy, an ambitious research policy, a food-safety policy, an industrial policy that has finally undergone reform, and above all a policy enabling the internal market to function properly. We have many regulations, but in these difficult times it remains to be seen whether they are actually applied. If there are things which need revising, we will revise them, but there is no need to add to them in the current climate. Let us also enhance integration of the euro area, the heart of European integration, in order to help reform the European Union. That is what we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for, as we are aware of the responsibility of the centre-right, which is in the driving seat in times of trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, our credibility is going to be at stake over the coming months. It is true that we are under very heavy attack, which is probably exaggerated in some areas. It is now up to us to show that the EU has the capacity to restore growth conditions and avoid succumbing to deflation. This, too, will safeguard employment levels. Everything must be done to protect our way of life as much as possible and to defend our values. A major integration effort is ultimately not the way to succeed. Instead, ladies and gentlemen, we must find a way, among responsible democratic political groups, of showing a new approach and a new path to our Heads of State or Government, who are in a very difficult situation. What I am asking of this Parliament, and of President Barroso and the President-in-Office of the Council, over the coming weeks, is unity, that is to say a single vision for European citizens for the four or five years to come. That is what we must work towards today. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, I will give a very brief answer to that. If agricultural support in Poland is harmonised, taxation will also be harmonised to a certain extent. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, by way of an introduction, allow me to say, Mr President-in-Office, that if, during these six months, you apply the European method you have described this morning – as I do not doubt you will – we will be considering ways to extend the Polish Presidency of Europe. (Applause)
 European integration will be at the heart of the priorities of the new Presidency of the Council, to the great satisfaction of our group. This integration, and especially this Community method, must feature in all the major debates over the coming months and years. I am thinking of the financial resources of Europe. It is a significant issue that we will discuss together for the 2014-2020 period. I am also thinking of the internal market. Mr Tusk, you are concerned about the rise of Euroscepticism in several countries. I share this concern, as does my group. Euroscepticism and isolationism are symptoms of a cancer in our society. Your response to this ‘every man for himself’ attitude is a call for integration, which echoes the watchword of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is not the problem, but ‘more Europe’ is the solution. Your Presidency will be dominated by the necessary consolidation of public finances in the Member States, the stabilisation of the euro and the opening of the debate on the financial framework. The euro can only be stabilised if the countries experiencing difficulties really implement the necessary reforms in order to reform public finances and to create the conditions to enable a return to sustainable growth. Half-hearted measures will not solve the underlying problems. If I take the case of Poland, which is growing by nearly 4% and, with an uncommon level of efficiency, has known how to best use EU funds since it became a member, I see that European solidarity, combined with political will, can lead to the construction of a real, solid economy. Mr Tusk, you are one of the few Heads of State or Government in Europe to agree to debate with the national parliaments, with this Parliament and with other European institutions about the issue of the resources needed for Europe to operate. You are, moreover, the only one willing to discuss an issue that is important to a large majority in this Parliament, namely, the introduction of own resources to finance Europe’s role. Therefore, we will be by your side to deal with this issue seriously and we know that this task will be challenging. The Presidency of the Council believes that all our economic and social policies must be based on the Europe 2020 strategy, which all Member States have already accepted. It is right because the economic crisis will only be overcome in a sustainable manner if the Member States understand that all 27 States acting together is less expensive and much more productive than each one acting in isolation. Solidarity, ladies and gentlemen, is not just virtuous; it is also profitable. That goes for European finances as well as for the internal market and I am pleased that the Polish Presidency has established this issue and, in particular, electronic services, improved working conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the long-awaited creation of a European patent system, or indeed the Single Market Act, as its main concerns. Mr Tusk, just like the European Parliament, you have found the recent disagreements on the Schengen issue hard to bear. My group supports you in your desire to strengthen our resources and our joint effort on our external borders. In this regard, I call on the Commission and the Council to take a clear position on the unilateral decision made by Denmark to exempt itself from the rules on freedom of movement. My group would like to express its serious concerns. I would like to know what your position is, and that of the President of the Commission. (Applause)
 Mr Barroso, some commissioners will not be able to take holidays in July and August, since it will also be necessary, at this time, to closely monitor the Danish borders. I stated yesterday that perhaps we should think about introducing visas for Danes to be sent to Europe so they are better protected! Just as the European Parliament has done, you have identified the key challenges for Europe, which are food security and energy dependence. It will certainly not be possible to resolve all these issues in just six months. You will at least be able to take the credit for raising them and, as I told you when we met in Warsaw, it will be you who will lay the foundations, and I am certain that they will be solid foundations. I shall conclude by commending your determination in the management of relations with your neighbours. We have recently often discussed support for our southern neighbours, and firm policies on this issue should be developed. Relations with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, as well as with other countries like Ukraine and Belarus, in particular, are just as deserving of our attention and efforts. Mr Tusk, my group has great expectations of your political will and your leadership. I shall conclude by drawing inspiration from the words of a great Pole whom you know well, Pope John Paul II: ‘Do not be afraid, Mr Tusk: go ahead; we are with you’. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has shown how the rotating Presidency has continued to play an important role in our decision-making system. We have to recognise the importance of the advances that have been made in these last few months on a number of fronts. Firstly, there are the advances on the economic front, with the progress that has been made on governance and the success of the first-ever European Semester. Secondly, there is the common policy front, with the measures taken concerning social cohesion, the common agricultural policy, food security, the single market, the Danube strategy and, of course, energy policy. Thirdly, there is the external front, with the accession of Croatia, but also the expression of our solidarity with our Japanese friends and with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Let me inform you, Mr Orbán, of the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on most of these points. First, I want to thank the Hungarian Presidency. In particular I would thank the Minister of State for EU Affairs, our former fellow Member Mrs Győri, for the enormous efforts she has made towards taking the governance package forward and, in particular, granting Parliament’s requests for the Community method to be applied. We have been successful on 90% to 95% of our requests. I am very disappointed that, because of the stance some people have taken, we cannot reach a conclusion this week as planned. Without economic governance, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no stability for the euro. Without a stable euro, the chances of Europe winning the battle for growth, and thus the battle for employment and social cohesion, are next to nothing. The PPE Group is convinced of this. President of the Council, I also want to emphasise the progress that has been made on common policies since January. There has been progress on the cohesion policy, with the agreement reached in February on the strengthening of this device in the coming years. There has also been progress on the common agricultural policy, with the agreement reached in March on the broad outlines of the reform, against a background of worrying increases in the prices of raw materials as well as ever greater challenges in relation to food security. Thirdly, there has been progress on energy and innovation, strategic themes to which an entire meeting of the European Council was devoted at the start of February, one month before the Fukushima tragedy. Finally, there has been progress on the single market, which will be consolidated further thanks to the Single Market Act. On all these major topics, the Hungarian Presidency has made progress in spite of a difficult political and economic environment. I would add one important element to that, namely the policy on the Roma, on which you, Mr Orbán, have been able to conciliate the Europeans and propose specific actions. I am particularly grateful to you for that. I will end by mentioning the advances made in the area of external affairs. I have already had the opportunity to welcome the progress made by Croatia during the last few months; it is only because of this that the 27 were able to give it the green light for its accession in accordance with the timetable that President Orbán wished for, starting in January. This accession is good news for the Croatian people. It is also good news for the peoples of the Balkans, who must be able to rely on a concrete European perspective. The events that have occurred in the Mediterranean, too, have dominated the Presidency to a great extent. Europe has managed to give a clear demonstration of moral solidarity, but has also shown real solidarity with its southern neighbours, and it has also managed to resolve the problems that arose concerning the economic refugees who immigrated to the Italian coast. At the same time – and I am particularly happy about this – the Schengen area has been opened up to Romania and Bulgaria, not in order to do them a favour, but because they are respecting the rules that apply to everyone. This shows that European solidarity has to be earned and that effort is rewarded. I thank the Hungarian Presidency and wish all the best to the Polish Presidency. Joseph Daul,

Madam President, you know that I am always very brief. Martin, we are proper Democrats –
 you respect democracy and so do we. It is true that it is easier to win than to lose. We will continue the negotiations and at the beginning of July, we will take a final vote on the report after negotiation. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Győri, I would firstly like to say a brief word to you, in acknowledgement of all the work you have done and especially of the methodical approach you employed and the hours you devoted to this work, with Parliament in particular. I think that is worth mentioning and so, once again, thank you. (Applause)
 You are applauding her, but it could not have been any other way: we have trained her well within our group. Therefore, she knows what Parliament is all about. Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances. Seldom have expectations been so high among the people in our various countries, expectations of brave and united decisions from their leaders on the burning issue of the euro and the debt crisis, as well as on economic governance. In several countries, and especially in Greece, our fellow citizens are confused, anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children’s future. I would like to take this opportunity to send out three messages to our Greek friends. Firstly, Europe is in solidarity with them, and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility – and I stress the word responsibility. Secondly, the situation that they – and indeed many other countries in Europe – are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means. This has to be said, and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality. My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term. This will involve making sacrifices, but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end. This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country’s twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation. Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking – that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) – or, after having expressed their concern, they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy. My group, ladies and gentlemen, is calling for a shake-up. It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial. We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves – and when I say ‘us’, I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens. This brings me back to the European Council, from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity. However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily, as they have done in the past. When the Council, with Parliament, decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States, it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity. We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with. If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past. I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that. I will conclude on a positive note, by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th Member State in a few months’ time. This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government, whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend. This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans, who are doubting themselves right now. However, the values that Europe embodies – solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity – have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else. I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro and public debt crisis demand solutions at European and not national level. This is the message that Mr Barroso, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, has been sending the Member States for months. However, a European solution means European funding. My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe, both in its objectives and its terms of reference. My question to the Council is as follows: is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s? Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable? I think not. It is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers. It has changed, and it would be irresponsible not to reflect these changes in the ways in which Europe is funded, in other words, in the way Europe is designed. (The speaker broke off, hoping to continue his speech later) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe’s new realities, trends and aims. Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe’s place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed. It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes. The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate. When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources. We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets. This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets. Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits. Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States. Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year. Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts. So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances. Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments. Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt. Europeans need to be told the truth. The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum. The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish. The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen. The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage. Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe’s capacity for influencing the world. The European Parliament – and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me – is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework. If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever. If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects. Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe. Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes. As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions – some more peaceful than others – taking place in a number of neighbouring Mediterranean countries and, more recently, by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism, namely, the end of the Bin Laden era. What is Europe’s role in all of this? Are we willingly and actively involved in the situation? Yes, we certainly are. The action being taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government has demonstrated that, when it wants to, Europe – or some of Europe – can act decisively in difficult times. Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding ‘No’. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion. Europe backed stability and development aid in the Mediterranean. Yet the people are – quite legitimately – demanding political freedom and are fleeing their countries because there is no prospect of a life of dignity and opportunity for them and their children. The humanitarian assistance that we have provided over recent months has definitely been useful. Baroness Ashton, we need to do more. Have we begun to learn from these events? I would like to think so. What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea – and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths – are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement. (Applause)
 Is all of this worthy of Europe, of European values, principles and ideals? I do not think so, nor does my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) nor, I am sure, do the majority of Members in this House. Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon. We now need to move on and take action. That entails making choices and sticking to them. What, then, are Europe’s priorities? Relations with our eastern and southern neighbours? Combating terrorism? A solution to the conflict in the Middle East? Trade policy? Tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task. Who are our preferential partners? The United States, emerging countries, or others? How can we achieve the best results? By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice? Ladies and gentlemen, an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs, security and defence: instead, we need more Europe. We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level. Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives. Ladies and gentlemen, 2011 should be the year of the Mediterranean, of combating terrorism, even of achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East conflict. If Europe is capable of becoming a key player in this area, it will be able to put the errors of its youth behind it. Let me close with a quote from someone very familiar to you: John Paul II. ‘Do not be afraid,’ Baroness Ashton. We have made savings of EUR 4 billion in the European budget. Please come up with some proposals for using that money, rather than returning it to the Member States. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentleman, the last European Council has set our countries on the right track. By increasing the capacity of the Solidarity Fund and deciding to make it permanent, the 27 have once again demonstrated their commitment to the euro and the importance they place on solidarity between the more financially stable countries and those facing temporary difficulties. At the same time, the decision to seal a euro pact between eurozone countries, and further afield, is indicative of the political will of European leaders to draw lessons from the financial crisis. The fact that we share a currency forces us to be more coherent in our economic and social choices. The time when countries could set an atypical rate of taxation or specific social rules without first consulting their partners is long gone. The reason for this is simple: all countries should benefit from the solidarity of their eurozone partners. Yet our people will only accept this solidarity if they think that everyone is putting the same effort into managing public funds. In this respect, the euro pact is a major step forwards towards the convergence of our economies. My group strongly supports it, but demands – and I shall continue to demand – that it is implemented in the context of the Community method, under the auspices of the Commission, Mr President. You are taking the right steps, you have done some good work, but more needs to be done within this Community method under the auspices of the Commission. That is how we will build Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, you know how stubborn I can be and I will repeat it as many times as necessary here so that no one forgets. Europe sets itself apart from the rest of the world with its model of the social market economy, a model which our fellow citizens are quite rightly proud of and which is based on the principle of solidarity, but one which is difficult to preserve in the face of globalisation. The question is knowing how to ensure its future is sustainable by striking a happy medium between the nanny state favoured by socialists, which we have seen almost bankrupt us, and that of excessive liberalism, the dangers of which we have seen with the financial crisis. Three things are needed to achieve this. Firstly, all our countries need to reduce their deficit; secondly, they need to adopt comparable budgetary, fiscal and social rules; and, thirdly, they need to invest together in innovation to boost growth, which to date is clearly inadequate. Indeed, we can only preserve and strengthen our model if we invest in growth sectors: green energy, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, and so on. Given our limited financial room for manoeuvre, the best way to meet the growth challenge and achieve economies of scale is to pool our skills as well as our capital. Without massive investment in innovation, without a genuine European plan, we are denying ourselves the ability to keep up with our competitors. Ladies and gentlemen, while our Heads of State or Government were meeting, 10 days ago, the Fukushima power station continued to be an issue of global concern and the insurgents in Libya were looking to Europe for strong action. On these two matters, our countries and the European Union have shown a great sense of responsibility. We have in fact offered Japan our nuclear expertise in what is an extremely difficult and worrying situation for that country, and also for the international community at large. There will no doubt be a pre-Fukushima and a post-Fukushima. Although unfortunately not there yet, my group wants the post-Fukushima to be a period of reflection and action, firstly to ensure that the rules governing nuclear safety are significantly tightened and, secondly, to further our efforts in the field of green energy. I agree with your approach to Côte d'Ivoire, Mr President. Turning lastly to the Mediterranean, I welcome the European Council’s repeated call for Colonel Gaddafi to relinquish power, allowing for a new page in this country’s history. What I want is for all our countries to come together and discuss a neighbourhood policy as ambitious and successful for the South as the one they were able to make in the 1990s for the East. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would simply like to tell Mr Cohn-Bendit that, in order to challenge a seat, an official proposal must firstly be made. If no proposal is made, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot analyse the situation. Before intervening in this way, I suggest that you think before you act. That is all. (Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit: ‘Yes, but he might not have a seat’)
 You are the one asking me to observe the law. I have always observed the law. Now let us leave it to the Committee on Legal Affairs to give its verdict. It cannot give its verdict without a proposal. If that proposal is not lawful, the Committee on Legal Affairs will tell us. Let me say again: let us think before we act. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is preparing to meet for the second week running amid a climate of international uncertainty and tensions. There is the uncertainty in Japan, where the level of human loss is still difficult to determine, and uncertainty in the Mediterranean, as further populations rise up against their regimes, in Bahrain and as you mentioned President-in-Office of the Council, in Yemen. Inevitably, all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe. Our fellow citizens have witnessed Japan’s drama unfolding live. On top of the empathy we feel for the thousands of families shattered by grief, as we speak there are fears associated with the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the dread of the dangers that we too could face in a similar or comparable situation. These events should certainly be taken on board by all countries that have nuclear power plants and it is good that this Parliament is organising a debate on nuclear safety, though we should not lose sight of the fact that in Europe we need to be increasing and not reducing our energy independence. This is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session. This weekend, the 27 Heads of State or Government will also be discussing the UN decision to intervene in Libya to save the insurgents from imminent attack by the regime. I would like to highlight the fact that European States have taken the initiative in these operations and were the first to intervene within the framework of the UN mandate, which itself was the initiative of several European States. No doubt they heard what us MEPs said during our last part-session here in Brussels. My group would like to see the Council take this opportunity to further develop the EU’s Mediterranean strategy, whilst maintaining the goal to help and support but never to impose. This is our duty as neighbours. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following last week’s euro area summit, at which the groundwork was done, the Council’s flagship measures this week will relate to strengthening the euro and making progress on economic governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of increasing the funds available to support the euro and of making the ad hoc instrument we adopted last year to help Greece and Ireland more permanent. This political will reflects the responsible attitude that Member States have taken in managing this unprecedented crisis in our single currency’s history. However, we wish to stress very strongly that these exceptional circumstances that the loss of control of national public finances has brought about must not be seen by the Council as an opportunity to adopt a different method for managing European affairs. The Community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception. A very strong majority within Parliament supports this principle and the Barroso Commission also supports us in this approach, quite simply because it is vital for the future of the European Union. I am sure that President Van Rompuy will succeed in persuading the Heads of State or Government of this. The Pact for the euro should also be adopted on Friday. We welcome it insofar as it introduces provisions for which we have been calling for months now, namely convergence between Member States’ budgetary, social and fiscal policies. I cannot stress this enough: European solidarity will only be accepted by our citizens if they feel it is fair and deserved. This will only be the case if the working conditions are met and if our businesses can invest and recruit under comparable fiscal conditions. Lastly, our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament’s position as co-legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion. Europe must get back on the path of growth and employment, and the measures that are taking shape are a step in this direction. Provided they are planned within a Community framework, they will give Europe a healthy basis for a fresh start and a promising future. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal. Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments – all the amendments – requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members. Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts. The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament. My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world? Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law? (Applause)
 In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes? The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality. Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores? (Applause)
 Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same. The credibility of Parliament is at stake. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what lessons have we learnt from the financial crisis? The lesson we learnt from the Second World War was that our nations should work together and stop tearing each other apart. From the fall of the Berlin Wall, we learnt lessons about authoritarian and communist regimes and we were able to reunite our continent around the values of freedom, democracy and the social market economy. From the terrorist attack of 11 September, we learnt that we had to strike a new balance between security and freedom. From this financial crisis, the lesson we must learn is for our Member States to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary, fiscal and social fields. I know exactly how far we have come. The establishment, this year, of cooperation between the 27 on their budgetary priorities constitutes, in itself, a major shift in attitude. The regulations that we have provided ourselves with to make the financial markets more ethical are, also, exemplary, but they do not suffice. My group would like to call for an agreement to be reached between Parliament and the Council, before the summer, on strengthened economic governance. My group would also like to call for efforts to be pursued on the coordination of social and fiscal matters. That is the thrust of the competitiveness pact, the initial version of which has already been revised to be in greater accordance with Community values. However, we must go even further still and ensure that both Parliament and the Commission exercise all the prerogatives that they enjoy in this respect, and in this, we are counting on the President of the Commission. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes and supports these proposals as did the national leaders of the party in Helsinki. Ladies and gentlemen, how can we explain to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as we are in a delicate financial situation in mid-July each year, most of our Member States should continue to spend as if nothing were amiss? How can it be that the over-indebtedness of our States is more acceptable, more tolerable and more bearable than that of households or businesses? I have witnessed this at company level. The crisis has led to job losses and family trauma; the least we can do is to learn lessons from this and tell things as they are. The first lesson is that we should no longer treat lightly the obligations placed on States – whatever their size – to respect budget limits. The second lesson is this: European solidarity can only operate if, and only if, our social and fiscal regulations are at least comparable. They do not necessarily need to be identical – just comparable. At the moment, this is far from being the case. The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy. The fourth and final lesson is that even in a storm, Europe is standing firm and European integration is becoming stronger. Our American and Japanese partners have debt ratios far in excess of ours, without, it must be said, being excessively worried by it. However, that will probably not always be the case. For our part, now is the time to consolidate our economy and our competitiveness. Now is the time to work on creating jobs for the future. Now is the time to tell things as they are. Let us not miss this opportunity! Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there is something that I do not understand. Last week, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we would be holding a debate on Russia in March because Baroness Ashton would be present. Secondly, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we needed to organise a debate on Russia because Mr Putin was going to visit the Commission, or rather Mr Barroso. According to the information I have received this afternoon, Mr Putin is not coming to see the Commission. Do you have any information on this issue? The debate was requested last week only because Mr Putin was coming. However, a debate on Russia, together with a resolution, is still scheduled for March. I should now like to receive some information concerning what we discussed. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what will the European public take away from the meeting of its leaders this Friday in Brussels? Will it understand that European responses to European challenges – the euro, energy, research and innovation and employment – are being sought in good faith? Or rather that, once again, we are surrendering to the sorry spectacle of division and power struggles? What headlines will the major newspapers run? What will people be talking about on Saturday in blogs and on Facebook when they refer to the European Council’s decisions? About the timidity of Europe when faced with the situation of Mediterranean countries which long to have their rights respected, or, on the contrary, about its leadership? Europe’s duty in this regard is quite clear: it must harness all its resources and all its diplomatic skills to aid the transition and the organisation of democratic and open elections. Ladies and gentlemen, as far as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the solution to our problems lies in having more Europe, not less. The solution does not lie in more so-called national victories, but in more common victories and more coordinated responses. The solution does not lie in a lax attitude towards applying our common rules, but in greater discipline. The solution, ladies and gentlemen, does not lie in greater divergences between our budgets, our labour laws and our taxation rates, but in greater convergence. As far as the PPE Group is concerned, there is but one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, which is that, without a common vision and without shared resources, our countries will sink into sluggish growth and plunge into social crisis. If there is just one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is that, by thinking, working and investing as Europeans, our countries will emerge from the difficult patch they are going through and will be forever stronger for it. What else will make us react as one if not the difficulties that we have just experienced? Together with the European Commission, the majority of my colleagues in this House and, I am sure, the majority of the 500 million Europeans, I put the following question to the European Council: when are we going to act and react more as one? As for the euro, I now know that that our governments will hold fast and will not allow speculators to destroy 60 years of European integration. I now call on them to concentrate on the consolidation of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, as this is essential. I call on them in particular to strengthen their budgetary discipline and to keep up their efforts to reduce public debt. European governance is the sine qua non
 of the success of our common project. My group supports it as much as it supports the euro, that is to say, totally. The solution to our problems, as I said at the beginning of my speech, is to have more Europe, not less. While this is true in the cases of employment and the economy, it is also true for energy, a topic which the Council will also cover on Friday. Having more Europe means, first and foremost, fully implementing the laws that already exist in relation to the internal energy market. It can never be emphasised enough that making this market fully operational will make us more competitive, will ensure the security of our supplies and will guarantee a substantial increase in renewable energy production. Having more Europe also means encouraging our States to meet the challenge of increasing their energy efficiency by 20% between now and 2020. They were the ones that set themselves this objective. We must ensure that they reach it, or else we shall have to raise the standards they have to meet to do so. Finally, having more Europe in the field of energy means investing more. The Commission estimates that it will cost EUR 1 billion to reach the required infrastructure level. We expect ambitious decisions from the European Council in order to achieve this. Europe needs secure, clean energy just as much as it needs a research and development policy and a policy for promoting industrial innovation. Here too, the solution lies in having more Europe and paying more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The solution lies in reducing bureaucracy to a minimum and finally reaching an agreement on a European patent. In the area of innovation, too, we expect common solutions from our leaders, not parochial squabbles. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to move on from our knee-jerk reactions of the past. Promoting our differences is all well and good, but making them mutually complementary is even better. Taking individual initiatives can be useful, but playing as a team is the way to win the match. Harbouring national ambitions is perfectly legitimate, but understanding that the game is won at international level by playing as a team is the way to guarantee a future for the people of Europe. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the last European Council clearly showed that the euro is a vital pillar of European integration. Everything possible must be done to stabilise and strengthen it. Our Heads of State or Government have since confirmed their deep attachment to the European currency and the fact that Estonia is joining the euro area at the beginning of this year is yet another signal in this direction, as well as setting a very good example of how to respect standards to the major countries that fail to respect them. That said, no one underestimates the seriousness of what Europe is going through economically and socially within the euro area. Everything possible must be done in 2011 to overcome these problems and to reassure the markets, not superficially but structurally, in other words, by creating the right conditions for growth and employment in the long term. I think we are speaking the same language on this issue. Firstly, this means that national public finances must be restored to better health. Push hard for this, let us not give in! Secondly, it means that the Member States must get their fiscal policies to converge more closely, and also their taxation and social policies. It also means that we must come to a swift agreement on the euro area bail-out fund and that this fund only makes sense if it is backed up by strict enforcement of the fiscal discipline rules. Our citizens must know that the countries they are assisting in difficult circumstances are keeping a very strong check on their public accounts; otherwise, they will no longer agree to stump up, if I may put it that way. Finally, as I said, we must create the conditions for growth and employment. That also implies completing the European internal market, investing more in research and innovation, and in lifelong education and training. My group wants the EU approach to be promoted over the intergovernmental approach in all these areas, quite simply because it is far more effective and far more sustainable. Mr Van Rompuy, I call on you to ensure that reform of the Treaty, confirmed at the last European Council, be concluded as soon and as swiftly as possible. The budget debate is only just beginning. My group will continue to call for a thorough review of European public finances in forthcoming years, with the aim of once again creating the conditions for growth and employment in Europe. Mr Barroso, let us scrutinise everything, let us not be afraid and, as I have already said several times, let us take two or three different examples of budgets: for example, how can we pull Europe out of its current situation with 1%, 2% or 5%? We will not succeed by reducing resources. If we want to create jobs, we need more European resources, and this does not mean that the Member States have to spend more money. Let us not be afraid, President van Rompuy and President Barroso. Put these proposals to us and we, the Heads of State or Government, as well as Parliament, will be forced to find the right solution – but at least let us have a number of options from which to choose. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, rarely will the Presidency of the Council of Ministers have had to face so many challenges: the challenge of the euro, which we must stabilise, the challenge of employment, which is experiencing stronger growth and therefore a more efficient economy, the challenge of energy independence and food security, while prices for raw materials are rising alarmingly. I have no doubt that the Hungarian Presidency will be able to deal with these challenges, alongside the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Mr Orbán, you have won the confidence of your electorate in Hungary. Your party, Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége (FIDESZ), is based on an idea, on an ideal, on a value: that of liberty and democracy. Since your election, you have, with the Hungarian Parliament, undertaken a whole series of reforms which your people have called for by democratically giving you a large majority. Today, one of those reforms – the one concerning the media – is the subject of legal scrutiny by the European Commission, guardian of the Treaties. You yourself stated last week – and I thank you for doing so – during your talks with Mr Barroso, and since then, that were this law incompatible with European law, you would submit it to your parliament for the necessary changes. I have complete faith in your word. For my part, I, like you, have confidence in the European Commission, which plays its role as guardian of the Treaties, and I also have confidence that you will respect the letter and the spirit of the European rules. Prime Minister Orbán, we have known each other for a long time and I consider you a very great European. For my part, I have no reason to doubt that you will do what you have said with regard to the media law and to the other priorities faced by your Presidency. I now come to those priorities, beginning with the first: the stability of Europe. Perhaps it is a good thing that the two presidencies of the Council that will follow one another in 2011 will be assumed by countries that do not belong to the euro area but which wish to join it in the very near future. Indeed, both Hungary and Poland are both entitled to join it. They therefore have a stake in ensuring the stability of this currency. I repeat: the only effective way of ending the speculative attacks against the euro and of strengthening the fundamentals of the European economy is to restore order to our public finances. This involves stronger coordination of fiscal and social policies in our countries, as is quite rightly provided for by the new budgetary period for the European Semester. It also depends on greater flexibility in our employment market and greater productivity. Like the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) firmly believes that the future of 500 million Europeans depends on a stronger, more united and more coherent Europe. It depends on having more of a Europe and certainly not less of a Europe. Mr Orbán, we need European economic governance. We need more communitarianism and I am sure that you will work towards this. President-in-Office of the Council, you have defined the setting up of a common energy policy as one of your main priorities. I think you are right. Mr Buzek, our President, has also, quite rightly, made it one of the strengths of his Presidency. I agree with you on this point, but I also want to warn you about the terribly worrying consequences that may result from the increase in the prices of all kinds of raw materials which has been particularly sharp over the last few months. We have already seen the social implications in several Mediterranean countries of such a price rise in basic foodstuffs, especially for the poorest countries. I hope that Europe will take this problem seriously and deal forcefully with speculators. I also hope that the Hungarian Presidency – I thought that the Group of the Greens were going to be silent, but I can hear them talking; it is not right, people should be quiet all the way through – will back the Commission in its assistance to Tunisia, which is going through a crucial time and must be supported as it moves towards change. Mr Orbán, you know that to succeed in your mandate and help Europe through its current difficult phase, you need the confidence of Parliament. In December, when we were in a difficult position with regard to the Council, you had the courage to sign the first-rate letters for us which really helped Parliament to approve its budget. Thank you, already, for what you did in December! Even before January, you included the political groups when defining your priorities, and naturally chose Mrs Győri, one of our very fine former colleagues, as Minister for EU Affairs. These are all positive signs which, I have no doubt, will be accompanied by a perfect balance between the reforms you are undertaking and the European values that every one of us here defends.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council, which opens this week, is taking place in a particular context: speculative attacks against the euro, the revival of euroscepticism and the beginning of reflections on Europe’s finances, while this Parliament is preparing to vote on the 2011 budget. These are, of course, closely linked. The euro crisis and the solidarity measures have an impact on the purchasing power of the European people, who are wondering if all these efforts are worthwhile, if they are leading to anything, whence the euroscepticism even in countries hitherto traditionally pro-European. This is a phenomenon hijacked by populist and extremist political factions, which feed on fear and the temptation to withdraw into oneself and which, when they are in government, do not have a miracle cure. I will start with the euro, which we must protect and strengthen while, at the same time, asking ourselves some fundamental questions. My first question is this: has Europe ever had a currency as stable as the euro? I say this to those nostalgic for national currencies: a step back would have catastrophic consequences for Europe. My second question is: who is behind the attacks to which the euro has been subjected for months? Who is standing to gain from the crime, if I may call it that? I am not a conspiracy theorist but, in my conversations with political leaders and financial analysts, the paths are converging on the source of our problems. When will we learn? I think we can talk directly to our friends. My third question is this: why is the euro still trading above USD 1.30? This is seriously hampering our exports and everyone is saying that the euro has had it. Why are our countries the only ones to practise a strict policy of orthodoxy while our competitors profit from their weak currencies to boost their economies? This is what our citizens are asking us. These are questions I have been asked in the last two weeks in meetings with elected politicians. Ladies and gentlemen, what we need is a message of confidence that we will overcome the crisis, measures to encourage a return to growth and concrete measures like those taken recently by the Barroso Commission to relaunch the internal market or to make the financial markets more ethical. What we need, and the euro crisis proved this, is convergence in our social and fiscal policies. That takes courage. President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, go further and faster and we will solve quite a few problems. We are going to need a lot of courage in the years to come if we want to strengthen our countries in the arena of global competition and if we want to use taxpayers’ money in the most effective way possible. This effort to streamline expenditure must be made at all levels: local, regional, national and European. The political and financial priorities of the Union need to be reexamined and the public finances of Europe need to be fundamentally reviewed. We need to ask ourselves the real questions and, depending on the answers we give, adapt our budgetary framework for the period 2014-2020. It is for this crucial debate that the European Parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that, as the representatives directly elected by 500 million Europeans, we intend to fully participate, even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right. I ask the European Council to give us its agreement and, if necessary, to vote, so that those who deny us this opportunity to participate in the debate assume their responsibilities. It is not, for us, about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction. We must lance the boil, we must take the right decisions, the necessary decisions to ensure that the European budget increasingly becomes an investment budget. If our Member States, mindful of budgetary constraints, can invest less in education, training, research and innovation, let us do so at European level by combining our resources and, therefore, by achieving economies of scale. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the debate on Europe’s finances must not be allowed to descend into a quarrel between Member States who want their money back. On the contrary, the debate should be about reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe by exposing them to the added value that concerted and visionary European action can represent. I am currently visiting the capital cities and I can tell you that the debate is taking hold. Do not miss this opportunity. Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end, I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament, as well as José Manuel Barroso, who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June. I believe that we must continue, together, in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us. We have to show them the way. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an opinion poll I read yesterday in a newspaper states that 70% of French people believe that they are still in the midst of a crisis and that it has not yet been resolved. I am sure that a broader survey in Europe would generate the same results. We must therefore address our citizens’ valid concerns. They are living in difficult times and cannot tolerate the slow and complex decision-making process at European and global level. Many of these people have also asked me what we are doing and what Europe is doing for them and their family. People are scared. At the same time, I see that more and more politicians and more and more countries, even in this House, are using, manipulating and exploiting this fear and this anxiety and do not have any proposals. This populist approach, which is corrupting our policy, is serious, and I should like to mention here that this is not the way to resolve the real and serious problems facing our countries and Europe in the world. I believe that it is up to the political parties and the parliamentary groups that are against such populism and demagogy to speak out more. No, the answer to the crisis is not to shy away from it or resort to protectionism. No, there is no fast or easy solution to the crisis we are facing. No, it is not possible to turn our back on solidarity or on efforts to strengthen all our countries in the face of globalisation and then realise, in the end, that we need partners when times are tough. We must learn some lessons from what is happening in Ireland, and this is not a criticism of Ireland, President of the Council, President of the Commission. We must learn lessons, because the difficulties that that country is facing are due not only to the banks but also to the current government’s fiscal and economic policy over the years. The Celtic Tiger, which was solely responsible for its own growth, with an atypical tax system, minimal banking regulation and an investment code unlike that of any other country in the European Union, is today witnessing a collapse of its property bubble, household debt, record unemployment and a crippled banking sector. The Irish Government has guaranteed the whole banking system, committing EUR 480 billion, or three times its GDP, which increases its public deficit to 32%. Today, the Irish Government has called for and rightly obtained European solidarity. I welcome this and, as Commissioner Rehn said in this very Parliament on Monday, the aid Ireland should soon receive will safeguard the stability of the whole euro area. Yet has this European solidarity, which Dublin is rightly receiving today, as it did when it joined the EU, been shown over the years by the Irish Government itself? How many times have Member States tried to align taxation – a prerequisite, as is all too evident today, for good governance of the euro? And every time the same few countries oppose it. I am not pointing the finger at anyone, but I believe that it is time for us to learn from such behaviour for the future. As I have said several times in this House, a crisis signifies an opportunity for change, and we must not be afraid to change some of our customs, which have not had the positive effect we were counting on. Ladies and gentlemen, the measures adopted by the European Council a few weeks ago and the guidelines agreed at the G20 in Seoul represent a step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. In other words, there needs to be an awareness of the need for cooperation in Europe and among major regional blocs in order to address the instability of financial markets and trade imbalances and also to avoid a currency war. We all know that, on all these issues, our countries alone will be unable to find a viable long-term solution to meet the expectations of the 500 million Europeans, who, as I said at the beginning, are expecting their politicians – that is to say all of us here and back home in our capitals – to make forward-looking decisions. President of the Council, if the crisis has taught us anything, it is that yesterday’s solutions are not necessarily those of tomorrow. We are paying a high price realising this in a time of crisis, but we will pay an even higher price if we continue to ignore it. I call on the European institutions and the governments of our Member States to change, to learn political lessons from the crisis, and to stop seeking solidarity only when it is too late. Mr President, I would like to add one last thing. This is not a question of the Council and Parliament fighting against one another; it is a question of implementing the treaties, of showing solidarity, and of working hand in hand. This is the message I should like to get across to you so that we might overcome the crisis for the sake of our fellow citizens. Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 I cannot accept what you said. We live in a democratic age and under a democratic system. I would ask you to make an official apology, or else we are going to make a formal complaint. There are people who have said less than that – it is not right. (Applause)

 Mr President, if I may, what I said this morning is that Mr Bloom has behaved unacceptably. Secondly, we are in a democratic parliament. We have decided democratically, Mr Bloom, that you should leave this Parliament. I hereby ask you, in the name of democracy and of all this Parliament stands for, to leave this Parliament today. I ask you to do so out of respect for democratic rights. Mr Gollnisch, you do not need to challenge me. We know your methods. They are unacceptable, anti-democratic. That is all I have to say to you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last Conference of Presidents, we decided to put the Matera report on today’s agenda. No one asked for that report not to be put on the agenda. Therefore, the question asked by the President is as follows: faced with an individual such as this, are we going to be able to have frank discussions, as we have been used to having for five years? That is the question I am going to ask on Thursday morning. Moreover, if the European Conservatives and Reformists continue to make this person participate in the Conference of Presidents, we are going to change the way we work. That is all I have to say. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the budget comes at a time when our fellow citizens are having doubts because of the weakness of their currency and when Europe is rightly rallying in support of the Irish economy. Contrary to what may have been said about the European Parliament’s objectives in these negotiations, this is not about power struggles or institutional disputes, nor is it about ignoring the difficulties faced by our Member States or the public debt crisis from which we are all suffering. No, it is about ensuring that Europe can honour its commitments. Commitments in the social sphere, and here I am thinking of education and lifelong learning; commitments to the victims of natural disasters, and here I am thinking of assistance for countries affected by food riots; and commitments to programmes that create jobs and growth, such as Galileo and ITER. The reality is that, by looking at things from an accounting point of view rather than from a political point of view, the few Member States that continue to block the negotiations are harming the interests of the 500 million Europeans. By making the European Parliament out to be the villain of the piece, and by suggesting that it wants to spend at a time when the Member States are tightening their belts, that it wants to exercise the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon to the detriment of saving and of Europeans, they are diverting attention from the reality of the problems that exist. What is that reality? It is that the latest economic forecasts offer no hope of a return, by 2020, to the strong, sustainable and inclusive growth that the European Union set itself as an objective. It is also a fact that the current draft budget makes no provision for the financing of the new powers conferred on the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon and fails to fulfil our requests to proceed with the mid-term review of the financial cycle laid down in the 2007-2013 agreement. Lastly, it is a fact that the draft budget makes no – and I mean no – financial provision for the 2020 strategy. In short, the Council is adopting programmes without making any financial provision for them. Moreover, when the President of the European Parliament reminds it of its obligations, it takes offence, but when a local, regional or national authority approves projects without financing them, that authority is condemned. Why, I ask you, would something that is unacceptable at local or national level be acceptable at European level? Is this a way of reconciling our citizens with Europe? I do not think so. I say clearly to the Commission and, above all, to the Council: do not count on my group, do not count on this House voting for programmes that do not have guaranteed funding. My group wants a return to common sense and a balanced agreement to be reached. It must be a comprehensive agreement that relates, at the same time, to the 2011 budget, the 2010 amending budget and its associated letters of amendment, the flexibility procedure and, finally, the guarantees regarding the financing of future policies, which we call the political section. I would stress that our proposals on this political section do not involve any changes to the current treaties, nor do they anticipate in any way the amount, origin or distribution of future EU funds. I would also stress that reopening the debate on own resources is not a new proposal by Parliament, but a decision taken by the Council itself in May 2006, following the agreement reached in December 2005 under the UK Presidency. My group fully supports the objective not only of capping but also of reducing the Member States’ budget contributions. Indeed, the extremely serious nature of the debt crisis must lead to a complete overhaul of European public finances. This is not just about dividing up tasks between national budgets and European budgets; it is also about seeking out all possible forms of mutualisation in order to make savings. Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the two demands made by the Council on 15 October: for the EU budget to contribute to common financial discipline and for the funding of European objectives to be guaranteed. That is all we are aiming for in the negotiations on the 2011 budget, and we are confident that an agreement can be reached if the Council Presidency negotiates effectively with its colleagues in Brussels. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common thread between the meetings of the European Council and the G20 is the need to make the necessary adaptations after the financial crisis. For the European Union, these adaptations consist of putting our respective national and EU public finances in order and protecting our currency, the euro, by consolidating it internally and defending its value against the other major currencies. The European Council will be dominated by discussions on Europe’s economic and financial governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the initial lines that the Van Rompuy task force has taken, including the plans for a system of sanctions against Member States that do not adhere to the criteria of the Stability Pact. However, there is still more work to be done, with more Community method and less intergovernmental method. I welcome the work that the Commission has done along these lines. I would ask the Council to remember that this Parliament is now colegislator and will play a full role in defining the forthcoming reforms. The more Parliament is brought on board in the early stages, the more chance we have of achieving a satisfactory and timely outcome. I call on President Van Rompuy to heed this message. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must make its voice heard in the debate on relative currency values, and the European Council must establish our position on the subject next week, before the Seoul G20 summit. Europe must join with its partners, in particular, the United States, in reminding the emerging countries of their responsibilities. Currency dumping and the social consequences it entails must no longer be allowed. Three major subjects will be on the table at the Seoul Summit: reform of the international monetary system of course, but also the stability of commodities – especially food and energy – and global governance. Europe has a message to deliver on each of these subjects, but this message will only be credible if we put in place effective internal, Community-wide instruments to govern and manage our public finances. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to influence global governance and will not really have a place on the international stage unless we can make the often unpopular effort to clean up our finances and unless we stick to our priorities of combating climate change and development policy. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, yesterday evening, my group discussed amendments that the services have told us are unacceptable. As a result, and following the discussion I had this morning with the heads of delegation and the group leaders, I request that the vote on the calendar be postponed. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget is the first budget that this Parliament is called on to negotiate and vote on using its new powers under the Treaty of Lisbon. It is the first in which we have desisted from calling for any increase in the global volume proposed by the Commission, instead preferring a realistic and political approach. A realistic approach insofar as our Member States have been called upon to make unprecedented efforts in stabilising and reducing their public finances. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the first to call upon them to do so. The reduction in public expenditure is, effectively, the prerequisite if our economies are to become more competitive and face up to international competition under favourable conditions. It is therefore not a question of our asking of the twenty-seven, for this budgetary year, expenditure which does not fit within the efforts made by our fellow citizens within their own national framework. However, our approach is also political insofar as we believe that the 2011 budget cannot be disassociated from the more general financial context of the years to come and, in particular, from the perspective of the next 2014-2020 financial cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, if there is an objective that our Parliament must aim for in the course of this legislature, it is to ensure that European policies are funded in a manner commensurate with what is at stake. It is not necessarily a question of asking for more money but rather to ensure that the tasks assigned to the European Union can be achieved with adequate funding. Our States can even economise, reduce their contribution to the Community budget, if they are prepared for Europe to change its financial system, as it is now obsolete, and take advantage of own resources. A euro spent at European level is, indeed, more profitable, more productive than a euro spent at national level, because a European euro does not have a deficit to cover. At national level, the euro is now worth only half or less in some countries. At national level too, this euro which has not already been reduced comes back in the shape of cohesion funds, funds for rural development and for promoting innovation. I request that the Council gives serious consideration to this new approach to European finance. I am grateful to Commissioner Lewandowski for already having opened this debate with our ministers of finance. Europeans have the right to know what their public authorities spend, whether these be local, regional, national or European. Member States must be ready to lift this gauntlet. President of the Council, Ministers, you have in your own hands the key to unlocking these debates and negotiations so that all the Member States can move forward, so that the euro that is at the level of Brussels can return to the level of the citizens in the Member States and be much more productive and create new jobs at a European level. I beg you, the opportunity is still there. As a Christmas present, you must tell us that the own funds and own resources of Europe are starting to be the subject of serious discussion and serious negotiation under your Presidency. I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this.Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report sends a clear message: the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy. The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes. A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world. Culture is a significant asset. It contributes to a living and long-lasting democracy. Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society. Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union’s success for the Mediterranean. It leads nations to share and interact with one another, respect and better understand each other every day.

Mr President, the European Union has finally imposed sanctions on Syria. Unfortunately, however, it appears to have done so with some trepidation, taking care to avoid calling the head of the Syrian regime into question. This lack of determination and clarity is obviously interpreted by the demonstrators as a form of abandonment and by the authorities as an indulgence enabling them to step up their repression, a repression so cruel that it is unimaginable that Syria may be elected to sit on the UN’s Human Rights Council when the country’s authorities are right now refusing UN observers access to the city of Deraa, the scene of terrible violence against unarmed civilians. Having Syria on the Human Rights Council would be an insult to the victims and their families, and an encouragement for that regime to use brute force against its own people, with complete disregard for the values that the Human Rights Council is supposed to uphold. So, Baroness Ashton, what diplomatic options do you have in mind in order to avoid such a disaster? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I supported this resolution because I am convinced that the European Union’s desire to bolster its presence within international organisations is entirely legitimate. European citizens, through our governments, have given a legal personality and specific powers to the Union. European integration has built on a set of fundamental values that are constantly being extended. We have a duty to coordinate our activities and to promote the unity of our Union, as we have already done in the World Trade Organisation. More work remains to be done. However, there are some encouraging signs. The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools (appointment of a High Representative, creation of the European External Action Service). With its newly improved status, the Union will now be able to express its position within the United Nations General Assembly. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report provides a good overview of the current state of relations between the European Union and Iceland. Ever since the Treaty of Paris, we have maintained friendly, close and cooperative links with that country. It has been hard hit by the economic, financial and banking crisis. Reforms must be undertaken, and we must encourage them. Since the start of the accession process, we have begun an open and constructive dialogue with the Icelandic Government, which has also expressed a desire to join the euro area. Enlargement to include Iceland will allow for greater European policy coherence in the Arctic region, especially where fisheries, maritime transport, scientific research and environmental conservation are concerned. However, Europe is not a crutch or a cure for an economic crisis. It is up to Iceland to clearly subscribe to a genuine project of integration with the rest of Europe. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 We need to rethink our policy on the Southern Mediterranean. The European Neighbourhood Policy was supposed to promote the values of democracy and human rights, yet the events that have been taking place in the Southern Mediterranean since the start of the year show that we failed on that score. Admittedly, cooperation in areas such as education and modernisation of the economy has borne fruit. The same cannot be said of good governance, judicial reform and democracy, which are nonetheless headline objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This text has the merit of proposing solutions for radically rethinking this policy. I hope that the European Commission and the Council will be able to take inspiration from it.

The resolution on the situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen rightly denounces the brutal and murderous repression whose victims are the demonstrators in Syria, as well as those in Yemen and Bahrain. The leaders of these three countries are giving orders to fire on their own people, who are legitimately demanding political freedom, human dignity and social fairness. Through this resolution, the European Parliament is strongly expressing its solidarity with the Syrian, Bahraini and Yemeni citizens, who are showing great courage in demonstrating their aspirations while faced with government forces who are opening fire on unarmed civilians.

 I voted in favour of this text on migratory flows. Indeed, the events that our southern neighbours are currently going through are resulting in high levels of migration to European shores. Now more than ever, we have to coordinate our foreign and immigration policies. This is a truly European issue and now is not the time for national egoism. The Mediterranean countries of the European Union should not have to cope alone with the large influx of illegal migrants: this effort should be shared by all EU countries. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament’s clear position. We encourage the Commission to fight violence against women. Of course, there are preventive and repressive legal mechanisms in all the Member States. However, it is also the responsibility of Europe to take up this issue, which falls within its remit. It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis. Dominique Baudis,

 Mr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels, Mrs Brantner and Mrs Jäätteenmäki, with whom we prepared these amendments. Thanks to the amendments, we have a report that fully accounts for the events taking place in the Gulf, and which states very clearly Parliament’s position on the repression afflicting that region. The first amendment, 16th new citation, is as follows: ‘- having regard to the declarations by the High Representative of 10, 15 and 17 March, and the Council conclusions of 21 March on Bahrain and underlining in this context its full support for the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to peacefully demonstrate,’ This is the first amendment, and it is of course the English-language version, which has been distributed, that is deemed authentic. Dominique Baudis,  (PPE

The second amendment, recital A, is as follows: ‘Whereas current EU-GCC relations require constant reviewing and updating in view of recent important and rapidly unfolding developments on the ground, which are evolving rapidly, at the heart of which needs to be the pursuit of human rights and democracy.’ Dominique Baudis,  (PPE
) 
. – (FR)
 A new recital A bis: ‘A bis. Whereas demonstrators have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations in several GCC States; whereas the violent reaction of the authorities to the protests in Bahrain resulted in deaths, injuries and imprisonments; whereas Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti troops have arrived in the country under the banner of the GCC to participate in the repression of demonstrators,’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 In paragraph 7, after the first paragraph, the first indent should now read: ‘- ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, with special regard to the freedom of speech and of assembly and the right to demonstrate peacefully, and to listen to and take into account the legitimate demands of protesters as well as to ensure their security;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7a: ‘7a. Calls on all Member States in the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognise a continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region, and calls for the full engagement with emerging civil society groups to promote a process of genuine peaceful democratic transition, within their own countries, with partners in the region and with the full support of the European Union;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7b: ʻ7b. Expresses its deep concern at the violent response of and the use of force against protesters by Bahraini authorities and at the participation of foreign troops under the GCC banner in the repression of demonstrators; whereas this stands in stark contrast to the GCC’s support for the protection of the citizens demanding freedom and democracy in Libya; calls for an immediate end to violence against peaceful protesters and for a political dialogue that can lead to further necessary political reforms in the country;ʼ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 18a: ‘18a. Takes note of the declaration by the GCC of 7 March 2011 in Abu Dhabi, which states that “the Ministerial council demands that the Security Council takes the steps necessary to protect civilians, including a no-fly zone in Libya”, which declaration has contributed to the decision of the Arab League and then the United Nations Security Council to pronounce themselves in favour of such a zone;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it expresses the solidarity of the people of Europe with Japan. Parliament is highlighting the courage of the Japanese in this crisis, the most serious since the Second World War, which has so severely affected their country. Among Japan’s friends, Europeans have immediately reported themselves for duty to lend a helping hand to the people afflicted. However, the archipelago is faced with a nuclear problem that is of extreme concern and requires our full attention. It suits Europe to provide all its assistance and expertise to the Japanese authorities in order to prevent a catastrophe of the devastating consequences of which we are unfortunately all too well aware.

 Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for their collaboration. As you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Our work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world. Since then, we have observed everywhere – including in the Gulf – powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. However, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report – and the amendments adopted in committee – raised all the issues that are behind the uprising. We condemn all forms of discrimination – including those founded on gender or religion – we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights. As the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom. We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to take part in the repression, and we express our grave concern in respect of the violent response of those in power. Finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition. Obviously, this report also outlines long-term strategic prospects. It touches on the potential of a partnership in many areas (geopolitics, energy, education and science and in the area of regional integration). From a geopolitical point of view, Iran clearly represents a genuine threat. Between Iran and Israel, the Gulf States would inevitably be the collateral victims of a conflict. These countries expect a lot from us in trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The GCC countries, which make up a quarter of Arab League member states, play a very important role in the peace process. Let us remember that they are behind the Arab peace initiative. With regard to energy, the GCC is the European Union’s leading oil supplier, so the EU is highly dependent on these countries, but their oil reserves are dwindling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy. We can offer our experience in this area. On an educational and scientific level, these countries are making education one of their priorities. Because of the limited number of universities and lecturers, we are seeing units of prestigious American universities being set up. Unfortunately, the European Union, although committed, is very much lagging behind the United States. For example, only eight students from GCC countries came to Europe last year as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme. Finally, in the area of regional integration, the GCC is slow to make progress. Wiser for its experience, the European Union can offer its help, advice and know-how; finally, we call for the signing of a free trade agreement which has been in negotiation for over 20 years.

 I voted for this resolution, which is a step in the right direction as regards the reaction of the European Union to the revolution, which is degenerating into civil war, in Libya. Revolutions are a dream that becomes reality, but civil war is a nightmare. With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi’s troops and mercenaries, and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime, we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them. We have heard the appeal that the Interim Transitional National Council made on 5 March. It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime. With no direct military presence on Libyan soil, a no-fly zone should be considered. But the decision rests with the UN. However, this option could only be envisaged with the explicit consent of the Arab League. At a political and diplomatic level, we have to ensure that Colonel Gaddafi is isolated and help the Libyan people to finally regain their freedom. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The revolutions in the Arab world must not divert our attention from the Middle East peace process. On the contrary, they are an opportunity to be seized. Palestine is due to hold presidential and legislative elections before the summer, and the Palestinian Authority wants to establish legitimate institutions and manage its security. The ongoing construction of Israeli settlements is an injustice and a provocation to the Palestinians. Today, we have the opportunity, with this wind of freedom that is blowing over the whole of the Arab world, to relaunch the negotiations. The EU must take the initiative to relaunch them. Why not do so within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 With this vote, Parliament has reached another milestone on the road towards global financial regulation. We have sent a strong message in favour of the projects of the French Presidency of the G20. When the economy shows its first signs of recovery, we will have to work together to promote a well thought-out, balanced model of liberalism. The European left tried to take sole credit for the idea of taxing financial transactions. It was misguided, however. Europeans know when to be pragmatic. Today’s vote shows that this notion extends beyond all political differences. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which I believe is fair and balanced. The people of Egypt are seeing their legitimate expectations met. Mr Mubarak’s departure is an essential condition, but it is not enough to ensure that Egypt embarks on a path towards democracy and human rights. The transition is being overseen by the army, which has given itself six months to rise to this challenge. During the 18 days of demonstrations that led to this result, Egypt suffered financial losses, and they are becoming worse each day. The European Union must offer its support to Egypt so that the achievements of the revolution are not destroyed by a harsh economic and social crisis. So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results, and this has not done much for the EU’s image. However, our role remains crucial. We should not criticise ourselves unfairly. Revolutions are peculiar in that they always seem inevitable after the fact but impossible before it. However, self-criticism is justifiable, and we are on the right track, since the Council and the Commission have demonstrated their desire to radically rethink the European neighbourhood policy.

The sudden arrival of thousands of migrants on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is an exceptional event. However, this event brings us face to face with a problem which concerns all Europeans. Right now, it is important that European solidarity should function properly. I agree with you, Commissioner, in your appeal to the Member States to deliver urgent aid to Italy, both in terms of goods and in terms of finance. Very often, in these situations, the countries in which migrants arrive are not their final destinations. Reception centres are frequently outdated, and serious tensions sometimes arise in areas where migrants are received. We have already passed some significant milestones in the fight against illegal immigration and in regulating flows. However, in a Union where internal borders have practically disappeared, Europe must equip itself in the long term with the means to achieve its ambitions. It must create a genuine immigration policy, open a constructive dialogue with countries of origin and strengthen the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) in its missions.

 This motion for a resolution reaffirms Europeans’ commitment to the root-and-branch reforms sought by the people of Tunisia. Europe has maintained a special relationship with the people of Tunisia for a long time. It was the only international organisation to introduce clauses relating to respect for human rights and democratic values into its relations with Tunisia. European economic assistance, provided within the context of the neighbourhood policy, has helped to improve the average standard of living, to create employment, to train young people and to provide access for women to positions of responsibility. Europe is today anxious to support the people of Tunisia in the democratic transition that is beginning. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the situation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion, which condemns the deadly attacks against Christians in the East. The attacks against Christians in recent months are a tragedy for the many victims, particularly in Baghdad and Alexandria, but also for their co-religionists. Christians have lived in the East for 2 000 years; they are inscribed in the history of their country. Today, however, they are fleeing the region en masse. Because of this forced exile, these countries are losing a substantial proportion of their human resources. The Near and Middle East regions have always been an area of diversity and cohabitation of religious minorities. The terrorists behind these attacks are trying to instigate a clash between East and West, pitting the Muslim world against the Christian world. All of this has been fiendishly planned. Christians in Iraq and Egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed. It is important that the Egyptian and Iraqi authorities find and harshly judge the authors of these massacres.

 For the next six months, you will hold the Presidency of the Council, and many challenges await you. You are making the exit from the crisis your top priority. I am convinced that under your Presidency, the institutions and the Member States will continue to work well together. It is our duty to ensure the long-term survival of the solidarity and stabilisation mechanisms, which have already shown their worth. In order to achieve our aims, we will also have to focus on reforming the international financial system. We, in Europe, have been the forerunners of the regulation and supervision of the financial markets. The French Presidency of the G20 is an opportunity that must be grasped. A united Europe should set an example to its foreign partners. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a key instrument in the Union’s foreign policy. Thanks to it, we maintain stable relationships with our closest neighbours. The Eastern Partnership, which is one of your priorities, should not be promoted at the expense of the Mediterranean Partnership. The Union for the Mediterranean is losing momentum and is equally deserving of our attention. Europe remains its firm supporter. What do you intend to do to revive it? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The citizens’ initiative is finally to see the light of day. This incredible democratic innovation will lay the foundations for a new European citizenship. It will become the instrument which enables the European public to give direct expression to their concerns on subjects which may be crucial to our common future. The scope for intervention is as important as the extended mandate of the Union. The European Parliament is encouraging rapid, effective implementation. This initiative was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and it still remained to the European institutions to come to an agreement on practical arrangements. The conditions for organising an initiative, which Parliament wanted to be flexible (a million people from at least a quarter of the Member States, which equates to seven countries today), will give citizens concerned all they need to request the Commission to propose a new legislative text. This will become a possibility next year. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The European Union must grant itself a budget equal to its ambitions. It must not let itself be carried along by the crisis but rise to the challenges it meets. With the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now plays on a level playing field with the Council and has made its mark as a proactive force. I voted for the 2011 budget as it is incumbent on us, as MEPs, to give Europe clear political direction. In 2011 Europe will keep its priorities on target. It will be able to revise upwards its financial needs in order to implement its new powers. Despite difficult economic circumstances, Parliament has managed to win a firm commitment from the Member States. On the proposal of Parliament, in 2011 the Commission will begin discussions on the different types of own resources, resources which Europe needs to guarantee its financial autonomy in the future. However, I am deeply concerned that Parliament has not found a consensus on the additional funding that the ‘Iter’ project will need from 2012. The experimental thermonuclear reactor, a flagship project of international research and European scientific dynamism, could have benefited from an unused and surplus portion of the 2011 budget.

 Looking carefully at the images available on the Internet, one can measure the level of violence used against the Moroccan law enforcement authorities. The scenes witnessed at both the Gdaim Izyk camp and on the road to Laâyoune are evidence of the deadly acts of violence against the Moroccan security services. Not even the emergency vehicles were spared. The reality is very far removed from what the propaganda would have us believe. Our Parliament therefore needs to show restraint and use discretion rather than unduly laying the blame on the Moroccan authorities and holding them fully responsible for this situation.

The financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules. Having stated in September that it was determined to supervise the markets, the European Parliament has today, 11 November, sent another powerful message to the rest of the world. From now on, alternative investment funds (hedge funds) entering Europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by Europe. What is more, they will have to be declared to the authorities and managed within the European Union. The non-regulation of these resources caused many bankruptcies, stock exchange crashes and social crises. France is about to take over the G20 Presidency for a year. Its main priority will be to reform the international financial system. With this vote, Europe is blazing a trail. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The financial, economic and social crisis has now been raging for two years. It has resulted in an unemployment rate of more than 10% in the EU and in the risk of a new recession. This is a crisis that we are unable to bring under control. The next G20 summit will take place on 11 and 12 November in Seoul, under the Presidency of France. Establishing the G20 was the brainchild of President Sarkozy, who believes that nowadays, the global economy is no longer regulated by the 8, but by all the major developing countries, too. This framework allows for the development of an ambition grounded in a long-term vision. This crisis demands that we have genuine economic governance, rules restricting social dumping in developing countries, financial regulation, and a reform of the international monetary system. To achieve this, Europe must know how to speak with one strong and determined voice. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 By voting today, Thursday, 7 October 2010 on a resolution, the European Parliament is demanding that the Commission give thought to significantly improving cohesion policy instruments. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion is no longer just economic and social; it is also territorial. Regional policy is one of the spearheads of European integration. It is the second heading in the Union’s budget, after the common agricultural policy. Europe needs to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of its regions. The development of cross-border transport links is one of the major challenges of this policy. One of the priorities in this area is the route across the Pyrenees between France and Spain, which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West. At the moment, the road and rail links do not meet expectations. Some regions, although linked from a socio-economic point of view, do not today enjoy adequate means of communication. The various projects that the Commission is due to carry forward in this geographical area will be carried out in the medium and long terms. They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Cross-border cooperation is essential for our neighbouring countries. How is it possible to have a prosperous and sustainable economy if the borders are closed? It provides better border security and intelligent management of migratory flows. However, some of our neighbouring regions, such as the Maghreb, do not know how to work together. In the majority of cases where cross-border cooperation among our neighbours is at a standstill there is an unfinished conflict with a long history behind it. It is obviously crucial that we give our neighbours the resources to cooperate. However, in order for the budgets allocated to be really useful, we need the European Union, in other words, you, Mr Füle, and especially Baroness Ashton, to be present on the political stage. It needs to be in a position to have an influence, be heard and be respected. Otherwise the Union for the Mediterranean is doomed to failure. In addition, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument creates a multitude of documents and suffers as a result of its complexity or even opacity. Parliament has almost no right to see the strategy documents and national indicative programmes. We must be consulted more often and be better informed, and the procedure must be simplified.

With the new competences that it has acquired since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union needs to rely on strong diplomacy. The European External Action Service (EEAS) represents considerable progress in this respect. I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on the EEAS because, in order to succeed in her mission, the High Representative urgently needs to acquire a competent diplomatic arm. My decision is based on the conclusions of the Madrid Conference of 21 June, where an institutional balance was found. The European interest of the initial draft has been retained. The Commission, the Council and Parliament will now be able to work together to establish an effective and operational European diplomatic service. I am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the EEAS will respect this balance. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you will now hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union for six months. Numerous challenges await you, including the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), one of the major advances in the Treaty of Lisbon. The agreement reached between the various institutions envisages that the Service will be created by January 2011, even though it took more than seven months to negotiate its organisational structure. The actual and effective creation of the EEAS is now a matter of urgency, because the Treaty of Lisbon’s credibility is at stake, together with Europe’s image within the international community. Your experience of negotiating and reaching compromises will help in the actual implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. We wish you every success. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, this attack on civilian ships by Israeli commandos clearly demands an impartial and credible inquiry. However, what confidence can we have in a commission that would be the judge in its own case? This attack took place in international waters; it therefore concerns the international community and it affects Europe in particular, as Europe has a Mediterranean coastline. Europe should make itself heard more and should become more closely involved in the search for a political solution based on two states with each having Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is making significant financial efforts to help develop the Palestinian Territories, but, unfortunately, it is too absent from the political process which should lead to the creation of this Palestinian state. The financial and budgetary goodwill that we are showing is not enough. We must also express political will and give ourselves the means to make ourselves heard. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, in the follow-up to the Barcelona process, the Union for the Mediterranean is an opportunity to develop our relations with the countries to the east and south of the Mediterranean basin. As the excellent report by Vincent Peillon emphasises, we cannot neglect either the potential of this region or the risks which it brings with it. Let us at least have the presence of mind to recognise that, since the bombing of Gaza and with the continuing colonisation of Palestinian territories, the Union for the Mediterranean has been painted into a corner. The political aspect is blocked. We are not even sure if the planned summit in Barcelona in June will actually take place. I would not be surprised if we were to learn in the coming days or hours that it has been postponed indefinitely. However, we should not give up; the European Union should assume greater responsibility in the search for a political solution. We cannot allow the United States to monopolise political crisis management in this region, our region, and confine ourselves to its development. Our security and growth depend on the development and stability of the Mediterranean, which is why the Union for the Mediterranean is still the best instrument at our disposal. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid any caricatures – we have heard one or two this morning – I would like to mention some objective facts regarding Tunisia, a partner country of the European Union. The social situation has evolved very favourably, with a spectacular increase in the average per capita income, and now the vast majority of Tunisians meet the criteria defining membership of the middle class. More than 90% of Tunisians enjoy welfare cover, and more than a quarter of Tunisia’s budget is devoted to education, with the result that the country is one of the very first to have achieved the Millennium Development Goals in the area of primary education. Finally, as Mr Michel highlighted a little while ago, women’s rights are both recognised and guaranteed. At university level, female students outnumber male students, and 40% of teachers are women. A quarter of politicians, local officials and journalists are women. Many countries would be envious of these statistics. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, the acts of fanatic criminals, who have killed some Christians in Egypt, cannot be ascribed to an entire population and its government. It would be unfair to hold Egypt and the Egyptians responsible for this appalling massacre, for which the perpetrators will be brought to justice. We must not confuse the acts of one criminal with the policy of an entire country! Let us not tar fanatics and an entire population with the same brush. Finally, by seeking to intervene between the Coptic Christians and their fellow Muslim citizens, we are adding fuel to the fire of the extremists, who want to portray Eastern Christians as agents of the West.

During the last Foreign Affairs Council, the Council of the European Union made it known that it wanted a Palestinian state to be created in the near future, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is thus outlining the conditions of a viable solution to the Middle East conflict that is acceptable to both parties. The solution proposed by the Council is fair. Israel and Palestine can use it as a basis on which to exchange land for peace. The European Union has a major role to play. It can support inter-Palestinian reconciliation, without which there will be no Palestinian interlocutor in the negotiations with Israel. It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 Mr President, the SESAR programme, which aims to modernise air traffic management in Europe, is a major project. How is the Commission going to prepare for the forthcoming SESAR deployment phase and, in particular, for the financing of this programme, which is essential both for the environment and for our scientific and technical standing? Will the Commission follow the recommendations of the 2007 report, according to which a highly qualified individual should ensure political monitoring of this programme? Indeed, a number of obstacles will have to be overcome – of a legal, psychological and technical nature – to unite national airspaces and to succeed in getting controllers from the various countries to work together. If Europe is not able to create a single airspace, how will it be able to build a strong political union? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Following the negotiations at the European Council of 29 and 30 October and the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court of 3 November, the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, has signed the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty will now be able to enter into force, providing the institutions with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and with a stable President of the Council for two and a half years. The structure of the new Commission, like the choice of figures who will occupy the posts of President of the Council and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, are crucial. The choice of President of the Council is crucial since it is he or she who will embody Europe for two and a half years. Moreover, at a time of globalisation and of power struggles between continents, the choice of High Representative for Foreign Affairs is of undeniable strategic importance. On 19 November, an extraordinary European Council will meet to negotiate the nominations. We are at a turning point in European history. The choices that you make, Heads of State or Government, will determine the Europe that you want in the future. Therefore, be ambitious, because Europe must be dynamic, proactive, effective and political if we want it to continue to progress. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job-creating growth. That was the agenda of the G20 in Pittsburgh. On the other hand – and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference – it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption. In other words, we must restart the machine and ensure that that machine pollutes less. Moreover, these two issues cannot be resolved one after the other; they are both urgent. Relaunching economic activity is urgent, and limiting the consequences of economic activity is urgent. At the G20 yesterday, and at the climate-change conference tomorrow, the European Union must tread a narrow path between two equally formidable threats. The European institutions must be established as quickly as possible under the Treaty of Lisbon adopted by the 27 countries of the Union. By ‘playing for time’ to delay this moment, the Czech President, Mr Klaus, has a big responsibility towards the 500 million citizens of the Union. Jean-Marie Cavada,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this somewhat late hour the students are, I trust, sleeping, and it will not be long before their teachers are doing the same. We, however, are still up. Drawing as it does on the Commission’s last report on the European Schools’ system, our report aims to improve the European Schools concept, which must be adapted to the new economic requirements and the changes in society. This concept must remain a model of inspiration for national school systems, promoting European citizenship and encouraging increased mobility, as well as the learning of the languages of the Member States, the languages of the countries of Europe. These are the main points of this report: first, it contains a set of policy priorities to improve this educational model in Europe, in particular by establishing an appropriate legal basis for it, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The current legal status has reached its limits and requires a radical change to allow the Union to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the work of the Member States, without, of course, superseding their competence, and to adopt legally binding acts to that end pursuant to Articles 2 and 6 of the TFEU. I believe that Article 165 of the Treaty could be a perfectly appropriate legal basis. The European Schools must set an educational example by basing themselves on the dissemination of European culture, values, integration and languages. It is, therefore, essential for the Member States to cooperate when developing their national syllabuses, drawing on the simple example, which has worked wonderfully well up to now, of the teaching approach used by the European Schools. The opening of Type II and Type III Schools must be wholeheartedly encouraged. It is in this spirit that the report insists that holders of the European baccalaureate should be able, once and for all, to apply to any university in the EU, with the same rights as nationals of the country in question who hold equivalent qualifications, as it is essential that the baccalaureate is automatically recognised in all of the Union’s Member States. In this difficult period, I wished to stress the absolute need to rationalise the Schools’ management costs, without calling into question the fundamental principles on which the concept rests, especially mother-tongue teaching by native speakers, in order to maintain the quality of this teaching. Similarly, I believe it is essential to maintain equal and equivalent teaching conditions for the children of all language communities in the European Schools. It is, therefore, with a concern for fairness that the report highlights, in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, the plan to see general use of the working languages for teaching all non-fundamental subjects, without, of course, this being detrimental to those whose mother tongue is not one of the working languages. To ensure good governance of the European Schools, very serious attention must be paid to the lack of seconded staff. This must be compensated for by local recruitment of teachers, whose salaries should be paid by the Schools. The Board of Governors must, therefore, ensure that Member States that do not contribute financially by seconding teachers pay an equivalent financial contribution to the Schools’ budget. I wished to reaffirm moreover that, in these difficult times in particular, provision for students with special educational needs remains a priority, and I have asked the Board of Governors, in this regard, to ensure that coefficients are applied to this category of student when calculating class sizes in order to ensure their full integration. Finally, Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to repeat my call to the Board of Governors to work on providing alternatives that allow students who are unable to complete the course to find vocational courses. I would not wish to finish this presentation without thanking the Commission, my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs, and especially the parents’ associations, who have enabled us to reach a consensus on which to progress this issue. Forgive me for having stolen 45 seconds from you. Jean Marie Cavada  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this is such a serious matter that one must rise above the dreadful arguments that I have just heard in this House, because when we talk about the media we are talking about the health of a democracy. President-in-Office of the Council, I am one of those people who admire and feel affection for your country and for the Hungarian people. I fully understand that your government and some members of the public wanted information to be handled in a more balance way, and, objectively speaking, they were right. However, replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right. Consequently I am pleased this evening, but I am vigilant. I am pleased to see that your government has decided to return to several fundamental points and to change the December 2001 law on the media. This needed to be done and you did well to address this matter. I am also pleased that you are once more showing greater respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights which your people have always craved in the course of recent history. I would like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Kroes, and I support the composition of her group of monitoring experts. However, we will be vigilant, because we also feel that a number of points have not been dealt with, and we shall also pay attention to the details of the legislative amendments. In conclusion, I should like to tell you, President-in-Office of the Council, that you are the heirs to the fatherland of Liszt, of Kossuth, of the 1940 hero, Joël Brand, of Sándor Kopácsi and Colonel Maléter of 1956. You are the heirs of Sándor Márai. You are the heirs of Imre Kertész. So do not let us down! It was a Hungarian who invented the magical game that is Rubik’s cube. Do not teach us, in Europe, to play with the media in the style of a ‘Jobbik’s Cube’ because that is a dreadful game. Jean-Marie Cavada  (PPE

Presidents, we are very fearful of the future of banking. The economy has transferred its toxic debts to finance; finance has passed the buck to the Member States, and the Member States are now turning to the citizens, who will have to pay, if they are able to. Now, Mr Leterme, you know far better than I that Europe must now perform its historic duty; in other words, it must impose a Community approach on Europe’s national leaders in terms of common discipline, certainly, but also in terms of recovery and innovation. In this drama which is being played out before us, there is no longer any national way out of the global crisis. Many European leaders – your colleagues – are watching the popularity ratings. At the moment, Europe’s leaders must look at history before history itself submerges us in the chaos of populism. Belgium is a country that was always strong on European patriotism; whether it is in a good or a bad state is immaterial. It is the will, discipline and objectivity of its leaders that will save us.

 I voted for this resolution, since it strikes a good balance in condemning the serious acts of violence between Israel and Hamas. The cessation of rocket attacks is imperative and cannot be up for negotiation. Terror is not a policy and Hamas must understand that. Equally, however, while there can be no question that Israel is entitled to protect itself, Tzahal should be more measured in its retaliation. The blockade on the Gaza Strip has been going on for too long now. Tel-Aviv must loosen its grip on this narrow strip of land. Its actions are counter-productive from a security viewpoint and create an intolerable humanitarian situation for the Palestinians. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted in favour of this report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, as it makes a pertinent assessment of the Union’s record on the matter and of the challenges that we must prepare to tackle together. It is important not to allow Europe to enter a strategic decline. The European Union has the tools to pursue a truly ambitious policy in security and defence. As the report indicates, the European Union must preserve its military intervention capability, but also its capacity to intervene by civilian, economic, humanitarian and commercial means to deal with the new situations that are arising in the world, sometimes at the fringes of Europe. I believe that Parliament is making a clear appeal for Member States to make a stronger commitment to the Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the only way of maintaining the strategic weight of a Europe that has fallen prey to budgetary difficulties in a multipolar world.

 I voted in favour of these two texts on migration from the Schengen Information System (1+) to SIS II. Our first message is clear: this migration was decided on several years ago, it is very delayed and it is now time to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently in the all of the Member States. We therefore urge the Council to get this system up and running without any further delay. Moreover, the SIS is a vital component of the Schengen system and Europe’s internal structure for the fight against organised crime and for internal security. This second version will modernise this database and, above all, provide a central structure under the Community system. The migration and, more generally, the database are subject to one absolutely fundamental principle (which is reiterated in both texts): stringent rules on the protection of personal data.

 In the lively debate on shale gas in the European Union and its Member States, there is no absolute truth. There is clearly a halfway point between those who are pro shale gas and those who are anti it, and it is essential to take the heat out of the debate. It would be a major strategic error to renounce this energy source now without even continuing the research. Equally, however, allowing unbridled exploration when the technique is not yet fully developed would be environmental madness. Shale gas has undeniable potential and we need to look at it seriously. As things stand, however, shale gas exploration puts the environment at risk and it would be irresponsible to go down that path. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The International Convention on the Rights of the Child, the anniversary of which was the actual day of this vote, states that a child is not simply a fragile being in need of protection but a person with the right to be educated, cared for and protected regardless of the part of the world where he or she is born. On this International Children’s Rights Day, the European Parliament passed by a large majority a resolution on the protection of children in the digital world against the risks of violence, fraud, child pornography and sexual harassment which children may encounter on the internet. Our resolution strongly asks States to make additional efforts to combat illegal and harmful content on the internet, to minimise the risks of internet use for children, while insisting on the importance of educating children in the new digital media. At a time when internet surfing is becoming a habit for our children, we need to provide enhanced protection for them. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The crisis we have experienced since 2008 has shown up the cracks in the current architecture for economic and monetary union. Today we need to learn from the crisis and give the EU the frameworks it needs to ensure it remains economically and financially stable as well as prosperous. That is the very meaning of this report. By voting in favour I also wanted to support two demands relating to democracy and social issues, which I believe are essential to this next wave of integration. Firstly, I believe strengthening economic and monetary union can only happen alongside a guarantee of greater democracy, which requires the involvement of and supervision by the European Parliament and national parliaments. Secondly, in view of the serious social crisis facing several Member States, I particularly support the recommendation to introduce social and employment benchmarks alongside current fiscal and macroeconomic benchmarks.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 is to be the European Year of Citizens, the year of European citizenship, 20 years after the creation of European citizenship and, as has been said several times this evening, one year before the renewal of the European Parliament. It is therefore a very symbolic year, even a very serious year, particularly in the present context. In fact, the latest surveys show that, since autumn 2009, there has been a very worrying and very noticeable trend towards a serious and very substantial loss of confidence in Community actions and the Community acquis
, even, when it comes to rights and freedoms, within the European Union itself. Faced with this situation, the essential question has always been, and still is, the need to consolidate a European identity, to succeed in creating a common feeling of belonging, to make a real success of defining the shape of this European citizenship, a shape which will be applicable to all Europeans. There is no doubt that this objective which has been announced can be achieved in 2013, but only by means of more information, more dialogue, more meetings, more exchanges and more sharing. Although I am delighted with the excellent quality of the text, I wish that our institutions, when making their choices and decisions, would show enough determination to give themselves the means of achieving their objectives, and would thereby demonstrate a strong political willingness to practice what they preach. Moreover, though of course I am happy about the results obtained in the negotiations, in particular by Ms Papadopoulou, who showed great determination, especially regarding the broadening of the scope of this European Year of Citizens in the decision-making process, the European civil dialogue, etc., I have strong reservations about the ridiculous budget allocated to this European Year, the smallest ever given to a European Year. Since the task is so enormous, I am sorry that the Council and certain members of the Committee on Budgets have refused to grant resources for this Year, which is, without doubt, one of the most important and one which, in my opinion, should be regarded as the Union’s first priority, because without European citizens we have no Europe and we cannot integrate Europe.

 I voted firmly in favour of this report, which, once again, strongly condemns the inadmissible practices of ‘extraordinary rendition’, secret prisons and torture, and, above all, EU Member States’ complicity in these CIA ‘programmes’. We have been demanding, for years now, that Member States involved in such activities conduct thorough, impartial and independent inquiries into the failings and abuses which occurred, and demanding that the European Union bring its action in line with its values. In this new report, we restate these demands. More detailed enquiries must be carried out and responsibility must be determined. The adoption of this report is a new step towards remedying these inadmissible practices. However, much work still remains to be done in order to establish the truth and acknowledge all of the violations which were committed. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

By adopting this own-initiative report, we wanted to send a clear message – separately from the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the asylum package – that the Dublin II system, whose faults and limitations have become clear, needs to be reformed. Our message is twofold: it emphasises both responsibility and solidarity. This is because it is fundamentally necessary to increase solidarity among European states in the area of asylum, as has become clear following the recent migratory flows following the events in Tunisia, then in Libya and now in Syria. More than ever, Europe needs a genuine common European asylum system, and there is an urgent need to implement European directives on asylum in order to make our European asylum system credible and efficient.

 The European Union had to react to the Mediator scandal, which claimed hundreds of victims, due to a lack of effective alert and response mechanisms in the face of a harmful drug. I voted for this amendment to the European legislation on pharmacovigilance because I think it is moving in the right direction: that of transparency and control. I think that the three main measures it introduces are very important: the real reasons behind a company’s decision to withdraw a medicine in a country will be known, these medicines will be systematically subjected to an urgent assessment, which will reveal the levels of hazard, and finally, a symbol on the medicine’s packaging will inform patients and practitioners if the medicine has been subject to an additional safety study. Within the framework of the organisation of the market for medicine, in which the EU has some powers, these measures will help to ensure, at EU level, that a health crisis such as the one we saw with Mediator will never happen again.

 I felt it was important to vote in favour of this resolution, which reaffirms certain principles regarding the donation of tissues and cells. It is an ethical requirement. However, several Member States do not take it into consideration: donations of tissue and cells should be voluntary, unpaid and, without any exception, anonymous. These ethical failures in certain Member States are set in an environment of regular revelations of cases of trafficking in human products. The main reason for my vote is to send a message to the Member States that they must put a stop to this trafficking. The scope of this resolution goes beyond ethical questions and addresses the issues of public health and the fight against criminal activities. Moreover, this resolution encourages the creation of systems allowing for greater European and international cooperation, aimed at improving the management of the growing need for human tissues and cells for innovative treatments, a need that, in itself, constitutes a major challenge for public health.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate our two co-rapporteurs on their work. After intense negotiations, which were difficult but exceedingly well organised, they managed to come to an agreement with the EU Council that will allow minimum standards on the protection of victims to be introduced throughout the European Union, marking another stage in the creation of the area of freedom and justice at Community level. Given the current situation, it is rare in the Union to find so many reasons to be satisfied. This evening, we can all welcome the mechanism outlined in this text to protect victims, who form a legal category that, as you said, Commissioner, is often forgotten in our national legal systems. Justice for victims means protecting them, facilitating their access to justice, supporting them and giving them the right to legitimate compensation. It was therefore essential to have this coordinated, integrated approach that benefits victims. I welcome three points in particular. The first is the fact that the Council largely agreed to better protection for children. This text pays particular attention to children and their needs, and to their vulnerability as far as protection is concerned. That is covered by this text, and Article 22 in particular, which enshrines in full the principles and standards advocated by the Council of Europe, and the rights specific to children and their protection. Secondly, as you pointed out, Commissioner, we need to train practitioners and all those likely to come into contact with victims, including civil servants, lawyers, and those responsible for victim support: Article 24 emphasises the need for general and specialist training, which is a good concrete, realistic step forward at Community level. Finally, it is essential to develop the network of host structures to ensure that all victims can find someone nearby who will listen to and support them. This personalised aid is fundamental in the European Union because these victims are often alone and distraught because of these traumatic situations. Now, Commissioner, all that remains is to take the necessary measures to inform the public and raise awareness of this new mechanism. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted resolutely against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) because the Agreement contained too many uncertainties and posed too many serious risks to the fundamental rights of Europeans. The benefit of ACTA, however, was that it tackled some real challenges: protecting intellectual property rights against counterfeiting and piracy, and setting out some real issues for enterprises, creation and intellectual property rights in Europe and in the world, which are essential. However, the negotiations on the agreement did not reconcile these requirements with the protection of citizens’ individual freedoms and fundamental rights. The outcome of the vote could not have been any different. It is an historic vote because it is the first time that the European Parliament has rejected an international trade agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 After many months of negotiations, we have at last adopted the recast of the European railway legislation. Although it does not regulate everything, it nevertheless allows rail transport to be strengthened in the EU, particularly by clarifying the roles of the various actors in the rail transport sector. The flagship measures include strengthening the independence of the national regulators and establishing a European network of regulators in order for there to be a uniform interpretation and application of the legislation. Another vital aspect of this recast is the clarification of financial flows between the infrastructure manager and railway undertaking. This vote does not signal the end of the reform of the European railway market. Indeed, next year, the Commission should present new legislative proposals, particularly on the thorny issue of the liberalisation of national passenger transport and on the separation between the infrastructure management and transport operations.

 Better working conditions and greater compliance with legislation on driving and rest times for drivers in Europe: these are the reasons why I have decided to vote in favour of this text. It is also about creating greater transparency in an industry that is still very opaque. It is too easy to manipulate the tachographs currently in use and they do not provide the necessary guarantees to ensure that drivers’ driving and rest times are recorded efficiently in Europe. That is why it was crucial to adopt a text which lays the foundations for the use of new digital tachographs that will enable more effective checks which are also less restrictive for drivers.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution, which calls for the eCall system to be installed in all new cars by 2015. This is an important step forward for road safety as, were this technology to be introduced, it could enable a great number of lives to be saved on European roads. It is now up to the European Commission to come back to us with a legislative proposal. We in the European Parliament have expressed our view in the clearest possible manner.

 In accordance with European legislation, the Commission has a duty to translate European law and the related documents into all EU official languages to allow citizens, economic operators, NGOs and other interested parties to exercise their rights. However, in reality, many documents are only available in English. These include public consultations, even though they address citizens directly and are a fundamental component of drawing up transparent EU policies. Our resolution therefore urges the Commission to ensure that every EU citizen’s right to address the EU institutions in any of the EU official languages is fully respected and implemented. Respect for multilingualism is a principle, a right which is very important to me and we must defend it. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As Vice-Chair of the Tibet Intergroup, it is with much conviction that I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet. Our Parliament works tirelessly to protect the Tibetan people from the attacks and violence that they have been suffering for many years. In this sitting, we have adopted a new text which calls for the appointment of a special coordinator for respect for human rights in Tibet, which calls for constructive dialogue between China and the Central Tibetan Administration and which also calls on China to grant Tibetans their autonomy and to respect the fundamental rights (freedom of expression, freedom of belief, freedom of association, and so on) of the Tibetan people. Finally, the resolution strongly condemns the Chinese attitude towards Tibetans: the repression, prison sentences, and so on. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The PIP breast implants scandal has brought to light all of the shortcomings in the legislation on breast implants. For years, companies have been able to sell implants with defective gel to thousands of women worldwide without concern. In terms of public health, there should be no half measures. That is the message that I wanted to send by voting for this resolution, which proposes a strict framework so that such mistakes are not made again. We are clearly asking for more safety controls, but also, and above all, for greater traceability and a more restrictive marketing authorisation system. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I am pleased that the issue of the negotiations on the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) has finally been put on the work agenda of our European Parliament, particularly thanks to pressure from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to which I belong. By this, we hope that our Parliament is able to voice its opinion on this matter and that the European institutions adopt a strong common position to find a solution to the problems of arms transfers. Indeed, for the international community to sign a treaty of this nature sends a strong signal, insofar as it will establish common binding standards for the import, export and transfer of arms. This trade must urgently be regulated in view of the arms transfers that fuel conflicts, poverty and violations of the rights of individuals. We are calling for clear, binding provisions, which meet the highest international standards in accordance with international humanitarian law. This problem must urgently be tackled head on if we are to ensure lasting security and stability in the world. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Europe and its institutions are often depicted as being far removed from the citizens and their concerns and needs. Nonetheless, the European Union regularly steps in to assist ‘distressed areas’ or areas ‘experiencing difficulties’, especially through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This week, for example, Parliament has approved support amounting to EUR 1.6 million from the EGF for footwear workers in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain. The industry is currently being hit by highly aggressive competition from Asian countries and is faced with making numerous redundancies. I voted firmly in favour of adopting this report. Such assistance is both natural and essential: Europe is based on solidarity, so when one of its Member States is in difficulty, it is perfectly normal to come to its aid. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted for this report, which aims to strengthen and facilitate cross-border volunteering and to reduce the administrative, legal and linguistic barriers to volunteering. In this report, we call on Member States to set national targets for volunteering and to recognise the rights of volunteers, in particular, by establishing a European statute for volunteering. Our report also suggests introducing an online information portal on issues related to volunteering. 100 million European citizens are currently working in voluntary activities. Volunteering offers an incredible opportunity for exchange and learning, and cross-border volunteering offers great potential for education, employment and citizenship, to improve mutual understanding and help develop a stronger European identity. Volunteering is one way of living as an active European citizen and, being from the only French region that borders three other Member States, that is something close to my heart.

 The issue of equal pay for men and women has been on the political agenda for very many years now, but progress has been extremely slow. That is why I voted in favour of this text, which recommends, amongst other things, laying down stricter penalties for employers who practise pay discrimination of this nature. While I am not in favour of imposing penalties right, left and centre, it is true to say that certain employers today do not comply with rules which were laid down in the past. In 2012, it is no longer acceptable for women to earn around 17% less than men. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Once again, the European Parliament has voted in favour of this financial transaction tax with a large majority. I welcome this vote, which sends a strong signal to the markets and to those Member States still reluctant to impose such a tax. The high-risk behaviour of the financial markets contributed extensively to the crisis we are going through. It is absolutely crucial that they participate in the collective effort being made to get Europe out of this crisis and back on the road to growth. The European Parliament has expressed its view to that effect. It is now up to the Member States to do the same. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As the EU pursues its goal to build a European area of freedom, security and justice, it needs a strong internal security strategy. The own-initiative report that we have adopted by a very wide majority therefore stipulates, first and foremost, that this strategy and all measures that are taken must thoroughly satisfy the obligations placed on them in terms of fundamental rights and upholding the rule of law. Our report then goes on to stress that the strategy must be backed by sufficient financial resources in the next budget period, to allow the European Union to actually address these challenges, and to do so in a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent way. Lastly, our strategy sets out five key areas for action in which the EU provides added value, and for which we need greater European cooperation. I am delighted that this report has been adopted.

 I voted in favour of this report, which sets out a framework for the future development of an EU criminal policy. In the building of a European area of liberties and justice, the criminal sphere has always been treated somewhat separately since it is a rather sensitive area directly affecting regulatory powers. Yet, at the current time, it is difficult to imagine that criminal law should fall outside the scope of constructing a Europe based on laws. The communitisation of criminal law is a considerable challenge, but also a necessity in terms of large-scale crime and cross-border crime, and this is the issue addressed by this report. Moreover, I welcome the perspectives provided by such communitisation in Europe: firstly, ‘eurocrimes’, as well as the creation of a genuine European Public Prosecutor’s Office, whose remit must go well beyond the mere protection of the financial interests of the European Union.

 At a time when the crisis and the disparities between regions are being accentuated within the European Union, territorial cohesion must be at the heart of EU policies now more than ever. It is this basic principle that I wanted to reaffirm by voting for this report. Indeed, regional airports have a key role to play in the economic development of the most remote regions by attracting companies, in particular, and also by enabling the development of tourism. Furthermore, as we are currently discussing the review of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), it would be appropriate, in this debate, to grant regional airports an important place alongside other major European transport nodes. In my view, this seems essential in order to achieve an optimal network across the EU. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution accompanying discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament’s 2010 budget. While I support the general guidelines contained in this resolution, I strongly oppose two clearly anti-Strasbourg amendments (Amendments 6 and 15), which were tabled and incorporated into this resolution. The debate and the attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament resurface with increasing regularity, and I am very mindful of this. Although it was long a symbolic issue, today it has become a predominantly legal and political one. I remain firmly committed to this permanent fight to keep the seat of the European Parliament within our beautiful European capital. Moreover, I voted against Amendment 4, which wanted to abolish the LUX Prize. Awarded each year by the European Parliament, the LUX Prize rewards films that go to the heart of European public debate and illustrate the universality of European values, cultural diversity and the process of European integration.

 While three out of four Europeans use their mobile phone while travelling, many find horrendously high bills waiting for them when they get home. Competition in the mobile roaming sector within the EU is still weak, leading to very high prices for consumers. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached at first reading on a text which I am sure provides effective solutions for improving the situation in the mobile roaming market for European consumers. Firstly, separating the provision of mobile phone services on national territory from roaming services will improve competition, as consumers will be able to choose whether they wish to keep the same communications provider while travelling and benefit from more attractive pricing. Secondly, gradually capping the maximum allowed charges made when billing for voice, SMS and data services between now and 2014 will be hugely beneficial to consumers. Furthermore, consumers will benefit from numerous measures improving transparency, such as the provision of information on roaming tariffs outside the EU, information on accumulated consumption expressed in the unit or currency of billing, and the introduction of safeguard caps (EUR 50 by default).

Once again, pirates from the Horn of Africa are attacking cargo boats off their coasts. Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is not, therefore, in decline. There are increasing numbers of incidents and they are becoming more violent. At the same time, more than 190 sailors are still held hostage and poverty remains ever present in this region of the world. I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, which calls for a strengthening of military resources, and also for solutions to be found to address the root causes of piracy. It is obviously essential to step up military presence, but that must be accompanied by an increase in humanitarian aid. Let us not forget that piracy and violence in the Horn of Africa are nourished, first and foremost, by the extreme poverty that prevails in the region. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Mr President, after being there in July 2011, I was, of course, deeply affected, as we all were, by the stories, the journeys, the courage, the path taken by these men, these women, these children who were suffering, arriving every day in Italy on the island of Lampedusa, before being crammed into detention centres in terrible conditions, sometimes defying all humanity, violating all human dignity, a long way from the much coveted European dream. There are both questions being asked and long-term political effects. Some such questions are: following our visits, we have all denounced the lack of information and today, one year later, we are still lacking information. How are the recent arrivals being managed? How many people have arrived? In what conditions are they living today? How many have been transferred to other centres or to the continent and where are the programmes on the island itself? We would like to know how the Italian authorities have used the more than EUR 232 million given to them to enable them to respond to this difficult situation. However, there are also long-term political effects. Apart from the fact that the paradise shores of the Italian island will forever remain extremely famous – the island of hopes and dreams for the arrival of these many Mediterranean boat people – I regret that this crisis in Lampedusa has brought us where we are today. This migratory crisis has been caused by poor management with regard to the arrival of these immigrants, which has furthermore led us to a famous France-Italy episode, to Italy granting temporary residence permits for migrants, then to the closure of borders by France and by Mr Sarkozy, culminating in a dramatic result for Europe and European integration, to a debate, which is today highly politicised, on the Schengen area, and to a situation where Europeans no longer like Europe because of Schengen and where this is being reflected in the elections. A real policy is therefore needed … (The President cut off the speaker) Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, SWIFT, ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) and PNR (Passenger Name Records) are acronyms that we often hear and which are a source of concern to Europeans who do not really know what lies behind them. What is the reality hidden behind these names? Excessively generalised surveillance of passengers, and an agreement which means that if I take an aeroplane, the United States will know about my dietary tastes, my behaviour at the airport, aspects of my health, and so on. Without going over all the arguments that have been advanced this morning in a long but fascinating debate, I would like to remind you that, since 2007, we have been calling for guarantees, such as red lines, which would have allowed us to obtain an agreement from Parliament. Yet we do not have this at the moment, either in terms of reciprocity or in terms of proportionality, as our admirable colleague, Mr Watson, reminded us in relation to the position taken by the United States, and I would question the proposals of Mrs Foster, which claim that passenger name records do not involve all that much. If they do not involve all that much, then let us call for reciprocity from the United States. In this Chamber, some people are saying that this is the best that we could achieve, that we will not get any more, that we must ask the judges. It is unacceptable to abdicate our responsibilities in this way. It is up to us to create the conditions of balance, of European democracy, between the security of combating terrorism and the preservation of liberties. That is why I will vote against this agreement. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Madam President, although slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, there are still many children, and some women and men, who fall victim to human trafficking in Europe every day. We are talking about domestic slaves, prostitutes, beggars and clandestine workers who live through a genuine ordeal of physical violence, humiliation and, at every stage of this hell, anger. Moreover, in nearly 40% of cases this phenomenon involves children. Totally powerless, these people are taken away, held against their will, beaten, subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, and deprived of their rights. The Union and its Member States have a historic responsibility, as you have reminded us, Commissioner, and we must act together to face up to this criminal activity which flouts the whole spectrum of human rights, particularly those of women. Above all, though, it is of course up to the Union to protect children, the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society. In relation to this cooperation, Commissioner, although the directive does of course represent an advance and a step forward, it is your task to exert strict supervision of the Member States’ responsibilities through specific and tangible measures, so that we can eliminate this veritable cancer which contravenes the foundations of our democratic societies and the values that have been cemented by European integration. What will you do in relation to the Member States’ obligation to transpose the directive? The second question is: what news is there of the information and awareness campaign? Finally, what about the collection of information relating to trafficking in human beings, and what actions could be taken precisely on the basis of this data collection? Nathalie Griesbeck,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have spoken about challenge. While it is true that Greece is facing an enormous challenge, we need, above all, to respond to a challenge facing the European Union: its image in the world, and how the citizens see it. One would have thought that the end of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin wall, would lead us to believe that we would never again see the construction of other walls anywhere in Europe. Yet this is not at all the case. There is an enormous project, devised by Greece, to try to resolve to its huge problems caused by the arrival – as our Greek colleague said – of more than 300 people a day at its borders through a transit country, Turkey, and these are citizens who do not come from Turkey but from many other countries around the world. One would have thought that such a thing would never be seen again. What is more, this phenomenon is accompanied by an utterly disgraceful humanitarian situation, which violates the human rights we are constantly developing, protecting, defending and safeguarding as the most precious gift that the European Union has given to its citizens. The solutions to the problems are, needless to say, difficult, and the messages are complex. Without getting into the technical side of things, it is of course quite clear that solidarity – as Cecilia Malmström has just explained, through the idea of shared responsibility, through technical mechanisms, the funding that must be used, the earmarking of EU funds – should make it possible to provide effective aid and to address the situation in which these people find themselves with dignity and in a manner that is consistent with human rights. The second message, which has often been heard in recent weeks in Europe, is to up the stakes in the construction of texts and a rule of law system conveying the solidarity of the Member States towards Greece, which is coming under pressure along its borders. To ‘up the stakes’ means to construct a veritable arsenal of texts applicable by all and not to miss the point either, like when in my country, France, we talk about re-erecting internal borders when what we should be doing is protecting external borders – in a spirit of humanism, it should be remembered. Finally, Madam President, the third reply, or the third message underlying our proposals, is to have the possibility and the political will to achieve a balance between the north and the south and to use development aid and partnerships with southern countries so that migrants have no desire to come to an El Dorado that does not exist.

Madam President, I of course fully appreciate that Greece cannot deal with the situation alone. That is what I was trying to explain. I had the opportunity to visit the island of Samos in Greece where I saw the very difficult situation at first hand, and I also visited the island of Lampedusa, where I saw just how complicated the problems were. It is by acting together in solidarity, supporting Greece, a Member of the European Union, as much as possible, that we will be able to respond. However, for these responses to be substantive, they must be taken into account across all EU policies. I of course recognise the difficulty facing Greece. It is as if I were Greek.

 I voted for this report, which makes two noteworthy improvements to the coordination of social security systems within the European Union. The first is the clarification concerning access to unemployment benefits, enabling self-employed frontier workers to receive unemployment benefits in the country in which they have been working if they are resident in another Member State where there is no unemployment benefit system. The second is the introduction of the ‘home base’ concept for aircrew members (pilots, air hostesses, etc.), which will put an end to the social dumping that low-cost airlines practise against their personnel and thus guarantee fair social security for all aircrew personnel. As a native of a very ‘cross-border’ region, I fully support any initiative that strengthens the mobility of European citizens within the European Union, so that they can travel, move and work throughout the EU without administrative barriers.

Given their situation, their characteristics, their geographical distance, the structural weaknesses of their economies and their dependence on the outside world, etc., the outermost regions (ORs) of the European Union should be granted special treatment under the European Union’s cohesion policy, so that their unique features are adequately considered and protected. At a time when we are negotiating the new EU budget programming with the EU institutions, our Parliament has strongly objected to the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for ORs by nearly half, pointing out that these regions should receive special treatment. In this resolution, which I supported, we also insist that the specific characteristics of the ORs are taken into account in all European Union policies: fisheries and maritime policy, transport, the environment, etc. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Cancelled flights, lost baggage, delays, overbooking, etc. are all dysfunctions that are currently poorly addressed by the regulations in force. What was needed, therefore, was a new framework and new instruments to guarantee air passengers’ rights in all circumstances. That has now been achieved through this resolution, which, above all, provides greater transparency both in the information given when flights are delayed or cancelled and also in the prices that airlines advertise. Together with this need for transparency, there was also a need to improve the assistance given to passengers. Accordingly, this resolution states that passengers in difficulty should be able to talk directly to contact personnel who can provide immediate solutions and answers. In addition, the report considers that, if luggage is delayed by more than six hours, compensation should be offered that is proportionate to passengers’ needs so that they have the items they need while waiting for their luggage to arrive. Lastly, the resolution stresses that persons with reduced mobility should be given easier access to aircraft. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

In the negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in securing a number of key points: the explicit reference to regional protection programmes, especially the visibility of North Africa, the addition of ‘survivors of violence and/or torture’ to the vulnerable persons category and a reference to refugees from Iraq. I therefore voted in favour of this agreement at second reading. In addition, the negotiations on this text, aimed at amending the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund in the light of the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme, have been going on for nearly two years. We cannot allow this situation to continue when there are thousands of refugees who could benefit from this programme. Indeed, resettlement is the only viable and safe solution as these people are often in an extremely vulnerable situation. The European Union must step up its resettlement efforts in order to protect refugees and maximise the impact of resettlement by focusing, where possible, on those most in need, in accordance with the common priorities established at EU level.

 I voted against the Vaughan report on the draft budget for the European Parliament for the financial year 2013. I do fully support the measures and guidelines contained in this report, such as freezing our Parliament’s budget in real terms, freezing Members’ allowances, the cuts made in the budget relating to travel, the various savings that have been made, etc. However, this report contains three provisions/paragraphs that are clearly anti-Strasbourg. That is why I voted against it. The debate and attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament are coming up more and more often and I am very aware of that. Of course, for a long time, it was a question of symbolism; but today, and above all, it is a legal and political matter. I remain firmly committed to this ongoing fight to keep the European Parliament’s seat in our beautiful European capital. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The report that we have adopted by a very large majority this week aims to list the obstacles to European citizenship that still exist and persist (with regard to free movement, recognition of qualifications and non-discrimination, for example) and to firmly ask Member States to remove these difficulties. Beyond that, citizenship should be the European Union’s number one priority as, without European citizens, there would be no Europe and we could not construct Europe, especially in the context of the economic crisis, the crisis of values that we are facing today. There is currently only a slight sense of European citizenship. Yet, this lack of ‘European sentiment’, this lack of involvement from citizens in the European Union and the EU’s lack of transparency for European citizens are Europe’s greatest flaws. What European citizens are missing is the feeling of belonging to a European community and this is vital for the European Union. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 This week, our Parliament approved the setting up of a special parliamentary committee on organised crime, corruption and money laundering and I welcome it. I am convinced that this committee will provide an effective tool in analysing and evaluating these complex transnational phenomena, in preventing them and, most particularly, in combating them. This committee will be able to establish contacts, make visits, hold hearings, act with civil society and grassroots actors who are fighting on a daily basis against these scourges and, consequently, will be able to recommend measures to enable the European Union to combat these threats.

 Language difficulties, lack of understanding of neighbouring judicial systems, infrequent contacts and exchanges between institutions: these are all obstacles to the construction of a European judicial area. The challenges of judicial training at the level of the European Union are therefore considerable as there can be no construction of a European judicial area if we do not provide appropriate training for those who are the actors within it. Therefore, we must really take this issue in hand and make considerable efforts in relation to judicial training, not only of judges, but also of all other legal practitioners: lawyers, notaries, ombudsmen … in other words, all legal practitioners. There is a clear need today to build a European judicial culture and to do everything in our power to achieve this. We must promote contacts, exchanges and, in particular, I would like to point out the importance of setting up a genuine ‘Erasmus for judges’. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The European Union is the world’s principal consumer of chocolate, 70% of global cocoa production is cultivated in West Africa and approximately 18 million children throughout the world are estimated to work on cocoa plantations. The European Union cannot turn a blind eye to this utterly unacceptable situation which is dreadful in human terms. These children work in extremely dangerous conditions, they are frequently exposed to pesticides, and many are victims of human trafficking. I therefore strongly voted in favour of the annex to this resolution, which follows Parliament’s consent to the renewal of the International Cocoa Agreement in terms of production and commerce. This resolution is aimed at focusing on the issue of child labour in cocoa plantations and, in particular, it strongly condemns the use of child labour (and unacceptable types of work) in the growing and harvesting of cocoa beans.

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on addressing the European Union’s diabetes epidemic, which calls on the Commission to develop and implement a targeted European strategy on diabetes prevention, diagnosis, education and research, and calls on the Member States to implement national diabetes programmes, focusing on prevention. Diabetes affects almost 10% of Europe’s population and this figure is expected to increase by 16.6% by 2030. It is therefore necessary for the EU to adopt a European strategy to complement the national efforts in order to provide ongoing financial support for research and encourage early diagnosis of the disease.Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, José Manuel, I do not know if I should make a speech: I fully support yours! I do not need to repeat it but I will just echo a few comments that you made and look at them in more detail, although I feel that you covered everything. The only thing that has not been said is that with EUR 1.1 billion or EUR 1.13 billion, the budget that we have today, we can continue our policies; but below EUR 1 billion, we cannot do anything. I think that the Commission and Parliament have to stand firm in relation to what is happening now in the Council. As you said, on the one hand, there are those who want a long-term budget that can meet the challenges ahead: because the European budget is an investment budget and not a budget of expenditure; because we need it to relaunch growth and job creation and, in my opinion, no Head of State or Government is opposed to that. Then there are those who want a reduced budget to make short-term savings. In these conditions, do we really need a summit this afternoon? We need to meet to discuss, but not to reduce, the budget. The European Parliament’s position is clear, however; this position is now that of the majority in Europe and 517 Members of this Parliament voted for a multiannual financial framework (MFF) that is realistic and meets our ambitions. Sixteen Heads of Government are following this line and they met last week, as you said. If I were to give them one piece of advice, I would say: ‘be united at the Council and stand firm when it comes to defending our common budget’. At the risk of repeating myself, those who see only a free trade area and a single market in Europe are lying to themselves and they are lying to their citizens. The European Union is, above all, a Community of values, including that of solidarity. Did you know that, through the European Stability Mechanism, the Estonians and the Slovakians are helping to fund pensions in Greece, which are even higher than their own? I wanted to highlight this – and it is not said often enough – because these countries believe in the added value of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, my group is convinced that the European Union needs a sound, solid, responsible budget because, with the crisis, it is the only way for certain Member States to make investments. In the Baltic countries, for example, a Prime Minister told me last week that without funding from Europe, railway lines will continue to be connected to Moscow, and not to Europe. That is not what European integration means. However, like us, the Baltic countries need these connections to Europe. To achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we will need more than a trillion euros worth of investment in infrastructure networks. Yes, most of these investments will be private, but without European support, without cofinancing on our part, these projects will not see the light of day because of a lack of start-up capital. Let us take another example: we decided to invest nearly EUR 270 billion so that all European households and all our businesses benefit from broadband between now and 2020. However, if we had waited for private investment alone to achieve this, we would only have reached EUR 50 billion. That would mean no broadband for Europe as we would be EUR 220 billion short. These investments are necessary for our businesses, however. They create jobs, they stimulate the economy, and they contribute to our competitiveness. The only way to get out of this economic crisis is to develop through investment. Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. Either we learn the lessons of these last 60 years and we work together to relaunch Europe around peace, solidarity and competitiveness, or we trap ourselves in selfish, nationalist positions and founder together.  The 16 Member States plus Croatia who met last week in the European Parliament demonstrated that there is a core of Member States who want to move forward together. We, in the European Parliament, are going to defend our position on the budget. We will defend the European aid programme for the poor, which you mentioned. The proposal to reduce this programme by EUR 400 million is unacceptable. We will not allow this programme to be touched, even if we have to make an effort on all the other budget lines. It is out of the question to sacrifice aid to our poorest citizens, especially since their number will grow with the crisis. We have to fulfil this responsibility in order to support the NGOs that look after these people voluntarily. Removing this funding from the budget is not really a sign of solidarity; it is exactly the opposite. I am counting on this Parliament: we must not allow this position to be attacked. We will defend the Europe in which we believe: not a sum of countries that pick and choose from the menu of common policies, but a real union of 27 that is united, responsible and prosperous. We are at a crossroads. It is our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand firm if things do not move in the right direction, and it is also our duty to go beyond the selfish, national positions in our various countries to pave the way for the Europe of the future.

Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am, by nature, an optimistic person. My optimism is realistic, however. It is based on concrete elements, on facts and accomplishments, and on experience of everything we have achieved in the past 60 years, which, in the end, is just a start. The Nobel Prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of what we have built together over 60 years. However, it is also encouragement to go further, and I believe in Europe. I believe in the Community method. I believe in the added value that the European Union offers through its common policies. I also believe, however, in the European investment that allows our budget to inject some EUR 100 billion into our economies every year, and it is by no means enough. Europe needs these ambitious policies, policies that are going to help us to restore growth, but to implement them, we need an ambitious budget. I think that the debate here has clearly demonstrated that. I therefore appeal to everyone to face up to their responsibilities. We need a financial framework that matches our ambitions and, above all, we need an agreement at the end of the year if we want to appear credible to the outside world, Mr President. Last week’s European Council took a further step towards achieving our economic union. Our crisis is an economic crisis, but our mistake has been to fail to meet our commitments and comply with the rules that we set ourselves. In recent months, we have faced up to our responsibilities here, in this Parliament, and we have introduced the necessary instruments. The ‘economic governance’ package now has force of law but it has to be applied. The same goes for the ‘two-pack’ that we are discussing today. I think that we are going to conclude that very soon. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the lessons of this crisis is that we cannot exclude certain sectors, such as the banking sector, from our common laws. My group is aware of that, which is why we support the Council’s proposal to establish a European bank supervisor. In our economy, everything is connected. The slightest failure, the collapse of a single bank, affects the entire system. The banks may think that they are too big to fail, but no bank is too small to be supervised. We are convinced of this: our citizens, our businesses and the banks themselves need to have confidence in our financial system. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will make every effort to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from this crisis and that our European Union is reinforced because we believe that Europe is the solution. For some 20 years, the single market has been our success, but for that success to last, we must complete it and finish our work. We must force the Heads of State or Government to quickly fill in the gaps in the single market. I am thinking, in particular, about the establishment of the digital single market. If we do not do this, we will lose a turnover of EUR 1 billion every year. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroads. Some people want to do away with some of the European Union’s competences and reduce Europe to an economic free trade area. Europe is much more than that, however. Since the signature of the Treaty of Rome by our founding fathers, the European project has been synonymous with peace and prosperity. That has now been rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize. For 60 years, Europe has set an example in the world. Our role tomorrow is to strengthen the social market economy, increase our solidarity, continue to defend human rights and, above all, spread our values throughout Europe and beyond. President-in-Office of the Council, as I have said often here in this House, in times of crisis we need to take decisions. When we take decisions, it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes, but the worst thing to do in a crisis is to wait for too long. If we wait for too long, we will eventually cost our fellow citizens billions of euros. That is my appeal to you, and I hope that we will see a very good European budget before the end of the year. That will be proof of our commitment for the outside world and the markets. I wish you the very best of luck; I hope that you have the determination to reach your goal and bring us a nice Christmas present at our December part-session. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank José Manuel Barroso for his address, his speech, his analysis and his realism. We are back after summer break and, as is the case each year, we have two things to do: take stock of the past twelve months and discuss the future of the European Union. I think we are heading in the right direction now. What I mean is that we need to continue along the road towards greater European integration We also need more specific reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking about the crisis for three years now. We know that we were living beyond our means for too long, we know that we need greater discipline and a return to balanced budgets. Only then will we be able to invest in our future generations. We know the ways out of the crisis. In economic terms, what we have done over the last three years, we have done too slowly, and that has cost us billions. As for the economic governance package, the Euro Plus Pact, the European Semester, the Single Market Act, and in some sectors, for example, the banks, the need for European solutions is evident. Banks are no longer national, but transnational. A failing bank can bring down the entire banking system. This is why my group supports your proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism in the banking sector. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that our solutions are positive and we have examples to back this up. Although, I have not written it down on my sheet here, you have made me realise that there are also some positive examples. I think that the governments that have made the most reforms in Europe also belong to our political family. I am thinking about our friend Mr Dombrovskis. Although his is a small country deep in crisis, he got it out of crisis and there is now meaningful growth. Here too, as I see it, is an example, and he did it without having to rely too much on European solidarity. In his speeches, he stressed that in this deep crisis the only money he had to invest, was money he received from the EU budget. I think this needs to be given some thought because, unlike some, we realised how serious the situation was. We know that our economies are in bad shape and that the only way to get them better is a complete cure. To kick start this, we need a change of habits. We need large-scale rather than small-scale reforms. Yes, it is hard, but what choice do we have? For these reforms to succeed, we must also promote competitiveness and growth. My group supports those governments that are going down this route. I would also like to make another point. European solidarity should not be confused with charity. That is why I support the European Central Bank’s proposal to buy bonds because any State that benefits from this solidarity must act responsibly. Without a programme of reforms offering credible proposals, a State cannot receive this aid. This is the right approach. It is a European approach and, by bolstering States in difficulty, it is Europe, as a whole, that we are strengthening. Ladies and gentlemen, I will say it again, 20 years after it was introduced, we have still not completed the single market. Mr Barroso, I am appealing to you again. We must, as a matter of urgency, develop an action plan with precise deadlines to finish the job we started. The rules on the single market should be simple, consistently applied and implemented as a single package. For example, because of red tape, 23 million European SMEs still have no access to all 27 markets. Let me tell you that one job created in each of these 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises – if you tot it up - is a significant number. That is why my group has called for a reduction in red tape by 2015. At least 50% less paper: think of the trees saved for the environment. By doing this, we are giving European companies the chance to create jobs. The Commission must play a full part and have no hesitation in enforcing the law. Publish lists of States that have still not implemented the directives and force them to do so. Use your powers! Governments are frequently challenging us Europeans. Everything is always our fault. Let them, then, take some responsibility too. I call on you, Mr President, to define new, concrete fields in which the European institutions should intervene. I am convinced that there is a very simple remedy for the current crisis: it is more Europe, yet more Europe and more Europe again. What we need is fiscal and social harmonisation. Our joint actions and policies are successful. Let me give you one example that will surely surprise you: agricultural policy. This truly is a joint policy which has ensured food security – as you mentioned – during periods of significant fluctuations. It has also got entire regions out of poverty. This policy must remain European. Above all, we must not do what many are now calling for and renationalise it. That would be a disaster. This is a European policy that been successful and must remain European. To take another example, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment. No country can solve this problem on its own. Even if this comes under national jurisdiction, again, it is time to find a European solution. Again, I am thinking about this extra job in each of the 23 million SMEs. It might make you all smile, but not me: twenty-three million extra jobs with a European policy for youth employment; that should make you think. Ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Mr President, we are in the throes of an unprecedented storm. There are those in Europe and elsewhere, who would be only too pleased to see the euro collapse. Personally, I do not want to give them that pleasure and nor do you, José Manuel. Besides, why do the credit rating agencies prefer to attack the euro, rather than judge the country they know best where their head office is? They are not making the same analyses. I know why but, all the same, it is not right. We must face this storm, not by plastering up the cracks, but by strengthening our foundations. We must not repeat past mistakes. Creating an economic union without an accompanying political union is inconceivable. Our credibility is at stake. Mr President, let us show some European ambition. Europe makes decisions that affect 500 million Europeans. These decisions should be taken under democratic control, by the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage. The place of democratic legitimacy is here in Parliament, and I thank President Schulz for having refocused matters. We are elected democratically. I therefore think we should be recognised democratically. The so-called ‘four presidents’’ proposal aiming at real economic and monetary union is ambitious but it needs to be more so and Parliament should also be involved in this. Concentrating only on economic reforms is the wrong way to go because the economic crisis has become a political crisis, a crisis of confidence – as you rightly pointed out at the end. Now, I agree on a Treaty change in the medium and long term, but this is not the solution we need in the immediate future. Because I am French, all we need is for some Rules of Procedure to be applied to fiscal and social policies, and to be included in the Treaty when we have time to think. Now is the time for action. The latest Eurobarometer struck me. It reveals that a majority of Europeans think that Europe is indeed a good thing. But in many Member States, more and more of our citizens do not feel European. It is our duty - as you said - to explain the added value, but it is also the duty of all national leaders. For me, a good, responsible politician is like a good doctor. Both have to explain things, both have to tell the truth, both have to convince you, even if you do not want to hear it. We need to discuss the next steps of our integration with this reality in mind. Ladies and gentlemen, I am calling for more Europe, not more power for the sake of having power. We must build a Europe that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. This is why we want the 2014-2020 EU budget to have a credible, solid and ambitious framework, as it has been prepared by the Commission and Parliament. Here too, the Heads of State or Government are being held to political account and it will show our citizens whether or not we want more Europe. The European budget is not a budget of spending, but a budget of investing. It is a forward-looking budget, a budget for growth. Let us be serious and ambitious. I call on all those responsible to find a solution before the end of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, judges will today rule on the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Here in Parliament, we champion democratic control at European level. We also need to have the courage to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg when we think that our rights are not being respected. We must go before the Court frequently, as others do, and I am sure that will also strengthen Parliament. This is also why we need a real political Europe. A Europe where Parliament is the only direct representative of the citizens of Europe. If we do not do this, we will fail. Political union is legitimacy, it is more democratic control, more citizen participation. This is the Europe that I believe in. These are the values that our group supports. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Cyprus is taking over the Council presidency at a decisive moment for Europe. I said here, only yesterday in fact, that the European Council has held 30 meetings on the economic crisis and it is not over yet. Thirty meetings and only last week did we see the start of an action plan. That is why I am calling this morning on the new Presidency to show courage and determination. I hope that this Presidency will convince its 26 partners to opt for an integrated Europe, a political Europe and, at last, a united and therefore sovereign Europe. The economic crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge relates to the competitiveness of our economy and to unemployment, which is breaking records with an average rate of 11%. The opportunity is to do what the countries in the euro area should have done at the outset, in other words implement a common economic policy, a policy of balanced budgets and, above all, a long-term investment policy. President Christofias, although you and I are from radically opposed political parties, my group supports the priorities of your Presidency. In particular, I heard you use an expression that is very important to me: the Community method. In that respect, I know that I can count on you. Like you, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants the European Union to be more effective, more relevant and more efficient and to experience renewed growth. On that basis, we need to act. We need to take advantage of the 20th anniversary of the single market in the autumn to complete, at last, the work that began under Jacques Delors and implement the Single Market Act as quickly as possible. We need to apply the Services Directive in full. We need to create a genuine digital single market. We also need to reduce the burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. All of these measures will create growth and will thus create jobs. These are the measures that I am asking you, Mr President, to take along with this Parliament and in close cooperation with the Commission. There is another key aspect of your Presidency: the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. My group truly hopes that progress is made in this regard during the next six months, in the knowledge that the European budget is an investment budget, a growth budget and an employment budget. We need investment in all 27 Member States in infrastructure, investment in all 27 Member States in energy networks and in education, research and innovation, cohesion policies and food security; you spoke about food aid for the most deprived, I believe, and you also have my support in that regard. That is a credible and tangible response to the crisis, too. The Cypriot Presidency will find in the European Parliament an active and committed participant when it comes to the financial perspective, as long as the proposed budget is large enough and tailored to our needs. We will be keeping an eye on that, but we will help you to reach the end of the year with a Christmas package for this budget for the multiannual financial framework. Now, Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen – do not laugh, Mr Barroso, the package will be good, you will see – I would like to talk about another issue before you here this morning and that is the worrying political situation that has prevailed for a number of days in one of our Member States, Romania. Yesterday the Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, expressed grave concern. I quote: ‘I am seriously concerned about recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania. For me, a well-functioning, independent judicial system is a precondition for mutual trust in the European area of justice’. My group shares the Commission’s concerns and last week I, myself, expressed my concerns about the current state of democracy in Romania. This morning, I ask the Commission very sincerely to continue to monitor this issue as it has monitored others, in spite of the summer break. It is important for us to make progress over the next six months on various issues that are on the table and, President Christofias, we are counting on you. There are a lot of good things that you can do. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the thirtieth European Council dedicated to the crisis. Although, in comparison to previous meetings, we are closer to reaching the desired solution, the road map towards European political integration is still not forthcoming. Of course, this time, substantial progress has been achieved. Following the country-specific economic recommendations proposed by the Commission, the document presented by Mr Van Rompuy is a step in the right direction, as it finally refers to political Europe as the ultimate aim. He mentions a preparation period spread over 10 years. Yet, each of us knows that Europe will not survive between now and 2022 without budgetary, fiscal and social integration. I often wonder what political development the Twenty-Seven will judge sufficiently serious in order to consent to shared sovereignty. I wonder what graver problems are necessary, other than unemployment, the difficulties experienced by our companies, the prohibitive interest rates that our Member States must pay, in order to prove that a single currency must include a common economic policy. Having said that, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is satisfied with the advances contained in the Growth and Employment Pact, even though this contains some of the long-standing proposals already put forward by this Parliament and the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you must continue, together with Parliament, to put whatever is needed on the table, because when the Heads of State or Government come together, they are unable to find a solution. For each of them, it is a question of survival in their own countries. Therefore, we need Parliament, together with the Commission and Mr Van Rompuy, to come forward with, and put on the table, concrete proposals so that when governments find themselves strangled by the markets and suchlike, they may have a solution, as was the case with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’. My group supports the system of banking supervision, the proposal for a European guarantee and the European banking union project. Our fellow citizens must know that their savings are protected at all levels and that the instruments used to guarantee them are going in the right direction. Here too, we must strengthen protection. We need to guarantee the savings deposits of people who have worked all their lives, and you know we have problems with this issue at the moment. What now remains is the implementation of the instruments. That is why I again call upon the Commission, the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure this happens. The PPE Group also supports the EUR 10 billion increase in capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Indeed, we must ensure that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can finance their projects, keep their employees, in the first instance and, above all, be able to hire new staff. Although the provisions on the single market remain insufficient, project bonds, which were decided upon last Friday, are a step in the right direction. I welcome this move, insofar as it does not consist of supplementary funds that no longer exist, but rather better use of existing European funds. I would like to highlight here that last month, the Latvian Prime Minister once again came to speak to our group in order to tell us that, faced with the imperative of budgetary cuts that were being forced upon him, he has only been able to restart his country’s economy thanks to European funds. This is an example that must be repeated. The Latvian Prime Minister did it and he informed his citizens. Thanks to European solidarity, combined with the courage of its leaders, this country has restored growth and employment. Just because it is a small country does not mean that we cannot emulate this example. We do not talk enough about these amazing examples for Europe. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we see that the solution to the majority of our problems lies in having more Europe. It is for that reason that my group places so much importance on the next multiannual financial framework, which is presently under discussion, as it will allow us to continue to finance our common policies. These funds constitute the base of European solidarity and are an essential instrument for growth and employment. In the 1950s, European integration was necessary to guarantee peace and security in our continent. Today, this same integration is essential in order to protect our European social model which we have patiently constructed. It is essential in order to defend our common interests in international trade. It is essential for the promotion of our values and our humanist ideals, human rights, human dignity, transparency and the rule of law. That is why I repeat my call for a politically integrated Europe, not an intergovernmental Europe, as was supported by the Council in the Schengen case, or again last week concerning the issue of patents. For as long as the Community method is not our governance rule, nor that of the Council, Europe will lose ground. I know you have a difficult job, Mr Van Rompuy, but fear not! Make proposals with us, with Parliament and the Commission, to these Heads of State or Government who, as I said, do not have the capacity for reflection as they are obligated to manage their very difficult issues on a daily basis in each of their respective countries. We need a much more integrated Europe. We must compare what works, the countries that cope – because there are some – and apply their example to those that work less well. There you have what I want us to put on the table, Mr Barroso, during the next two months. We will reflect further on this during the holidays and then we will make proposals in September, if the markets allow us to do so. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, allow me to ask a question as I, like you all, am very worried. If you look at the statistics, they show that from September onwards, we will increasingly see a situation in which some countries will have made unswerving efforts over a period of several years, and other countries will not have made such efforts. These countries will refuse to continue and will no longer be able to pay for solidarity because things are going badly for them. Therefore, in the Democrat groups, we must also, from August onwards, discuss the formulation of real proposals. For we cannot spend money that we do not have. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that the Member States tackled the real problems and had the courage to answer the real questions. It is time for the European Council to finally adopt tough measures on 28 and 29 June, rather than settle for fall-back mechanisms that are immediately overtaken by events. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), these real questions in actual fact boil down to one: are we ready to make the necessary political leap to make the European Union and the euro area work? This is a question that could not be asked two years ago. Are we both clear-headed and politically courageous enough to defend and organise shared political sovereignty, or are we going to allow our laws, our policies, our societal choices to be dictated by the financial markets and banks, as we have been doing for two years now, lurching from one crisis Council to the next?

 We must assume our responsibilities once and for all. What we want is a European Union with a social and fiscal model, and we need to show this. This is a difficult time and, in times of crisis, we move forwards and not backwards. We have to face reality and stop deluding ourselves. The reality is that no country in Europe can tackle global challenges, whether economic, social, demographic, military or political, single-handedly. We see this every day. Each Member State says, ‘I do not need Europe, I do not need Europe,’ and, the next day, it asks for help. Members of the Council, the reality is that, over the last 60 years, we have achieved peace and prosperity and that this has been possible thanks to a method, the Community method. I believe deeply in this method, just as I am convinced that Europe is the solution and not the problem. So, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 and 29 June, notwithstanding such important issues as economic governance, the credibility of the euro, and financial perspectives, the PPE Group will, first and foremost, call on the Member States to make a choice, a major choice that will determine the rest: do you want to ensure a future for Europeans and to focus on what is really important, which is to ensure strong political integration through the Community method? Or do you prefer to keep on pretending that you have economic sovereignty only to find, the day after each summit, the day after each meeting of Finance Ministers, that the decisions taken are inadequate and untimely and that we are heading for disaster? Do you prefer, as you did on 7 June in relation to Schengen, to withdraw to your borders and fall back on your intergovernmental arrangements? If you go for the first option, Parliament will be happy to work with you to find lasting solutions to the problems of our fellow citizens. However, if the Council stubbornly refuses to agree on the main issues, we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel in the short term. Those are my requests to the Council. I would also like to request that the President of Parliament be finally given the opportunity to debate with the Heads of State or Government all the subjects that will affect the future of Europeans. The President of the Commission has his place in the Council, as does the President of the Central Bank. Is the democratically elected President not as worthy as the President of the Central Bank? (Applause)
 The person who represents 500 million Europeans, presides over the only institution elected by universal suffrage, and who leads the institution that legislates with the Council is asked to leave the Chamber after he has given his presentation. What democracy, what transparency can we demonstrate to the outside world? European integration cannot be achieved without the democratic legitimacy embodied by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, I will end by saying – and I know that you repeat things time and again, as we do, in this Chamber – that we need to continue to make recommendations. We need to continue to table new proposals on social and fiscal union and we must not be afraid to publicise them. Go ahead – Parliament is with you. We are the driving force behind the proposals, and the Council needs us in the difficult crisis situation in which it finds itself. It needs to find solutions and we need to put them on the table, even more so than we have done so far. You can count on us. I would also like you to go further and publish, every three months, an up-to-date table of the economic and social measures on the internal market taken by each of our governments, both on the right and on the left. Europeans need to know which Member States are making an effort to get their public finances back in shape and to promote growth and jobs and are not just talking about doing so. All these proposals need to be continued. We are going to haul Europe out of the crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, what the PPE Group wants is honesty with regard to our fellow citizens and, above all, a great deal of political courage. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 I think I have always had the courage to say what I think and I have had it all my life. It is the only thing I inherited from my father, who told me, ‘Take care never to be taken hostage,’ and whenever I was taken hostage, it never lasted more than two days, I assure you, Mr Cohn-Bendit.

 Mr President, I will try to stay calm, even though I am absolutely seething. Minister, we had already been provoked, and you have provoked us even further this morning. However, I will stay calm. (Applause)
 By deciding unanimously, against the opinion of the European Commission, to alter the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the interior ministers have made a decision that is completely unacceptable to the Group of the European People’s Party. I would like to thank Ms Malmström for the courage she showed right to the end. She did not bend under pressure from the Council. (Applause)
 Ms Malmström, we will need the Commission over the next few weeks, as the debates will be tough. Minister, I am surprised that you did not introduce visas at the same: you would have protected our 500 million consumers even more. (Applause)
 By proposing this initiative, you have broken the bond of trust with this Parliament: this initiative has broken the fundamental principle of the community method in a very dangerous way and, as you know, I am very attached to that principle. You have attacked it and you will find us blocking your way. This principle prevents the larger Member States from imposing their will on the smaller States. It ensures that Europe’s general interest comes before national interests. You have broken that, my friend. The European Parliament and Commission are the guardians of this community method, and we have no intention of giving up on it. Last Thursday, I asked the Presidency of the Council, in the person of Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is a former member of the European Parliament herself, to appear before this Parliament to explain her position. She telephoned me yesterday evening, and I think she ought to have been here this morning, because the community method is important and she knows what she is talking about. The Danish Presidency does not have enough respect for Europe’s 500 million citizens to even bother to tell them why it has denied its Members of Parliament the right of codecision on a subject as important as freedom of movement. As far as I am concerned, since the evening of 7 June, the Danish Presidency is over. Between now and midnight on 30 June, we will address either the Council or the incoming Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus. You should know that I had to think long and hard before saying that, but you have broken the community method. That is something that must not be done. (Applause)
 At a time when the economic and social crisis we are going through calls for a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and respect from everyone and from all our national and European leaders, you have broken that respect. By withdrawing their trust in Parliament, the Member States are going in the opposite direction to the one that will allow us to come out of the crisis from the top down: in other words, via political integration between us. The solution to our problems is not to withdraw behind our borders; quite the opposite: the solution is shared sovereignty and joint management, in a spirit of mutual trust and of respect for the thing we hold most dear: our freedoms. Our group asks the Council to reverse its decision. Only by doing this will it be able to come back to this European Parliament. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are celebrating Europe. This celebration on 9 May is particularly significant at a delicate time for European integration in economic terms, but also in political terms. We often forget the progress our countries have made since signing Robert Schuman’s declaration, yet never in our history have we known such an area of peace and prosperity in spite of the current crisis. We Europeans have paid a high price to understand that there is no difference between our neighbours and ourselves. We know at last the value of tolerance, of dialogue, of solidarity, which take precedence over individualism. Ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism and the lure of populism require our attention. Left-wing populism has no more place in Europe than right-wing populism. I urge all the mainstream political parties to remember that they have nothing to gain and everything to lose if extremism becomes commonplace. Intellectual shortcuts and easy solutions are mere demagogy. They simply entertain the false hopes of our citizens, which quickly come to nothing. How, then, in this context, can we reduce Europe’s democratic deficit? As I said, Europe is experiencing a difficult period and the decisions that will be made over the coming months will determine the stability of our economies and the social cohesion of our countries. The debt crisis and the recent attacks on the markets against our currency have at least had the merit of making us aware of the deterioration of public finances that has been going on in several European countries for decades. We have shown, in Parliament, with the ‘six-pack’, with the fiscal treaty, and soon with the ‘two-pack’ as well, that Europe has demonstrated the courage to take itself to task and reverse this trend. However, our efforts have only just begun and we must under no circumstances relax them. I must say, what worries me most is this current political debate between growth and cleaning up national finances. Indeed, behind the caricatures, it is not that there are those in Europe who are in favour of good management and those who are in favour of growth, simply because they are two sides of the same coin, as I have often said here in this Chamber. The reality is that we cannot separate deficit reduction and growth, and you have said so yourself. There will be no sustainable growth unless we reduce our debts and this reduction will come about all the more quickly with strong growth. The reality is that growth-stimulating measures cannot be synonymous with additional spending. We no longer have the resources. The reality is that, as long as the most spendthrift countries refuse to lead debt-reduction policies, the countries that are themselves making an effort towards sound management will no longer be able to show solidarity. Ladies and gentlemen, confidence is what will come from investment and growth. I am not talking about artificial growth. There is only one way to achieve this: enhancing the competitiveness of our economies in the context of globalisation. Europe has a promising future so long as we all assume our responsibilities and we implement the decisions that have already been adopted. We know very well what is needed: completing the single market, investing in research and development to continue to play the leading role among 21st century economies, and reducing administrative burdens to unlock the potential of our SMEs and our companies. It is in this way, and by cleaning up our public finances, that we will ensure growth and that we will create jobs for the future. Robert Schuman’s declaration paved a new way for Europeans. Now more than ever, we are bound together. We are united, responsible for one another, and this involves budgetary convergence, which is under way, but also fiscal and social convergence. Yet this solidarity can only work if each of us makes efforts and is ready to combine cleaning up public finances with sustainable growth. You know that Robert Schuman’s declaration brought us a project for peace, which has been a success. Let us say it too. However, I should like to finish with these words: solidarity, responsibility, enthusiasm, conviction and let us have a project for the future, for growth and for employment. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of European fiscal discipline, we have achieved a lot in a short space of time. What we did was necessary, because in 2008 and last autumn, we were on the brink of disaster and we almost lost everything: the euro, our financial system, but, above all, our credibility in the world and our social model. We now have the instruments for greater discipline. We needed to do all of this so that Europe could regain its credibility. We needed to do all of this to create the conditions for a return to growth. Growth which, being the only way to get us out of crisis, must be at the heart of our debates, starting with this afternoon’s. We cannot achieve growth by passing laws, but what we can do is create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth. How so? Firstly, by focusing on European policies for growth and employment and putting others on hold. This means acting quickly to conduct a qualitative audit of European public expenditure so that we can make informed decisions. The EU budget must be one of the key instruments for kick-starting the European economy. Therefore, having done it with fiscal discipline, I propose a joint initiative committing us to growth, an initiative that would make the EU budget a reserve for investment for all of us. The growth principle needs to be the equivalent of the principle of subsidiarity. This principle would mean that each proposal, each EU policy would, in future, have to demonstrate how it contributes to growth. No potential for growth, no money. That should be our rule for the next two years. This principle would mean that we could, for example, examine the issue of trade agreements. Are we gaining market shares or are we losing them? Are we gaining jobs or are we losing them? Another point close to my heart, as you know, is the single market. Twenty years after its launch, as I have already said and I will go on saying, we have a duty to achieve it fully. Our 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises need it, because unlike the major players, they cannot adapt to the competitiveness gaps that still exist today. We therefore have to do it for our SMEs, the very ones who, over the past decade, have created 85% of new jobs. Business leaders are now being accused of being rich. Did you know that, like me, these bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises earn at most just EUR 1 000 to 1 200 and are looking for contracts that will guarantee employment to the workers of their SMEs. Here, too, Mr Barroso, we need to support them so that the banks offer finance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Instead, they are dropping them, and that is not right. We need to establish a more effective support. We need to adopt a much stricter approach in order to maintain support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These are jobs that exist and we do not want to lose them. On the completion of the single market, let me add another point: we need to reduce paperwork and red tape which, alone, costs our economy nearly EUR 40 billion. We need to simplify matters in order to move on. Ladies and gentlemen, the growth we need to kick-start our economy is not the growth of the future. What we need, right now, is to rapidly increase the added value that these companies bring. What we need is productivity gains in public services. What we need is an employment policy adapted to the new situation and I welcome the proposals adopted by the Commission this morning in this regard. The markets have already shown renewed confidence in the Union. This confidence will remain thanks to the unprecedented discipline and solidarity of Europeans. Such solidarity was inconceivable just two years ago. I also welcome the Commission’s plan for putting the Greek economy and its public finances back on a sustainable path and for guaranteeing financial stability in that country and in the euro area as a whole. It is now up to our Greek friends, whose courage I commend, to stay the course, before and after the upcoming elections. Ladies and gentlemen, we must make the most of this new impetus to step up a gear and urgently refocus the EU’s action and budget on real growth. I would like to thank the Commission – José Manuel and his team – for their work, which is no mean feat, and I also call on the Member States to move up a gear as they are the ones with deficits. It is now time for them to move back up into top gear to restore growth and jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 I will do what my friend, Georges Marchais, used to do. I did not understand the question but I will give you an answer anyway. Anyhow, my dear friend, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is responsible for what is happening in the various countries as we shoulder our responsibility. If we have made mistakes, then we need to accept where we went wrong. That is the first point. As for the second, I do not understand what you are saying about my group. We voted for the ‘six-pack’, that was the first point. We are currently preparing the ‘two-pack’, and I do hope it will be based on the growth and employment model favoured by you. As I way saying … I do not really know what you were driving at … I am also a company director working on a voluntary basis to manage my company employing just 160 people. I do not get a penny from it. We have faced difficulties four or five times now and, each time, with the help of my employees, we have managed to get ourselves out of trouble. However, we are not yet out of the crisis and that is why I maintain that it is vital that we keep the jobs we have and create new ones. That is my answer, my dear friend. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, you are aware of what is happening in Argentina as concerns the threat of nationalising YPF, a company in which the Spanish group Repsol is a shareholder. We are calling for a debate with a resolution because we wish to protect European investments in third countries and, more specifically, to react to the unilateral and arbitrary decision taken by the Argentinean authorities. We are calling for this debate to take place tomorrow and for a resolution to be drafted that we can work on and later put to the vote. We do not need to adopt it tomorrow. We can do it on Thursday. That is our group’s request. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your appointment, and I wish you a great deal of courage for the next two and a half years, since we all need good proposals to create jobs in Europe. I think there are two lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The first is putting national and regional finances back on track, and it can wait no longer. The signing of the fiscal treaty, with 25 members, two days ago, shows that this lesson has been learnt by the most far-sighted countries of the EU. The treaty imposes an obligation on its signatories to show good faith, honesty and discipline. However, everyone knows that actually applying a provision is more important than signing it. This is where we are waiting for the Member States, and for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties. Everyone remembers how the Stability Pact was infringed by the largest Member States. Everyone remembers that a certain President of the Commission even called it ‘stupid’. I therefore welcome the fiscal treaty which is, with the ‘six-pack’ and, soon, the ‘two-pack’ as well, a useful instrument. However, I would like to call for vigilance regarding how they are actually applied. The second lesson to learn from the crisis is the emphasis to be placed on a return to sustainable growth and growth that creates jobs. I must say that, in this area, there has been no real progress since the start of the crisis. The Council meeting in January merely contented itself with making recommendations to the Member States, without any coordination or overall plan. As for the Commission, it is working extremely hard, but the many initiatives it is undertaking would be better understood and more effective if they formed part of an overall project, particularly a project for growth and employment. Above all, I am struck by the difficulty and also the slowness with which too many Member States are applying the rules to which they have, nonetheless, made a commitment. On this point, I also expect the Commission to be more vigilant in its efforts to put Member States back on the right path. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is proposing two courses of action, which it will place on an official basis in a public letter to the Council and the Commission. The first area concerns the internal market. At the end of this year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market. However, 20 years on, there are still more than 150 bottlenecks hampering the operation of that market. It is for this reason that I am calling not only for us to ensure that the rules that have been adopted are actually applied, but also for a legislative package to be put forward, together with a precise timetable to enable us to complete the internal market. This is an urgent matter and within in it we can find, as I say every day, at least a small percentage of growth for all the countries, which is very important at this difficult time. The services sector, which is vital for Europe’s economy, constitutes in itself one of the largest blockages. Prices vary within the European Union; they can be up to twice as high for medicines, three times as high for medical treatments, four times as high for certain kinds of insurance and 100 times as high for the same university qualifications. When we know this, it is clear that action can wait no longer. Of course, we cannot do everything at once. It is for this reason that I call upon the Commission to start with a new legislative initiative in 10 sectors of the internal market. The second course of action recommended by the PPE Group concerns the investments needed for growth. I am also proposing, on this point, that in the European budgets for the next few years, a share allocated to investments generating growth and jobs should be protected. Let me be clear: it is not a question of new expenditure or additional budgets, but of channelling funds that are already available towards sustainable investment. Finally, we must provide ourselves with our own resources. It is not widely enough known that one euro invested by the EU can produce, through its multiplier effect, up to EUR 5 in investment. To take the example of energy, in 2010, the EUR 4 billion injected into the sector ended up generating EUR 22 billion in investment. I will finish with this: our fellow citizens, particularly young people, need jobs now. Our economy needs small growth to begin with and guaranteed growth for the future. The budget pact will ensure healthy and honest finances. Mr Barroso, I believe that on this point, you are right. We must combat tax evasion more rigorously. You have quoted the figures, and it is an enormous problem. We must act to create jobs, while the completion of the single market and the protection of the investment budget ought to generate sustainable growth and jobs. Joseph Daul  (PPE

Mr President, I would simply like to know what the reaction of my friend Guy Verhofstadt is, since Mr Sarkozy does not have a representative of the Front national
 in his government. We have a problem regarding the Netherlands, where the government has never condemned anything. That is much more dangerous and much more insidious. The second thing I would like to ask him is this: when Neelie Kroes says that Greece must leave the euro, I have never heard Mr Verhofstadt criticise the suggestion. Please answer these questions.

 Madam President, Vice-President Reding, thank you for being here and thank you, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council for attending this sitting. This afternoon, we are talking about racism and discrimination. These are serious issues, but they are clearly not serious enough in the eyes of the Dutch Prime Minister for him to come and debate them with us. Nevertheless, it is because of a partner in his parliamentary majority that we are forced to hold this debate today. Over and above his empty chair politics, I regret, above all, that the Dutch Prime Minister is refusing to distance himself from a website that is racist, violent and misleading. Indeed, it is wrong, first and foremost, to say that European workers do not contribute to the Dutch economy. Throughout Europe, the economy has benefited from the mobility of workers from Central and Eastern Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, although it is not perfect, the internal market, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of the pillars of Europe and there is absolutely no doubt that Dutch companies have benefited from it over those 20 years, as have companies from other countries, and that they have taken advantage of the Central and Eastern European market. Indeed, since 1993, those companies have invested more than EUR 23 billion in Poland, they are the largest investors in Romania and I congratulate them on that. However, beyond the economy, I ask the following question in particular: what message is the Dutch Prime Minister sending when he refuses to condemn the PVV website? That the single market is only for goods and services, and not for workers, men and women? That there are good and bad workers, depending on the passport they hold? The internal market is not a one-way street. Its rules apply to everyone alike. They apply to services, to financial transactions and to workers. I will say it again: Europe is not just a single market; it is also and, above all, a community of values. We know only too well that discrimination, racism and xenophobia led to the darkest pages of our history. Here among us are Members whose parents fought and died to liberate Europe and the Netherlands 60 years ago. Can we in all good conscience remain silent and fail to respond to the incitement to hatred of certain parties? I will simply repeat what the Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke said: ‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) reiterates its moral appeal to the Dutch Prime Minster to condemn the offending website clearly and quickly and, like Ms Reding, I am very pleased that here in this Parliament, the democrats have tabled a joint motion. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trust is the foundation of the single market, the foundation of the European Union. However, the financial crisis has undermined this trust, the trust that our fellow citizens have not only for each other but also for policy makers, and this distrust continues to grow. In the face of this danger, we must be unambiguous. We need measures to restore confidence in the good management of our finances and the Treaty to be signed next month will be one of the cornerstones of this. We also need measures to restore confidence in the governance of the euro and this cannot be achieved by issuing contradictory statements. In this regard, I am very surprised by the statements made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the Commission, who is of the opinion that it would not be a tragedy if Greece left the euro area. I ask the Commission: is this your official position? I would ask the Commission to address this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, after years of imprudent management of public finances in many of our countries, now is the time for change. This applies even more to Greece of course, but we will not avoid spending cuts —and Greece cannot take any more. Our Latvian friends showed the way some years ago, by reforming their public management without any outside help and accepting painful sacrifices that led to a return to growth. That is why, for my part, I also trust in the Greek people’s enormous sense of responsibility and I am not among those who would have them believe they will immediately overcome the crisis without reforming. That said, as I stated just after the last European Council, it will take more to build the economy than growth and employment reforms. However, the package proposed to us at this stage is not, in any way, up to the challenge. I firmly believe this is no longer the time for business as usual. It is time to make commitments on a par with those of the post-war Marshall Plan or even the 1992 single market project. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for Europe to be ambitious. The time has come to establish a project which mobilises all our resources to restore growth and employment. My group expects the European Commission to propose a legislative package of this kind, in close cooperation with Parliament, as we did with the ‘six-pack’. This package could include measures as ambitious as completing the internal market. We need to know which countries are still blocking this market. The Single Market Act, the Services Directive and the European Patent are all being blocked by an absurd dispute over location. This package must also reduce the burdens imposed on our businesses which stifle their competitiveness. In return, leave it to them to commit to providing more employment, above all, for young people. Ultimately, there is no magic formula for overcoming this crisis unless we demonstrate political will, have the courage to tell our fellow citizens the truth and see through our commitments. As a former manager, I can tell you, I have lived through many crises and I would ask the Commission and the Heads of State or Government who are always thinking of the next election — I understand this and therefore, it is up to us, in Parliament and in the Commission, to show them the way, to put forward proposals, bold proposals for major projects, for example — to establish the internal market and condemn those who do not. These are measures, small measures, which together will perhaps allow us to quickly return to 1% growth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr Fox, no, we need rules, and I am a firm liberal like you. However, allow me to explain my liberalism for you. Imagine a football pitch. There are two teams playing.

 – (FR) 
Mr Lambsdorff, I do not wish to be rude but although I know Ms Kroes well, as she has been with us for a long time, I see things differently. If Greece files for bankruptcy, there are some insurers who will pay out 75% to certain companies. If it does not file for bankruptcy, these companies will be forced to give up 75%, or even 100%, of what they have invested in Greece. I am simply asking the question and we will ask Ms Kroes whether she ever thought about this. Secondly, I spoke to Mr Samaras on the telephone yesterday evening. He expelled 21 members from his party on Sunday. That is what I call a brave man. Have you ever expelled 21 members because they didn’t vote in favour of a text? It is clear to me that Mr Samaras does not lack courage. He proved this on Sunday evening. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in this Assembly, we are convinced that Europe must both restore its public finances and find the road to growth. That is what you have just said to us. I would like to say to you, Mr Monti, that the economic reforms that you have undertaken in your country serve as an example of this twin approach. On the one hand, you have continued with many reforms initiated by the previous government, and this too you have told us about. On the other hand, you have made major changes, especially by liberalising some professions. That is the right approach as it will create jobs and stimulate competition. Thanks to your proposal to introduce a type of flexible security, you will strengthen the social market economy, and you will make the labour market more dynamic and more protective too. Your fight against fraud and in favour of a more transparent tax system is equally appropriate and will allow a reduction of the tax burden borne by Italians. My group supports this package of measures which, I will repeat, serves as an example for Europe. I hope that many countries will follow suit, since a return to growth requires us to re-establish a favourable economic and political climate. We also have to give hope back to our fellow citizens, not a false hope that would soon be dashed as it foundered on the realities, but a hope based on the development of a more competitive economy and on the indispensable reforms of our collective lifestyle. Now, like most European countries, the Italian economy is strong, as it is built on a real economy, on competitive sectors that are full of potential. Mr Monti, you have begun to optimise this potential, to free the economy from burdens that were overwhelming it. We must do likewise in all of our countries and take our example from those who do it best. We must promote under-used resources via, as you said, both national and European policies. In particular, we must allow our SMEs, our researchers and millions of Europeans, especially the young unemployed, to develop their potential. This policy requires a spirit of responsibility, the very one that you, my dear Mr Monti, are displaying at the head of your government. For some, there is a great temptation to confuse public spending and investment, as you have said, but it is only through investment that we shall achieve sustainable growth. Former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, used to say that one cannot fall in love with the internal market. On the day after Saint Valentine’s Day, neither can one fall in love with European competitiveness. However, Mr Monti, in the report that you have published on the re-launch of the single market, you laid out some good pointers on how to restore growth and employment. I would like to speak about greater fiscal coordination between the Member States. I would like to speak about a new impulse for political and social support for the integration of the European market. I would like to speak about the internal market which, almost 20 years after its launch in 1993, remains unfinished. You reminded us of this. Mr President, although everyone knows how much I favour the Franco-German engine, to the same extent I wish that, like Italy, other countries would make their opinions, their proposals or even their counter-proposals heard. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome your determined commitment to the Community method and to European integration. Like the European Parliament, you know, Mr Monti, that the return of the intergovernmental method would be a serious mistake, a retrograde step for the 500 million Europeans. I am grateful to you for having punched to your full weight. Carry on opposing this intergovernmental method. You have the majority of this Parliament with you. This Parliament wishes to make another voice heard, that of a united, responsible Europe, that of an integrated, political Europe. We know that we can count on you as an ally in this. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, as we speak, more than 600 people have died in Europe, victims of the cold and, above all, isolation. This is an opportunity to remember that Europe is not just about economics and finance. It is first and foremost about solidarity, and the spell of cold weather affecting our people is an opportunity for us to prove it. Yet what are we seeing? Food supplies for European food aid programmes are at their lowest and here we have called for help for the NGOs in charge of them. Some EU countries have taken these programmes hostage and have only renewed them until 2013, using legal problems as an excuse. We are also seeing that not enough is being done in response to the real scandal of food waste. I am referring here to all that is being thrown away by major supermarket chains every day when we all know that there are organisations that do not have enough food to hand out at the moment. It is high time that we reacted by putting our support networks into action. Having been mayor of a village for many years, I know that it is at local level that things first play out and I welcome the informal assistance networks that have sprung up over the last few weeks. These are the most effective networks and these are the ones we must support. We must also react by extending the European food aid programme. It is also high time that we promoted a common energy policy. What, then, are the facts? Today, people in need are having their gas and electricity cut off because they cannot pay their bills. Yet we are reacting much too slowly in all our countries. Here too, we must call for help. Finally, Mr Barnier, we must update the basic European civil protection project that we are so desperately lacking. We must act to stop the same tragedies and the same emergencies from happening again year after year. We have experienced them and we must be prepared. We must provide our NGOs and our fellow citizens who are dealing with these issues with the necessary means to do so rather than passing them over to large organisations. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, 25 Member States faced their responsibilities by agreeing to sign the fiscal treaty. They decided to fight against the poor budget management which has left us without the necessary room for manoeuvre to stimulate growth and employment. They showed their ability to find European solutions to European problems, even though two Member States decided that they would rather go it alone, which they will live to regret. I have, at this stage, three wishes. The first is that this treaty be ratified as quickly as possible, the second is that it be applied as quickly as possible and the third is that this agreement be fully integrated into EU law, as Parliament has called for. Ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has forced us to rethink our bad habits. It has forced us to respect the rules of balanced budgets, which are obvious, yet so difficult to apply. We must reduce national deficits, which also often cover up regional and local deficits. However, while the decision on this treaty is the correct decision and a positive one, the decision on growth leaves me rather disappointed. This is because combating deficits and stimulating growth are two sides of the same coin. One without the other will not help Europeans to escape from the difficulties they are facing, particularly the unemployed. There are two ways of boosting growth: one is artificial and has no future, the other is structural and therefore sustainable. The first is to kick-start the economy through spending. That is what we have been doing for years and look where it has brought us. Never mind the fact that, today, spending is actually limited, as the time has come to repay our debts, and not to borrow. The second method, the one recommended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is to make our economy more competitive. This could already be done, Mr Barroso, by finally completing the internal market. All the laws, all the texts were adopted long ago. The problem, once again, is that they have not been applied. I therefore call on the Commission to let us know as soon as possible which countries are not applying these rules and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties by placing restrictions on those which do not apply them – perhaps even France, my friend, as I make no exceptions. All Europeans should know which States are playing the internal market game, and which States are slowing it down or standing in its way. Increasing our competitiveness could also be achieved by reducing the charges that weigh heavily on entrepreneurs and by reducing the considerable discrepancies in charges between our countries, which harm competitiveness. This could also be done by getting as good a return as possible from European Funds that have been allocated to the States but have not yet been used. The time has come to make the best use of this – considerable – surplus by investing it in common projects to create growth and employment. Finally, growth and job creation can be encouraged by turning public funds, which are not bringing in investments, towards research and innovation, or towards training. With a quarter of young people looking for a job, we must offer them the chance to acquire strong skills and to redirect them anywhere in the EU. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, chairing the Council of Ministers of the Union at this time is not an easy task, but I am sure that, after your training as an MEP, Prime Minister, you are fully equipped for this task. Madam President, I endorse the four priorities under which you have so classically positioned your six months at the head of the Council, namely, responsibility, European dynamism, green Europe and security. I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide. That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however. My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency. I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors. The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method. Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth. Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency. Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens. I wish you all the best for the next six months. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, in 2010 Hungary’s citizens entrusted you by a very large majority with the task of carrying out reforms. You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election. The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature. Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly. Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr President, what we are dealing with today is a fundamental discussion about our values and rights. I would like to ask Mr Swoboda: did this Parliament ever have to ask for a commissioner to be sent to Hungary because of repression under the socialist regime? I have never heard of Parliament having made such a request, and no repression of the sort took place. Do you acknowledge that? Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, for once, I am not the first to speak up, but I would just like to point out that a debate has taken place. We are a democracy. If it is not working properly, the democrats are there to listen, to move things forward and change. You have all been to Hungary, as have I. For the time being, you can still move freely in Hungary and I do believe that we will be able to move around Hungary for a very long time to come. Politics is politics, but in Hungary there is freedom of movement. Yet it is true that it is not just Hungary facing the current difficulties; we are all facing them. This applies to the whole of Europe. The current crisis will increase the number of poor and I do not think that it is the Hungarian Government at fault for this. Nor would I accuse the governments of yesteryear blaming them for the deficits. We all have a duty to find the solutions. I am sure that here we are looking for solutions with Viktor Orbán, as he is no Chavez – a name which it pains me to use here in this debate, in a democracy, in a democratic house, this is one step too far and not normal. He is here, even if he is not perfect. Who is perfect? Let he who is perfect cast the first stone. I think that together we will find a solution. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, my dear Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you and to congratulate our new President. I wish you a great deal of courage, lucidity and strength to guide this institution, which collectively represents 500 million Europeans, in the most dignified and responsible way possible. However, I should firstly like to pay tribute to Nirj Deva and Diana Wallis who also stood as candidates to the Presidency of this institution. I should like to say to them that, although the two main groups in this House took the political decision at the beginning of this term of office to entrust the Presidency of Parliament to one of their own Members in turn, my group respects Mr Deva and Ms Wallis for standing as candidates and thanks them for their contribution to this election. However, this morning, Mr Schulz, I should also like to thank your predecessors and, in particular, Jerzy Buzek, whose capabilities as a statesman, which were already well-known in Poland, have been of great benefit to Parliament. Mr Buzek and, before him, Hans-Gert Pöttering and all their predecessors, starting with Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, all of the Presidents here today who have succeeded one another, have, in their own way, strengthened the powers and competences of this institution. Your political action, Mr President, will follow their lead. Mr President, for years we have had the opportunity to work together as chairs of our political groups. For the most part, I do not share your political convictions and our respective political groups have differing opinions on a number of subjects. This has not stopped us from placing our trust in you because, in the difficult situation facing Europe, what brings us together is far more important than what divides us. You are determined, as you have just told us, Mr President, to defend the European general interest resolutely in the face of diverse national interests. My group can only support you fully in this mission, in this action, knowing that the coming months will be one of the most critical periods that Europe has experienced since its creation. In our view, you have three priorities: defending the Community method, supporting the Community method and safeguarding the Community method. Nothing is more important than defending European heritage, namely, guaranteeing the general interest, protecting the small States from the bigger ones, and respecting their points of view without allowing it to lead to a deadlock. Nothing is more important than coming out of the crisis on top, through greater European integration, and nothing is more important than showing our citizens that the euro will be a strong, sustainable currency, insofar as we are doing what we should have done since its creation, namely, implementing political and economic governance. Finally, nothing is more important than preserving the common good that is solidarity between 500 million Europeans. Ladies and gentlemen, by creating what would become the European Union, the founding fathers have left us with a challenge the likes of which has never been seen, namely, uniting the destiny of countries and peoples who, in the past, tore one another apart and fought against one another for centuries. Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi rose to this challenge, and their successors, to this day, have kept this European dream alive in spite of the economic and internal difficulties, and in spite of a radical shift in the global geostrategic situation. It is our generation’s responsibility not to fail in this task. It is up to us to overcome the financial crisis, the current crisis of confidence, to guarantee our children – and you have said it yourself – not only a viable future, but, above all, a better future. This is a challenge primarily facing you, Mr President, and us, ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives of the people of Europe. It is up to you and us, along with the European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to display enough responsibility to convince our States that shared sovereignty, that real economic and political convergence, are our best tools to face the challenge of growth. Mr Schulz, as President of this institution, you will have to face many external challenges, and the PPE Group will be at your side to help you in the European spirit I have just mentioned. We would also encourage you to transmit this message to countries such as Ukraine, where Yulia Tymoshenko has faced unacceptable treatment, or Syria, where the population’s will to change has been unspeakably repressed. You are also planning to improve the internal functioning of Parliament and I welcome this. Your predecessors have largely paved the way and the recent adoption of a code of conduct is fully in keeping with the desire for greater transparency and greater responsibility from each of the Members. My group will therefore support you on this front. Mr President, from now on, you will be leading an institution unlike any other in the world: a plurinational Parliament, which votes on legislation. For two and a half years, you shall be the leader of a House that does not seek to impose on the Council the idea that we will not overcome our current difficulties by creating a new treaty, a new Parliament, new governance, but that seeks to convince the Council of this. Mr President, we will join forces behind you each time you defend this integrated Europe, this Europe of solidarity, this Europe that delivers innovative solutions. We will join forces behind you each time you plead the case of common European policies, as well as each time you fight for funding to live up to the ambitions of these common policies. Finally, we will join forces behind you each time you defend and promote the ideas and values that are the foundations of our Union beyond our borders, namely freedom, tolerance, respect for the weakest in society and solidarity. Mr Schulz, I wish you every success in your Presidency. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Presidents, Mr Tusk, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, rather than speaking myself, I simply wish to subscribe to your speech. At the end of the day, when it comes to speaking about Europe, your discourse is my discourse, it is ours, the discourse of our group, and indeed the discourse of many people within this Parliament. On 6 July, you gave us your vision of a Europe proud of its values, of its successes, of an inclusive Europe, of a Europe confident in its power to exercise its influence throughout the world. This is a vision that we share. Paradoxically, the current crisis may turn out to be a unique opportunity for Europeans to recover their enthusiasm, to bounce back, providing that we are able to adapt, providing that we are able to change our habits and the way we operate. Prime Minister, you indeed have suffered, and you know what suffering is. The old Europe no longer knows what it is to suffer. President-in-Office of the Council, with your government – I shall use just three of the examples that you have mentioned – you have helped to achieve, over your Presidency, the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance. The Polish Presidency, working in close collaboration with the European Parliament on an ambitious package for strong national public finance management, has shown that the Community method can be effective and can sit very well with the euro and the European Union. Similarly, we can credit to this Presidency progress on the supervision of financial markets. More generally speaking, Poland has been working side by side with the European institutions to advance the notion whereby it is an advantage and a way out of the crisis to share economic sovereignty between the 17, the 17 plus and Poland. As you so rightly said, and as I said yesterday, we must put together a way out of the crisis for our fellow citizens for January/February. Second example: the neighbourhood policy. The Polish Presidency has worked extremely energetically, both on the Eastern front, with the signing of the accession of Croatia, and with the launch, last September, of the Eastern Partnership, with the preparation of the association agreement with the Ukraine, and on the Mediterranean front, with European support for the current democratic process. I thank it for that. The third and final example is that in the field of law, the Polish Presidency has enabled considerable progress to be made both on the protection of patents and on European contract law. I hope that we will still be able to carry these through to completion under your Presidency. My group hopes that these efforts will be rewarded and that the final agreement will be signed in the days to come. President-in-Office of the Council, the Polish Presidency has not just produced legislative texts. It has supported a principle dear to my parliamentary group and to the overwhelming majority of this Parliament, namely, the Community method. Indeed, your country, like all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, is more aware than any other country in Europe of the price of freedom, and the importance of solidarity. You have made effectiveness and respect for other people’s opinions a priority, without seeking to impose your own point of view. For many of our Member States, this is an example worth following. We are counting on you – for when you stand down from the Presidency, you will remain an influential member of the Council – to ensure that this Community method returns and is implemented. I shall finish this speech by inviting every one of you in this House to read attentively Minister Radek Sikorski’s Berlin speech. On 28 November, he reminded us that we Europeans are in the uncomfortable position of standing on the edge of a precipice. If we take action, we can emerge from this situation, if not, we shall plunge into the abyss. The Polish Presidency has helped us to take action together. We now need to continue resolutely along this path. I shall repeat a sentence from a very well-known Pole, John Paul II: ‘Have no fear’. Let us work along the lines that you described this morning. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council opened the way, last Thursday and Friday, to governance of the euro area. It showed that the period of waiting, uncertainty and divisions is now behind us and that an end to the crisis is finally in sight. Twenty-six out of 27 States have demonstrated their desire to revert to a healthy finance policy by establishing strict rules allowing for a return to balanced budgets and a reduction in public debt, and by agreeing to incorporate those rules in their constitutions and ensuring that any instances of non-compliance are punished. Twenty-six out of 27 States have shown a sense of responsibility by ensuring that their main political and economic decisions are taken jointly, and by developing crisis mechanisms to be implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB). Twenty-six out of 27 States have conceded that shared sovereignty is preferable to sovereignty held hostage by markets. In short, the spirit of cooperation has prevailed over the attempt to create divisions. Determination has proved stronger than indecision. Three major issues still need to be resolved: that of the nature of the new agreement, that of the United Kingdom’s place in Europe and the attitude of the 26 towards it, and, finally, that of the crucial ‘growth’ strand of our economic policy. Ladies and gentlemen, since the United Kingdom has refused to support the decision taken by its counterparts, the resulting project is not a Community one, as we were hoping, and as I have often said, but an intergovernmental one. This situation presents us with a number of problems, not only legal problems, but political problems, too. My group calls for the European institutions to be fully involved in the discussions that will culminate in the drafting of the new provisions between now and March, and, in particular, for Parliament to be accorded its rightful place in this process so that it can ensure its democratic legitimacy. I solemnly call upon Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso to work closely with the European Parliament. We must ensure, in fact, that no radical changes are made to the spirit and the letter of what has been done for the last 60 years and what has made European integration the success that it is. Cohesion must continue to prevail over power struggles, something which only the Community method can ensure. The second major issue raised by the decision of 9 December concerns the United Kingdom’s place in Europe, and I will come to this. I respect the decisions that were made but, clearly, the UK’s isolation shows that its government sees the European Union as nothing but a free trade area, and that it has no interest in showing solidarity with, and acting responsibly towards, its partners. To my mind, this calls for a change in behaviour towards the country by the 26 and also, to some extent, within the European institutions. In particular, I believe that the UK rebate should be called into question, since the resources of our fellow citizens should be used for something other than rewarding selfish, nationalist attitudes. Solidarity is not a one-way street. It is time Mr Cameron’s coalition government was made to realise that and was reminded of its obligations, in particular, with regard to the financial regulation rules from which it even requested an exemption, which fortunately was refused. The third and final issue relates to the ‘growth and employment’ strand of our economic policy. Of course, there will be no growth unless we put our public accounts in order, but the Union must now set about strengthening and developing its industrial activities, exports and competitiveness with the same level of energy and coordination. Indeed, Europe will not resolve the crisis permanently without a radical two-pronged approach consisting of sound management, on the one hand, and growth, on the other. As far as Parliament is concerned, I believe that we need to work closely with the Commission, on the basis of the proposals it made two months ago. I believe that we must do so, Mr President, in order to overcome the crisis, and that we must vote by a very large majority in February. This is what I propose as ‘homework’ for the Christmas holiday, and on that note, I wish all of you and your families a very happy Christmas. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to reassure my fellow Member. With Christmas nearly upon us, I have neither a tank nor a Kalashnikov. Therefore, he is not in any danger over the Christmas holiday; you can be sure of that, Lord Dartmouth. Secondly, I clearly said that, if, as I believe, the United Kingdom has given up on showing solidarity with the other 26 States for now, then I do not see why the 26 should make a further concession regarding the budget. Let me be quite clear: this is not a declaration of war; it is simply about ensuring that solidarity is shown between everyone and not just one way. That is all! Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis is turning everything on its head and things are changing at an increasingly dramatic pace: changes in Greece and Italy, with the establishment of governments of national unity, which we welcome; whereas until now, our citizens saw European integration as being far removed from their day-to-day lives, now they are calling for more integration. Well, not everyone, as just yesterday, David Cameron saw fit to attack a Europe to which, last time I checked – yesterday afternoon –, his country still belongs, when what we really want is constructive positions, even from him, on how to emerge from the crisis. Still, all the influential players in the Union acknowledge – as I have been saying for years – that the answer to our problems is not less but more Europe. The solution is Europe. I think some presidents realise this. Those who do not are replaced; which is a good thing. A Europe that needs to be transformed along the lines of integration which should have been done when the euro was created because, I will say it again, the current crisis is not just a crisis of the euro which, this morning, Mr Juncker, was still trading at around 1.35 against the dollar – or 1.34 as it might have dropped a centime, which is still acceptable. The reason for this crisis is the mistake made in setting up a currency without giving it the governance needed to make it work. We need to acknowledge this political error, but, above all, we need to put it right, and very quickly. That is what the euro area Member States are being forced to try and do and, once again, I congratulate the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, which is hard at work but which, in my opinion, is not working quickly enough because when your house is burning down, the fire-fighters get to work and, I tell you, fire-fighters are never criticised. I used to be a voluntary fire-fighter myself. We would sum up after the fire: we would look at what had been lost and what could be improved. That is what I am asking of you, Mr Van Rompuy. Do not be afraid. Be stronger. We will work it out later. However, once again, I want to emphasise the importance of crisis management which is a new source of division in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing it more and more, we need to take care to distinguish between those that are in a deep crisis and those that have managed it better. We need to recognise this. I want to stress how crucial it is that the Seventeen take into account all the instruments of the Euro Plus Pact when making any decisions on governance of the euro area. Mr Juncker, this is your job, do it. There are many countries wanting to join the euro area. We must not create different categories of players in this Euro Plus zone. We must not leave those countries wanting to join warming up on the sidelines. We must not exclude them from strategic decisions taken in the dressing rooms. I want to underline, here, the merit of countries like Poland, which has the Presidency, and which, despite not yet being in the euro area, are making extremely brave efforts, from a political viewpoint, to clean up their finances and boost growth. We should encourage them; we should make them feel a part of our club. Similarly, and I shall say it again, we should not abandon the Community method. As much as I firmly believe that the Franco-German alliance is a key driving force in Europe – which recent weeks have again proved –, I call on all Member States to contribute and go further than Paris and Berlin, instead of complaining about the impetus provided by Paris or Berlin. Nobody is stopping them. Likewise, Mr Barroso, I also call on the European Commission, with your commissioners, to do everything in your power to safeguard, strengthen and shield European cohesion. Do what you can to reassure small and medium-sized States that the Community method is still the glue that holds us together, that makes us stand firm and binds us together. It is in times of difficulty that it needs to be reinforced. That is the main responsibility of both institutions, the European Parliament and the Commission, which stand up for the European general interest. I want to finish my part in the debate on a possible revision of the European Treaties. Yes, changes will definitely need to be made to put right what is necessary. Yes, these will definitely have to be major adaptations, given the significance of the issues at stake. My group is open to this process as long as there is open, democratic debate involving elected representatives and civil society as part of an agreement. Above all, however, we must not fall back into the temptation of spending all our time talking about the mechanical tools, to the detriment of our political objectives. We must not lose sight of what is urgent, namely credible economic governance, and of what is less urgent, and let us do what can and must be done to current treaties, if necessary by making small changes to the rules of procedure as I call them. I am thinking of the establishment of the internal market, of the rules governing financial supervision or credit rating agencies. I am thinking about the political role played by the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for economic and monetary affairs, which is yet to be defined. I am thinking about the rapid implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of macroeconomic surveillance. (The President interrupts the speaker following an interruption off-microphone from Mr Bloom)
 I am thinking about real budgetary, fiscal and social integration. Mr President, it is Europe which speaks while the anti-Europeans scream and shout. That is not my way of moving Europe forward. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, to start with, I would like to point out that in life, one can either see the glass as half full or half empty. I see the glass as half full. I would like to thank you for the work you have done over the last 48 hours, because as a farmer, I know that it is not always the right horse that gets the oats, and this morning I would like to give you the oats and tell you ... (Laughter and applause)
 If he does not like oats, he can give them to the Commissioners; no problem there, a few of them like them. The elements that I picked up straightaway from your speech, and which I want to reiterate here, are that we are dealing with the banks, we are not doing enough to challenge the rich, you understand what I mean by that, but above all, and I thank you for saying it, we need to take care of the poorest. It would be outrageous if we failed to find a solution concerning the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons before the winter months. (Applause)
 Some people thought that everything would be sorted out by Monday. I do not think anyone here in this House believed that, since we are responsible men and women. However, we were still apprehensive, and late last night I watched the news to see whether we would effectively have an even deeper crisis this morning or, as I have often said, whether we would start to see the end of the crisis take shape. I believe this Council has at least come up with an initial solution to the crisis, and I congratulate both of you – I know that it is not easy. Undoubtedly it does not go far enough, but I will come back to this. I also wish to highlight the progress made by the 17 countries in the euro area. Over recent weeks, we have seen the 17 countries in the euro area being criticised by those who are not part of it. I would like to point out, in this Parliament, that we are all Europeans, whether we are inside or outside the euro area. Nevertheless, we have duties and rights, and those who took centre stage the most were the 17. Here too I believe we have made progress. With regard to solidarity with Greece, following the release by the Troika of a new tranche of loans, the agreement announced last night with the banks sees 50% of the debt being written off. This is an achievement. The increase of the European Financial Stability Facility’s firepower is a step in the right direction and, as everyone knows, one of the trickiest aspects of the negotiation. The agreement of the 17 on this point is absolutely crucial. By ensuring that this Fund acts as a credit insurance for investors who buy loan certificates from countries deemed vulnerable, the resources of the Stability Fund will be increased. The third area in which progress has been made is bank recapitalisation. I believe that we have already referred to this. Consequently, the European Council and the euro area have kept their promises for the short term and for part – a small part, I would stress – of the medium term. My group encourages you to progress even more quickly, and you are not on holiday as far as I understand. Tomorrow morning further progress will have to be made. The most important thing is to adopt a new model of economic governance, without which the euro cannot work effectively in the long run. We say the same things every day here, but we can see that by dint of repeating ourselves, some things are starting to be done. This integration and this European policy are an absolute necessity. I note that the countries which are the first to ask the euro area to take strong action have, for years and even decades, vigorously rejected any proposal for fiscal harmonisation. They are quite simply being inconsistent. Ladies and gentlemen, the European project is not about imposing something on someone. The European project is not about placing anyone under supervision, nor about governing with no regard for the democratic balance of powers. However, the rules must be complied with, Mr Barroso, and we must ensure that the measures that have been accepted and signed on paper are truly applied in practice. The European project and the strategy for Europe are about an ambition: that of offering the 500 million inhabitants the chance to live with dignity. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) does not want us to depend in future on Chinese and Brazilian investment, but to draw on our own work and our own know-how. What the PPE Group wants is to map out the route that will lead to that outcome, and that requires a shared European sovereignty between all those who want it. Mr Van Rompuy, yesterday you made good decisions, difficult and brave decisions. Nonetheless, these measures are not the end result of a plan to exit the crisis, they are merely the beginning. I call on the Member States, I call on Members of Parliament, both national and European, and I also call on our fellow citizens to agree to further political integration. I call on this Parliament and, Mr Barroso, on the European Commission, to carry on defending the EU model, which is a model of inclusion and not exclusion. I hope that next week, the G20 will respect the decisions that Europe has taken. For that to happen, though, they must be sure that we will not stop halfway. We need more fiscal and social integration, even if it is not written in the Treaty. We need to move forward in that area. We cannot afford to wait 10 years, to wait until we have amended the Treaty. We must adopt rules of procedure if the Treaty cannot be implemented quickly. I think that we are in the process of proving that in the difficult moments of managing a crisis, we can make progress without respecting the Treaty to the letter. And that was a little painful for us in the European Parliament. We felt to some extent that we had been forgotten. However I do think, Mr Barroso, and you said so this morning, that you are applying what we voted for here. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, once again, our Parliament is being asked to debate the decisions that we expect to be taken by a European Council and, once again, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is calling for a European response – an EU response – to the crisis. Once again, a resolution will be adopted, tomorrow, by an overwhelming majority of MEPs, calling on the Heads of State or Government to show a sense of responsibility when they meet on 23 October. Like most of my colleagues who are present, I sometimes feel as though I am repeating myself and taking part in a discussion between the institutions and our Member States in which everyone is talking at cross purposes. Yes, we agree on the significance of the crisis, on the urgent need to come up with solutions, and on the vital mix of deficit reduction measures and measures to boost growth and employment, but we differ as to the measures that need to be taken and whether those measures should be taken piecemeal or with surgical precision. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must stop debating the ways in which it could possibly take its decisions and whether or not it should embark upon yet another reform of the Treaties. Europe must stop analysing, weighing things up and, above all, hesitating. Europe must act; Europe must put a stop to the debate about solidarity with Greece. Of course it must show solidarity, and the decision taken by the Troika yesterday was just as responsible as the political point-scoring episode in the Slovak Parliament was irresponsible. Europe must stop questioning whether or not we should cut our public deficits. Of course we should tackle public deficits at national and regional level! It is just a question of knowing how to do so and of making sure that any action we take is completely fair from a fiscal and social point of view. President Barroso, I am not going to read the text that I prepared for the Commission. I am simply going to congratulate you and tell you that I agree with what you have said today and that I am behind it. The only thing I would add is that I wish you luck in getting it past the Council, and you will have the support of our political group. Go for it, do not be afraid. Measures need to be taken before Christmas. Thank you very much, then, for this presentation that you have delivered to us today. When I talk about Europe, I am not just talking about Brussels and Strasbourg. I am also talking about Bratislava, London, and all the European capitals. They must understand that real sovereignty is not just the gilded treasures found in republican or royal palaces. Real sovereignty, ladies and gentlemen, is the ability to give our fellow citizens the life they deserve, the standard of living they work for, and freedom. We will not achieve that by withdrawing behind our national borders, closing the Schengen borders again or bringing back protectionism. Growth and jobs – although I know that the anti-Europeans do not agree, and I love the fact that they are grumbling, because it means that we are on the right track (Applause)
. Mr Farage, you gave a good example of this at the last Conference of Presidents, and I hope that it will be the same today – growth and jobs, President-in-Office of the Council, will only materialise again in Europe if, as from 23 October, our Member States play the game, the European game, the solidarity game, the game of ‘all for one and one for all’ fully, unconditionally and quickly. Let me say it again, for the third time in my speeches: we need to bring into line tax rates, retirement age and weekly working time, to mention just a few examples. My group has not given me enough time to list everything that is impossible in Europe. However, you know that the word ‘impossible’ is not in the French vocabulary. Therefore, anything is possible, and that is also my party’s slogan. Europe must act, and I am convinced that it will succeed. President Barroso, we need a response for our fellow citizens. What kinds of questions are we having to answer today in our campaigns? When I listen to people who have worked hard all their lives, who have a savings book, I find that the question they ask is: ‘Are our savings and what we have struggled to acquire throughout our life protected by Europe and the euro?’ Yes, they are protected! Yes! Therefore, that is the response we must give them; that is the guarantee we must confirm to them. We have a duty, at Heads of State or Government level and in the European institutions, to give them that initial response. As far as everything else is concerned, you are right; we do have the tools, we do have the political means. If we implement them, we will overcome the crisis. Moreover, I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that European countries are not the only ones that are contacting our offices today. We are also being contacted by those who are already worried about whether we are going to succeed and whether the euro, at EUR 1.10 perhaps, is going to revive the European economy in relation to that of other continents, which are beginning to ask themselves questions. As you have said, then, let us take action together, ladies and gentlemen; let us not play cat and mouse, but let us be bold. I am convinced that we are now going to pave the way for our exit from the crisis, for Europe’s exit from the crisis, so that we can restore it to its place in the world in which we want to live. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 The answer is very simple, Ms Jaakonsaari. We have done the following: last weekend, four of my colleagues travelled to Greece to hold talks with our sister party, in order to move things forward, as you mentioned in your question. We are therefore working on this issue every day, and at the end of the week, three more people travelled to the country. We are working in close cooperation both with the party and with the Greek delegation, and we are also discussing this issue within our group. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr Barroso, it is heart-warming to hear such a speech. Like you, I may give an analysis, but after this speech, we will act together. Europe is going through a confidence crisis and a growth crisis. As if that was not enough, it is going through a leadership crisis. It is high time that Europe came up with a political answer to the crisis. A united and strong answer, which puts politics in its rightful place, that is to say in the driving seat; I am talking to the Council. Because, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about a currency – the euro – created 10 years ago. We truly believe that we are giving ourselves the means to secure its governance. We talk about countries which, for decades, have lived above their means, always more, without wondering whether or not the money spent actually created growth and jobs. We talk about a Europe born to prevent internal conflicts and to ensure its peoples’ prosperity, a Europe that, until now, has succeeded on all these fronts. But we also talk about a Europe that is misunderstood, even criticised, because its leaders have not been able to explain why the choice of Europe is the only choice for the future and why the answer to global challenges can only be a European one. All too often, one forgets that the European Union is one of the most advanced and developed regions. It is the world’s leading power in terms of trade. Our duty is above all to make sure that it remains in that position. What is the problem, then? And how can it be solved? The problem is that, even though economists agree on the reasons behind the financial and economic crisis, and on how to respond to it – namely a mix of rigour and incentives for creating wealth and employment – the political class has not had the courage to set about the task. The reforms proposed these last few months by the Member States of the Union and of the euro area, in particular, are along the right lines. However, they are clearly insufficient, late and poorly explained, or not explained at all. They stem from the intergovernmental method which – it is plain to see – paralyses Europe, as you rightly said. The national approach, ladies and gentlemen, must give way to the European approach. We do not want to discuss subsidiarity here, but the Community approach is the only one that will enable us to meet in a united and effective way the urgent and huge challenges that are before us. I can understand that, in times of crisis, one feels the need to turn in on oneself. No, we must reach out and seek the Community approach. The European method is not two, three or four Presidents bringing different messages, but a single and swift exit strategy. Mr Barroso, you are the head of the executive for economic governance. You demonstrated it this morning in your speech. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) urges you to fully play your double role of proposing and implementing European legislation decided with the Council and Parliament. The Commission has a crucial role to play: that of guarantor of the European general interest. This is difficult and demanding, but necessary: we must resist national interests which are not always compatible with the common interest. (Applause)
 This is essential. That is why this Parliament placed its trust in you at the beginning of the mandate and continues to do so. Mr Barroso, I ask you to go even further in your ambitions, because there is urgency. There is urgency to save the euro, to demonstrate our solidarity towards Greece and towards all the member countries that are seeing their markets attacked and their rating downgraded. At the same time, it is urgent that these same countries adopt and implement measures that are a match for the events, for European solidarity comes at that price. We must act urgently, not in the months, but in the days and weeks to come, to prove to the world that Europeans are able to defend and stabilise their currency. If they do not do it, the whole European project will suffer in the long term. The decision that – I hope – this Parliament will take today on economic governance, the famous ‘six pack’, is an important step in the right direction. We now have to apply it as soon as possible, and the same goes for the decisions of 21 July on the stability funds. Mr Barroso, entrepreneurs need visibility and security. The markets expect the euro area and the countries of the Union as a whole to take strong and consistent measures for reducing expenditure but also for supporting growth. On the first aspect – that of streamlining public expenditure – a few days ago I called for a ‘big bang’, a common decision of the 17 on fiscal, budgetary and social convergence. I reiterate this call today. It is very difficult for one country in isolation to take the strong measures that the euro area’s financial situation requires. However, we must recognise that the election campaigns that are coming up in several European countries in the next few years will undoubtedly not be conducive to courageous measures. Therefore, I ask the Commission to seize the proposal to bring into line tax rates, particularly for businesses, but also retirement age and weekly working time. Europeans will only stand shoulder to shoulder with each other if they see the same rules applied. That is when we can feel European. (Applause)
 I am convinced that strong and swift decisions by the 17 on this triple convergence would have considerable impact and would be a tangible sign of leadership on Europe’s part. Ladies and gentlemen, I said this earlier on: the current crisis is as much a crisis of confidence, which calls for collective decisions like those I have just described, as it is a growth crisis. And without growth, Europe will be unable to reimburse even the interest on its debt. Without growth, Europe will not be able to develop or survive competition from emerging countries. This growth requires increased competitiveness, more resources allocated to education and training, as well as increased efforts in research, development and innovation. I call for a new public-private partnership with a view to creating centres of excellence in research and innovation and to creating – why not? – an Erasmus programme for first jobs, following the success of the Erasmus university scheme. I would like to see the European political policy-makers listening more to entrepreneurs and to social partners, since they are the ones who live with the reality of globalisation and who can help us emerge from the crisis. Ladies and gentlement, achieving growth also requires that we pay special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must not ride roughshod over them. They are the ones who bring us jobs and who help us to overcome the crisis. Yet they are asked to bear administrative, fiscal and social costs that are too high. If we want them to be able to expand and hire people, this growth will require greater flexibility for investing as well as for keeping and creating jobs. Ladies and gentlemen, the single market was the great idea of the 1980s. With the single market, Europe has won growth points and our manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale by gaining access to a continental market instead of a national one. Nonetheless, we all know that the European single market is far from being completed, especially in the services sector. I am asking the European Commission to get down to the task with as much ambition and determination as it showed 20 years ago. That is where growth is. Ladies and gentlemen, growth cannot be decreed. It is achieved by a whole series of structural measures, the ones precisely that we have already adopted in the Europe 2020 strategy. We now need to roll up our sleeves and above all apply these measures. It is time for Europe to speak strongly and intelligibly, not only to counter populism, which is the enemy of the European people, but to propose long-term solutions that our citizens understand and expect. It is time that our elected national representatives accept that voluntarily shared sovereignty is the only future for our countries, and I mean the only one. I am asking you, Mr Barroso, to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council a plan to get us out of the crisis. A plan that can be, for the 500 million Europeans, the chance for a fresh start, the chance to overhaul their project. We need bold actions and proposals, understood – I repeat – by our fellow citizens. Europe has always made progress in crises, but we still have to make the right proposals and believe in them. I always say that, before the crisis and after the crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. Things will be different. Mr Barroso, we must propose this change to our fellow citizens so that once again they believe in politics and in Europe. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, for weeks and months now, the leaders of the euro area have shown how determined they are to stand up for the euro and to make European solidarity the cornerstone for their political actions. Yet we need to recognise that what has been decided since the summer is not enough, is too late and, above all, difficult to implement. You get the feeling that it is the markets rather than politics now in the driving seat. That cannot last. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that only strong and simultaneous EU decisions will have the necessary weight to reassure our fellow citizens and the markets of our decision-making ability. Mr Juncker, intergovernmental management of the crisis has reached the end of the road. As both a head of government and President of the Eurogroup, can you tell us then what the plans are to get us out of the crisis? The worst thing is that we cannot see a way out. There are a number of instruments: Eurobonds, guarantees from AAA countries, quadrupling the stability fund’s firepower, but over and above these instruments, where is the political will and how do we bring it all together? We need to be strong and, above all, we need to lead the way in getting out of the crisis. So where are you? (Applause
) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the European Union has been seeking sustainable solutions; however, faced with the attacks on the euro, initiatives have been taken. I am referring here to the first public finance consolidation measures and to the positive golden rule proposal. I am also referring to the introduction of measures to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility and the establishment of new economic governance instruments, or the six-pack, on which I should like to see a definitive agreement reached before the end of the month. I am also referring to the coordination of national budgets and to this summer’s proposals regarding European economic governance, the financial transactions tax and tax harmonisation. (The speaker broke off due to an interpreting problem)
 Mr President, since the start of the crisis, billions of euros have been committed. European citizens are indeed concerned, as they can see no end to the efforts being asked of them. They feel as if they are feeding a bottomless pit, even though they are aware that this European crisis calls for a Europe-wide response and not only a national one. They question the ability of national and European leaders to end this crisis of confidence and growth once and for all. The markets remain unsatisfied, doubtful and particularly volatile, and react to the slightest rumour. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come, for eurozone Member States and for any other EU Member States that would like to be involved, to pull out all the stops and adopt strong measures, together and at the same time, to put an end to the doubts over the EU’s capacity to shoulder its responsibilities. President Barroso, President-in-Office of the Council, Europe must restore its credibility. Europe must face up to reality and regain control of public finances. It must prepare itself for a transitional period characterised by stringent financial management at both national and regional level, and by incentives for savers and for investment in innovation, education and training. Europe must undergo a dramatic transformation to be referred to as the federation of the United States of Europe, or simply integration. In this crisis, as in any other crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. The question is: are we capable, right now, of envisaging a different future for ourselves? I recommend that, on the basis of a Commission proposal, all eurozone governments and all other EU governments who so wish, take a decision to drastically reduce their debts by taking coordinated measures, all at once and on the same day, to ensure the viability of their pension systems and to actually harmonise their taxation, in particular their corporate taxation. By suddenly making economic governance a reality, and one that is accepted by all the Member States of the euro area, the EU would achieve two things: it would demonstrate its capacity to take long-term action, and it would strengthen cohesion between citizens, who would at last be subject to the same rights and obligations. By taking coordinated budgetary discipline measures while stimulating crucial growth in our economies, countries would establish a single or converging set of rules and would send a clear and strong message as to their will to further integration. I should like to say a word, President Barroso, about growth. We are constantly saying ‘growth, growth’. Many people still dream of achieving double-digit growth. Our primary duty is to sustain low growth and avoid deflation. The European institutions, for their part, must be more ambitious as regards common policies. We need those policies that we refer to regularly: a trade policy, an ambitious research policy, a food-safety policy, an industrial policy that has finally undergone reform, and above all a policy enabling the internal market to function properly. We have many regulations, but in these difficult times it remains to be seen whether they are actually applied. If there are things which need revising, we will revise them, but there is no need to add to them in the current climate. Let us also enhance integration of the euro area, the heart of European integration, in order to help reform the European Union. That is what we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for, as we are aware of the responsibility of the centre-right, which is in the driving seat in times of trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, our credibility is going to be at stake over the coming months. It is true that we are under very heavy attack, which is probably exaggerated in some areas. It is now up to us to show that the EU has the capacity to restore growth conditions and avoid succumbing to deflation. This, too, will safeguard employment levels. Everything must be done to protect our way of life as much as possible and to defend our values. A major integration effort is ultimately not the way to succeed. Instead, ladies and gentlemen, we must find a way, among responsible democratic political groups, of showing a new approach and a new path to our Heads of State or Government, who are in a very difficult situation. What I am asking of this Parliament, and of President Barroso and the President-in-Office of the Council, over the coming weeks, is unity, that is to say a single vision for European citizens for the four or five years to come. That is what we must work towards today. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, I will give a very brief answer to that. If agricultural support in Poland is harmonised, taxation will also be harmonised to a certain extent. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, by way of an introduction, allow me to say, Mr President-in-Office, that if, during these six months, you apply the European method you have described this morning – as I do not doubt you will – we will be considering ways to extend the Polish Presidency of Europe. (Applause)
 European integration will be at the heart of the priorities of the new Presidency of the Council, to the great satisfaction of our group. This integration, and especially this Community method, must feature in all the major debates over the coming months and years. I am thinking of the financial resources of Europe. It is a significant issue that we will discuss together for the 2014-2020 period. I am also thinking of the internal market. Mr Tusk, you are concerned about the rise of Euroscepticism in several countries. I share this concern, as does my group. Euroscepticism and isolationism are symptoms of a cancer in our society. Your response to this ‘every man for himself’ attitude is a call for integration, which echoes the watchword of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is not the problem, but ‘more Europe’ is the solution. Your Presidency will be dominated by the necessary consolidation of public finances in the Member States, the stabilisation of the euro and the opening of the debate on the financial framework. The euro can only be stabilised if the countries experiencing difficulties really implement the necessary reforms in order to reform public finances and to create the conditions to enable a return to sustainable growth. Half-hearted measures will not solve the underlying problems. If I take the case of Poland, which is growing by nearly 4% and, with an uncommon level of efficiency, has known how to best use EU funds since it became a member, I see that European solidarity, combined with political will, can lead to the construction of a real, solid economy. Mr Tusk, you are one of the few Heads of State or Government in Europe to agree to debate with the national parliaments, with this Parliament and with other European institutions about the issue of the resources needed for Europe to operate. You are, moreover, the only one willing to discuss an issue that is important to a large majority in this Parliament, namely, the introduction of own resources to finance Europe’s role. Therefore, we will be by your side to deal with this issue seriously and we know that this task will be challenging. The Presidency of the Council believes that all our economic and social policies must be based on the Europe 2020 strategy, which all Member States have already accepted. It is right because the economic crisis will only be overcome in a sustainable manner if the Member States understand that all 27 States acting together is less expensive and much more productive than each one acting in isolation. Solidarity, ladies and gentlemen, is not just virtuous; it is also profitable. That goes for European finances as well as for the internal market and I am pleased that the Polish Presidency has established this issue and, in particular, electronic services, improved working conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the long-awaited creation of a European patent system, or indeed the Single Market Act, as its main concerns. Mr Tusk, just like the European Parliament, you have found the recent disagreements on the Schengen issue hard to bear. My group supports you in your desire to strengthen our resources and our joint effort on our external borders. In this regard, I call on the Commission and the Council to take a clear position on the unilateral decision made by Denmark to exempt itself from the rules on freedom of movement. My group would like to express its serious concerns. I would like to know what your position is, and that of the President of the Commission. (Applause)
 Mr Barroso, some commissioners will not be able to take holidays in July and August, since it will also be necessary, at this time, to closely monitor the Danish borders. I stated yesterday that perhaps we should think about introducing visas for Danes to be sent to Europe so they are better protected! Just as the European Parliament has done, you have identified the key challenges for Europe, which are food security and energy dependence. It will certainly not be possible to resolve all these issues in just six months. You will at least be able to take the credit for raising them and, as I told you when we met in Warsaw, it will be you who will lay the foundations, and I am certain that they will be solid foundations. I shall conclude by commending your determination in the management of relations with your neighbours. We have recently often discussed support for our southern neighbours, and firm policies on this issue should be developed. Relations with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, as well as with other countries like Ukraine and Belarus, in particular, are just as deserving of our attention and efforts. Mr Tusk, my group has great expectations of your political will and your leadership. I shall conclude by drawing inspiration from the words of a great Pole whom you know well, Pope John Paul II: ‘Do not be afraid, Mr Tusk: go ahead; we are with you’. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has shown how the rotating Presidency has continued to play an important role in our decision-making system. We have to recognise the importance of the advances that have been made in these last few months on a number of fronts. Firstly, there are the advances on the economic front, with the progress that has been made on governance and the success of the first-ever European Semester. Secondly, there is the common policy front, with the measures taken concerning social cohesion, the common agricultural policy, food security, the single market, the Danube strategy and, of course, energy policy. Thirdly, there is the external front, with the accession of Croatia, but also the expression of our solidarity with our Japanese friends and with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Let me inform you, Mr Orbán, of the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on most of these points. First, I want to thank the Hungarian Presidency. In particular I would thank the Minister of State for EU Affairs, our former fellow Member Mrs Győri, for the enormous efforts she has made towards taking the governance package forward and, in particular, granting Parliament’s requests for the Community method to be applied. We have been successful on 90% to 95% of our requests. I am very disappointed that, because of the stance some people have taken, we cannot reach a conclusion this week as planned. Without economic governance, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no stability for the euro. Without a stable euro, the chances of Europe winning the battle for growth, and thus the battle for employment and social cohesion, are next to nothing. The PPE Group is convinced of this. President of the Council, I also want to emphasise the progress that has been made on common policies since January. There has been progress on the cohesion policy, with the agreement reached in February on the strengthening of this device in the coming years. There has also been progress on the common agricultural policy, with the agreement reached in March on the broad outlines of the reform, against a background of worrying increases in the prices of raw materials as well as ever greater challenges in relation to food security. Thirdly, there has been progress on energy and innovation, strategic themes to which an entire meeting of the European Council was devoted at the start of February, one month before the Fukushima tragedy. Finally, there has been progress on the single market, which will be consolidated further thanks to the Single Market Act. On all these major topics, the Hungarian Presidency has made progress in spite of a difficult political and economic environment. I would add one important element to that, namely the policy on the Roma, on which you, Mr Orbán, have been able to conciliate the Europeans and propose specific actions. I am particularly grateful to you for that. I will end by mentioning the advances made in the area of external affairs. I have already had the opportunity to welcome the progress made by Croatia during the last few months; it is only because of this that the 27 were able to give it the green light for its accession in accordance with the timetable that President Orbán wished for, starting in January. This accession is good news for the Croatian people. It is also good news for the peoples of the Balkans, who must be able to rely on a concrete European perspective. The events that have occurred in the Mediterranean, too, have dominated the Presidency to a great extent. Europe has managed to give a clear demonstration of moral solidarity, but has also shown real solidarity with its southern neighbours, and it has also managed to resolve the problems that arose concerning the economic refugees who immigrated to the Italian coast. At the same time – and I am particularly happy about this – the Schengen area has been opened up to Romania and Bulgaria, not in order to do them a favour, but because they are respecting the rules that apply to everyone. This shows that European solidarity has to be earned and that effort is rewarded. I thank the Hungarian Presidency and wish all the best to the Polish Presidency. Joseph Daul,

Madam President, you know that I am always very brief. Martin, we are proper Democrats –

 Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Győri, I would firstly like to say a brief word to you, in acknowledgement of all the work you have done and especially of the methodical approach you employed and the hours you devoted to this work, with Parliament in particular. I think that is worth mentioning and so, once again, thank you. (Applause)
 You are applauding her, but it could not have been any other way: we have trained her well within our group. Therefore, she knows what Parliament is all about. Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances. Seldom have expectations been so high among the people in our various countries, expectations of brave and united decisions from their leaders on the burning issue of the euro and the debt crisis, as well as on economic governance. In several countries, and especially in Greece, our fellow citizens are confused, anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children’s future. I would like to take this opportunity to send out three messages to our Greek friends. Firstly, Europe is in solidarity with them, and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility – and I stress the word responsibility. Secondly, the situation that they – and indeed many other countries in Europe – are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means. This has to be said, and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality. My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term. This will involve making sacrifices, but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end. This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country’s twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation. Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking – that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) – or, after having expressed their concern, they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy. My group, ladies and gentlemen, is calling for a shake-up. It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial. We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves – and when I say ‘us’, I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens. This brings me back to the European Council, from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity. However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily, as they have done in the past. When the Council, with Parliament, decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States, it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity. We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with. If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past. I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that. I will conclude on a positive note, by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th Member State in a few months’ time. This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government, whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend. This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans, who are doubting themselves right now. However, the values that Europe embodies – solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity – have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else. I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro and public debt crisis demand solutions at European and not national level. This is the message that Mr Barroso, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, has been sending the Member States for months. However, a European solution means European funding. My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe, both in its objectives and its terms of reference. My question to the Council is as follows: is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s? Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable? I think not. It is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers. It has changed, and it would be irresponsible not to reflect these changes in the ways in which Europe is funded, in other words, in the way Europe is designed. (The speaker broke off, hoping to continue his speech later) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe’s new realities, trends and aims. Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe’s place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed. It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes. The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate. When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources. We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets. This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets. Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits. Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States. Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year. Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts. So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances. Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments. Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt. Europeans need to be told the truth. The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum. The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish. The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen. The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage. Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe’s capacity for influencing the world. The European Parliament – and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me – is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework. If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever. If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects. Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe. Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes. As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions – some more peaceful than others – taking place in a number of neighbouring Mediterranean countries and, more recently, by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism, namely, the end of the Bin Laden era. What is Europe’s role in all of this? Are we willingly and actively involved in the situation? Yes, we certainly are. The action being taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government has demonstrated that, when it wants to, Europe – or some of Europe – can act decisively in difficult times. Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding ‘No’. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion. Europe backed stability and development aid in the Mediterranean. Yet the people are – quite legitimately – demanding political freedom and are fleeing their countries because there is no prospect of a life of dignity and opportunity for them and their children. The humanitarian assistance that we have provided over recent months has definitely been useful. Baroness Ashton, we need to do more. Have we begun to learn from these events? I would like to think so. What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea – and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths – are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement. (Applause)
 Is all of this worthy of Europe, of European values, principles and ideals? I do not think so, nor does my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) nor, I am sure, do the majority of Members in this House. Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon. We now need to move on and take action. That entails making choices and sticking to them. What, then, are Europe’s priorities? Relations with our eastern and southern neighbours? Combating terrorism? A solution to the conflict in the Middle East? Trade policy? Tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task. Who are our preferential partners? The United States, emerging countries, or others? How can we achieve the best results? By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice? Ladies and gentlemen, an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs, security and defence: instead, we need more Europe. We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level. Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives. Ladies and gentlemen, 2011 should be the year of the Mediterranean, of combating terrorism, even of achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East conflict. If Europe is capable of becoming a key player in this area, it will be able to put the errors of its youth behind it. Let me close with a quote from someone very familiar to you: John Paul II. ‘Do not be afraid,’ Baroness Ashton. We have made savings of EUR 4 billion in the European budget. Please come up with some proposals for using that money, rather than returning it to the Member States. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentleman, the last European Council has set our countries on the right track. By increasing the capacity of the Solidarity Fund and deciding to make it permanent, the 27 have once again demonstrated their commitment to the euro and the importance they place on solidarity between the more financially stable countries and those facing temporary difficulties. At the same time, the decision to seal a euro pact between eurozone countries, and further afield, is indicative of the political will of European leaders to draw lessons from the financial crisis. The fact that we share a currency forces us to be more coherent in our economic and social choices. The time when countries could set an atypical rate of taxation or specific social rules without first consulting their partners is long gone. The reason for this is simple: all countries should benefit from the solidarity of their eurozone partners. Yet our people will only accept this solidarity if they think that everyone is putting the same effort into managing public funds. In this respect, the euro pact is a major step forwards towards the convergence of our economies. My group strongly supports it, but demands – and I shall continue to demand – that it is implemented in the context of the Community method, under the auspices of the Commission, Mr President. You are taking the right steps, you have done some good work, but more needs to be done within this Community method under the auspices of the Commission. That is how we will build Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, you know how stubborn I can be and I will repeat it as many times as necessary here so that no one forgets. Europe sets itself apart from the rest of the world with its model of the social market economy, a model which our fellow citizens are quite rightly proud of and which is based on the principle of solidarity, but one which is difficult to preserve in the face of globalisation. The question is knowing how to ensure its future is sustainable by striking a happy medium between the nanny state favoured by socialists, which we have seen almost bankrupt us, and that of excessive liberalism, the dangers of which we have seen with the financial crisis. Three things are needed to achieve this. Firstly, all our countries need to reduce their deficit; secondly, they need to adopt comparable budgetary, fiscal and social rules; and, thirdly, they need to invest together in innovation to boost growth, which to date is clearly inadequate. Indeed, we can only preserve and strengthen our model if we invest in growth sectors: green energy, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, and so on. Given our limited financial room for manoeuvre, the best way to meet the growth challenge and achieve economies of scale is to pool our skills as well as our capital. Without massive investment in innovation, without a genuine European plan, we are denying ourselves the ability to keep up with our competitors. Ladies and gentlemen, while our Heads of State or Government were meeting, 10 days ago, the Fukushima power station continued to be an issue of global concern and the insurgents in Libya were looking to Europe for strong action. On these two matters, our countries and the European Union have shown a great sense of responsibility. We have in fact offered Japan our nuclear expertise in what is an extremely difficult and worrying situation for that country, and also for the international community at large. There will no doubt be a pre-Fukushima and a post-Fukushima. Although unfortunately not there yet, my group wants the post-Fukushima to be a period of reflection and action, firstly to ensure that the rules governing nuclear safety are significantly tightened and, secondly, to further our efforts in the field of green energy. I agree with your approach to Côte d'Ivoire, Mr President. Turning lastly to the Mediterranean, I welcome the European Council’s repeated call for Colonel Gaddafi to relinquish power, allowing for a new page in this country’s history. What I want is for all our countries to come together and discuss a neighbourhood policy as ambitious and successful for the South as the one they were able to make in the 1990s for the East. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would simply like to tell Mr Cohn-Bendit that, in order to challenge a seat, an official proposal must firstly be made. If no proposal is made, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot analyse the situation. Before intervening in this way, I suggest that you think before you act. That is all. (Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit: ‘Yes, but he might not have a seat’)
 You are the one asking me to observe the law. I have always observed the law. Now let us leave it to the Committee on Legal Affairs to give its verdict. It cannot give its verdict without a proposal. If that proposal is not lawful, the Committee on Legal Affairs will tell us. Let me say again: let us think before we act. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is preparing to meet for the second week running amid a climate of international uncertainty and tensions. There is the uncertainty in Japan, where the level of human loss is still difficult to determine, and uncertainty in the Mediterranean, as further populations rise up against their regimes, in Bahrain and as you mentioned President-in-Office of the Council, in Yemen. Inevitably, all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe. Our fellow citizens have witnessed Japan’s drama unfolding live. On top of the empathy we feel for the thousands of families shattered by grief, as we speak there are fears associated with the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the dread of the dangers that we too could face in a similar or comparable situation. These events should certainly be taken on board by all countries that have nuclear power plants and it is good that this Parliament is organising a debate on nuclear safety, though we should not lose sight of the fact that in Europe we need to be increasing and not reducing our energy independence. This is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session. This weekend, the 27 Heads of State or Government will also be discussing the UN decision to intervene in Libya to save the insurgents from imminent attack by the regime. I would like to highlight the fact that European States have taken the initiative in these operations and were the first to intervene within the framework of the UN mandate, which itself was the initiative of several European States. No doubt they heard what us MEPs said during our last part-session here in Brussels. My group would like to see the Council take this opportunity to further develop the EU’s Mediterranean strategy, whilst maintaining the goal to help and support but never to impose. This is our duty as neighbours. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following last week’s euro area summit, at which the groundwork was done, the Council’s flagship measures this week will relate to strengthening the euro and making progress on economic governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of increasing the funds available to support the euro and of making the ad hoc instrument we adopted last year to help Greece and Ireland more permanent. This political will reflects the responsible attitude that Member States have taken in managing this unprecedented crisis in our single currency’s history. However, we wish to stress very strongly that these exceptional circumstances that the loss of control of national public finances has brought about must not be seen by the Council as an opportunity to adopt a different method for managing European affairs. The Community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception. A very strong majority within Parliament supports this principle and the Barroso Commission also supports us in this approach, quite simply because it is vital for the future of the European Union. I am sure that President Van Rompuy will succeed in persuading the Heads of State or Government of this. The Pact for the euro should also be adopted on Friday. We welcome it insofar as it introduces provisions for which we have been calling for months now, namely convergence between Member States’ budgetary, social and fiscal policies. I cannot stress this enough: European solidarity will only be accepted by our citizens if they feel it is fair and deserved. This will only be the case if the working conditions are met and if our businesses can invest and recruit under comparable fiscal conditions. Lastly, our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament’s position as co-legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion. Europe must get back on the path of growth and employment, and the measures that are taking shape are a step in this direction. Provided they are planned within a Community framework, they will give Europe a healthy basis for a fresh start and a promising future. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal. Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments – all the amendments – requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members. Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts. The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament. My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world? Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law? (Applause)
 In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes? The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality. Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores? (Applause)
 Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same. The credibility of Parliament is at stake. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what lessons have we learnt from the financial crisis? The lesson we learnt from the Second World War was that our nations should work together and stop tearing each other apart. From the fall of the Berlin Wall, we learnt lessons about authoritarian and communist regimes and we were able to reunite our continent around the values of freedom, democracy and the social market economy. From the terrorist attack of 11 September, we learnt that we had to strike a new balance between security and freedom. From this financial crisis, the lesson we must learn is for our Member States to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary, fiscal and social fields. I know exactly how far we have come. The establishment, this year, of cooperation between the 27 on their budgetary priorities constitutes, in itself, a major shift in attitude. The regulations that we have provided ourselves with to make the financial markets more ethical are, also, exemplary, but they do not suffice. My group would like to call for an agreement to be reached between Parliament and the Council, before the summer, on strengthened economic governance. My group would also like to call for efforts to be pursued on the coordination of social and fiscal matters. That is the thrust of the competitiveness pact, the initial version of which has already been revised to be in greater accordance with Community values. However, we must go even further still and ensure that both Parliament and the Commission exercise all the prerogatives that they enjoy in this respect, and in this, we are counting on the President of the Commission. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes and supports these proposals as did the national leaders of the party in Helsinki. Ladies and gentlemen, how can we explain to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as we are in a delicate financial situation in mid-July each year, most of our Member States should continue to spend as if nothing were amiss? How can it be that the over-indebtedness of our States is more acceptable, more tolerable and more bearable than that of households or businesses? I have witnessed this at company level. The crisis has led to job losses and family trauma; the least we can do is to learn lessons from this and tell things as they are. The first lesson is that we should no longer treat lightly the obligations placed on States – whatever their size – to respect budget limits. The second lesson is this: European solidarity can only operate if, and only if, our social and fiscal regulations are at least comparable. They do not necessarily need to be identical – just comparable. At the moment, this is far from being the case. The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy. The fourth and final lesson is that even in a storm, Europe is standing firm and European integration is becoming stronger. Our American and Japanese partners have debt ratios far in excess of ours, without, it must be said, being excessively worried by it. However, that will probably not always be the case. For our part, now is the time to consolidate our economy and our competitiveness. Now is the time to work on creating jobs for the future. Now is the time to tell things as they are. Let us not miss this opportunity! Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there is something that I do not understand. Last week, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we would be holding a debate on Russia in March because Baroness Ashton would be present. Secondly, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we needed to organise a debate on Russia because Mr Putin was going to visit the Commission, or rather Mr Barroso. According to the information I have received this afternoon, Mr Putin is not coming to see the Commission. Do you have any information on this issue? The debate was requested last week only because Mr Putin was coming. However, a debate on Russia, together with a resolution, is still scheduled for March. I should now like to receive some information concerning what we discussed. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what will the European public take away from the meeting of its leaders this Friday in Brussels? Will it understand that European responses to European challenges – the euro, energy, research and innovation and employment – are being sought in good faith? Or rather that, once again, we are surrendering to the sorry spectacle of division and power struggles? What headlines will the major newspapers run? What will people be talking about on Saturday in blogs and on Facebook when they refer to the European Council’s decisions? About the timidity of Europe when faced with the situation of Mediterranean countries which long to have their rights respected, or, on the contrary, about its leadership? Europe’s duty in this regard is quite clear: it must harness all its resources and all its diplomatic skills to aid the transition and the organisation of democratic and open elections. Ladies and gentlemen, as far as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the solution to our problems lies in having more Europe, not less. The solution does not lie in more so-called national victories, but in more common victories and more coordinated responses. The solution does not lie in a lax attitude towards applying our common rules, but in greater discipline. The solution, ladies and gentlemen, does not lie in greater divergences between our budgets, our labour laws and our taxation rates, but in greater convergence. As far as the PPE Group is concerned, there is but one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, which is that, without a common vision and without shared resources, our countries will sink into sluggish growth and plunge into social crisis. If there is just one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is that, by thinking, working and investing as Europeans, our countries will emerge from the difficult patch they are going through and will be forever stronger for it. What else will make us react as one if not the difficulties that we have just experienced? Together with the European Commission, the majority of my colleagues in this House and, I am sure, the majority of the 500 million Europeans, I put the following question to the European Council: when are we going to act and react more as one? As for the euro, I now know that that our governments will hold fast and will not allow speculators to destroy 60 years of European integration. I now call on them to concentrate on the consolidation of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, as this is essential. I call on them in particular to strengthen their budgetary discipline and to keep up their efforts to reduce public debt. European governance is the sine qua non
 of the success of our common project. My group supports it as much as it supports the euro, that is to say, totally. The solution to our problems, as I said at the beginning of my speech, is to have more Europe, not less. While this is true in the cases of employment and the economy, it is also true for energy, a topic which the Council will also cover on Friday. Having more Europe means, first and foremost, fully implementing the laws that already exist in relation to the internal energy market. It can never be emphasised enough that making this market fully operational will make us more competitive, will ensure the security of our supplies and will guarantee a substantial increase in renewable energy production. Having more Europe also means encouraging our States to meet the challenge of increasing their energy efficiency by 20% between now and 2020. They were the ones that set themselves this objective. We must ensure that they reach it, or else we shall have to raise the standards they have to meet to do so. Finally, having more Europe in the field of energy means investing more. The Commission estimates that it will cost EUR 1 billion to reach the required infrastructure level. We expect ambitious decisions from the European Council in order to achieve this. Europe needs secure, clean energy just as much as it needs a research and development policy and a policy for promoting industrial innovation. Here too, the solution lies in having more Europe and paying more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The solution lies in reducing bureaucracy to a minimum and finally reaching an agreement on a European patent. In the area of innovation, too, we expect common solutions from our leaders, not parochial squabbles. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to move on from our knee-jerk reactions of the past. Promoting our differences is all well and good, but making them mutually complementary is even better. Taking individual initiatives can be useful, but playing as a team is the way to win the match. Harbouring national ambitions is perfectly legitimate, but understanding that the game is won at international level by playing as a team is the way to guarantee a future for the people of Europe. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the last European Council clearly showed that the euro is a vital pillar of European integration. Everything possible must be done to stabilise and strengthen it. Our Heads of State or Government have since confirmed their deep attachment to the European currency and the fact that Estonia is joining the euro area at the beginning of this year is yet another signal in this direction, as well as setting a very good example of how to respect standards to the major countries that fail to respect them. That said, no one underestimates the seriousness of what Europe is going through economically and socially within the euro area. Everything possible must be done in 2011 to overcome these problems and to reassure the markets, not superficially but structurally, in other words, by creating the right conditions for growth and employment in the long term. I think we are speaking the same language on this issue. Firstly, this means that national public finances must be restored to better health. Push hard for this, let us not give in! Secondly, it means that the Member States must get their fiscal policies to converge more closely, and also their taxation and social policies. It also means that we must come to a swift agreement on the euro area bail-out fund and that this fund only makes sense if it is backed up by strict enforcement of the fiscal discipline rules. Our citizens must know that the countries they are assisting in difficult circumstances are keeping a very strong check on their public accounts; otherwise, they will no longer agree to stump up, if I may put it that way. Finally, as I said, we must create the conditions for growth and employment. That also implies completing the European internal market, investing more in research and innovation, and in lifelong education and training. My group wants the EU approach to be promoted over the intergovernmental approach in all these areas, quite simply because it is far more effective and far more sustainable. Mr Van Rompuy, I call on you to ensure that reform of the Treaty, confirmed at the last European Council, be concluded as soon and as swiftly as possible. The budget debate is only just beginning. My group will continue to call for a thorough review of European public finances in forthcoming years, with the aim of once again creating the conditions for growth and employment in Europe. Mr Barroso, let us scrutinise everything, let us not be afraid and, as I have already said several times, let us take two or three different examples of budgets: for example, how can we pull Europe out of its current situation with 1%, 2% or 5%? We will not succeed by reducing resources. If we want to create jobs, we need more European resources, and this does not mean that the Member States have to spend more money. Let us not be afraid, President van Rompuy and President Barroso. Put these proposals to us and we, the Heads of State or Government, as well as Parliament, will be forced to find the right solution – but at least let us have a number of options from which to choose.

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, rarely will the Presidency of the Council of Ministers have had to face so many challenges: the challenge of the euro, which we must stabilise, the challenge of employment, which is experiencing stronger growth and therefore a more efficient economy, the challenge of energy independence and food security, while prices for raw materials are rising alarmingly. I have no doubt that the Hungarian Presidency will be able to deal with these challenges, alongside the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Mr Orbán, you have won the confidence of your electorate in Hungary. Your party, Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége (FIDESZ), is based on an idea, on an ideal, on a value: that of liberty and democracy. Since your election, you have, with the Hungarian Parliament, undertaken a whole series of reforms which your people have called for by democratically giving you a large majority. Today, one of those reforms – the one concerning the media – is the subject of legal scrutiny by the European Commission, guardian of the Treaties. You yourself stated last week – and I thank you for doing so – during your talks with Mr Barroso, and since then, that were this law incompatible with European law, you would submit it to your parliament for the necessary changes. I have complete faith in your word. For my part, I, like you, have confidence in the European Commission, which plays its role as guardian of the Treaties, and I also have confidence that you will respect the letter and the spirit of the European rules. Prime Minister Orbán, we have known each other for a long time and I consider you a very great European. For my part, I have no reason to doubt that you will do what you have said with regard to the media law and to the other priorities faced by your Presidency. I now come to those priorities, beginning with the first: the stability of Europe. Perhaps it is a good thing that the two presidencies of the Council that will follow one another in 2011 will be assumed by countries that do not belong to the euro area but which wish to join it in the very near future. Indeed, both Hungary and Poland are both entitled to join it. They therefore have a stake in ensuring the stability of this currency. I repeat: the only effective way of ending the speculative attacks against the euro and of strengthening the fundamentals of the European economy is to restore order to our public finances. This involves stronger coordination of fiscal and social policies in our countries, as is quite rightly provided for by the new budgetary period for the European Semester. It also depends on greater flexibility in our employment market and greater productivity. Like the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) firmly believes that the future of 500 million Europeans depends on a stronger, more united and more coherent Europe. It depends on having more of a Europe and certainly not less of a Europe. Mr Orbán, we need European economic governance. We need more communitarianism and I am sure that you will work towards this. President-in-Office of the Council, you have defined the setting up of a common energy policy as one of your main priorities. I think you are right. Mr Buzek, our President, has also, quite rightly, made it one of the strengths of his Presidency. I agree with you on this point, but I also want to warn you about the terribly worrying consequences that may result from the increase in the prices of all kinds of raw materials which has been particularly sharp over the last few months. We have already seen the social implications in several Mediterranean countries of such a price rise in basic foodstuffs, especially for the poorest countries. I hope that Europe will take this problem seriously and deal forcefully with speculators. I also hope that the Hungarian Presidency – I thought that the Group of the Greens were going to be silent, but I can hear them talking; it is not right, people should be quiet all the way through – will back the Commission in its assistance to Tunisia, which is going through a crucial time and must be supported as it moves towards change. Mr Orbán, you know that to succeed in your mandate and help Europe through its current difficult phase, you need the confidence of Parliament. In December, when we were in a difficult position with regard to the Council, you had the courage to sign the first-rate letters for us which really helped Parliament to approve its budget. Thank you, already, for what you did in December! Even before January, you included the political groups when defining your priorities, and naturally chose Mrs Győri, one of our very fine former colleagues, as Minister for EU Affairs. These are all positive signs which, I have no doubt, will be accompanied by a perfect balance between the reforms you are undertaking and the European values that every one of us here defends.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council, which opens this week, is taking place in a particular context: speculative attacks against the euro, the revival of euroscepticism and the beginning of reflections on Europe’s finances, while this Parliament is preparing to vote on the 2011 budget. These are, of course, closely linked. The euro crisis and the solidarity measures have an impact on the purchasing power of the European people, who are wondering if all these efforts are worthwhile, if they are leading to anything, whence the euroscepticism even in countries hitherto traditionally pro-European. This is a phenomenon hijacked by populist and extremist political factions, which feed on fear and the temptation to withdraw into oneself and which, when they are in government, do not have a miracle cure. I will start with the euro, which we must protect and strengthen while, at the same time, asking ourselves some fundamental questions. My first question is this: has Europe ever had a currency as stable as the euro? I say this to those nostalgic for national currencies: a step back would have catastrophic consequences for Europe. My second question is: who is behind the attacks to which the euro has been subjected for months? Who is standing to gain from the crime, if I may call it that? I am not a conspiracy theorist but, in my conversations with political leaders and financial analysts, the paths are converging on the source of our problems. When will we learn? I think we can talk directly to our friends. My third question is this: why is the euro still trading above USD 1.30? This is seriously hampering our exports and everyone is saying that the euro has had it. Why are our countries the only ones to practise a strict policy of orthodoxy while our competitors profit from their weak currencies to boost their economies? This is what our citizens are asking us. These are questions I have been asked in the last two weeks in meetings with elected politicians. Ladies and gentlemen, what we need is a message of confidence that we will overcome the crisis, measures to encourage a return to growth and concrete measures like those taken recently by the Barroso Commission to relaunch the internal market or to make the financial markets more ethical. What we need, and the euro crisis proved this, is convergence in our social and fiscal policies. That takes courage. President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, go further and faster and we will solve quite a few problems. We are going to need a lot of courage in the years to come if we want to strengthen our countries in the arena of global competition and if we want to use taxpayers’ money in the most effective way possible. This effort to streamline expenditure must be made at all levels: local, regional, national and European. The political and financial priorities of the Union need to be reexamined and the public finances of Europe need to be fundamentally reviewed. We need to ask ourselves the real questions and, depending on the answers we give, adapt our budgetary framework for the period 2014-2020. It is for this crucial debate that the European Parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that, as the representatives directly elected by 500 million Europeans, we intend to fully participate, even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right. I ask the European Council to give us its agreement and, if necessary, to vote, so that those who deny us this opportunity to participate in the debate assume their responsibilities. It is not, for us, about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction. We must lance the boil, we must take the right decisions, the necessary decisions to ensure that the European budget increasingly becomes an investment budget. If our Member States, mindful of budgetary constraints, can invest less in education, training, research and innovation, let us do so at European level by combining our resources and, therefore, by achieving economies of scale. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the debate on Europe’s finances must not be allowed to descend into a quarrel between Member States who want their money back. On the contrary, the debate should be about reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe by exposing them to the added value that concerted and visionary European action can represent. I am currently visiting the capital cities and I can tell you that the debate is taking hold. Do not miss this opportunity. Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end, I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament, as well as José Manuel Barroso, who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June. I believe that we must continue, together, in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us. We have to show them the way. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an opinion poll I read yesterday in a newspaper states that 70% of French people believe that they are still in the midst of a crisis and that it has not yet been resolved. I am sure that a broader survey in Europe would generate the same results. We must therefore address our citizens’ valid concerns. They are living in difficult times and cannot tolerate the slow and complex decision-making process at European and global level. Many of these people have also asked me what we are doing and what Europe is doing for them and their family. People are scared. At the same time, I see that more and more politicians and more and more countries, even in this House, are using, manipulating and exploiting this fear and this anxiety and do not have any proposals. This populist approach, which is corrupting our policy, is serious, and I should like to mention here that this is not the way to resolve the real and serious problems facing our countries and Europe in the world. I believe that it is up to the political parties and the parliamentary groups that are against such populism and demagogy to speak out more. No, the answer to the crisis is not to shy away from it or resort to protectionism. No, there is no fast or easy solution to the crisis we are facing. No, it is not possible to turn our back on solidarity or on efforts to strengthen all our countries in the face of globalisation and then realise, in the end, that we need partners when times are tough. We must learn some lessons from what is happening in Ireland, and this is not a criticism of Ireland, President of the Council, President of the Commission. We must learn lessons, because the difficulties that that country is facing are due not only to the banks but also to the current government’s fiscal and economic policy over the years. The Celtic Tiger, which was solely responsible for its own growth, with an atypical tax system, minimal banking regulation and an investment code unlike that of any other country in the European Union, is today witnessing a collapse of its property bubble, household debt, record unemployment and a crippled banking sector. The Irish Government has guaranteed the whole banking system, committing EUR 480 billion, or three times its GDP, which increases its public deficit to 32%. Today, the Irish Government has called for and rightly obtained European solidarity. I welcome this and, as Commissioner Rehn said in this very Parliament on Monday, the aid Ireland should soon receive will safeguard the stability of the whole euro area. Yet has this European solidarity, which Dublin is rightly receiving today, as it did when it joined the EU, been shown over the years by the Irish Government itself? How many times have Member States tried to align taxation – a prerequisite, as is all too evident today, for good governance of the euro? And every time the same few countries oppose it. I am not pointing the finger at anyone, but I believe that it is time for us to learn from such behaviour for the future. As I have said several times in this House, a crisis signifies an opportunity for change, and we must not be afraid to change some of our customs, which have not had the positive effect we were counting on. Ladies and gentlemen, the measures adopted by the European Council a few weeks ago and the guidelines agreed at the G20 in Seoul represent a step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. In other words, there needs to be an awareness of the need for cooperation in Europe and among major regional blocs in order to address the instability of financial markets and trade imbalances and also to avoid a currency war. We all know that, on all these issues, our countries alone will be unable to find a viable long-term solution to meet the expectations of the 500 million Europeans, who, as I said at the beginning, are expecting their politicians – that is to say all of us here and back home in our capitals – to make forward-looking decisions. President of the Council, if the crisis has taught us anything, it is that yesterday’s solutions are not necessarily those of tomorrow. We are paying a high price realising this in a time of crisis, but we will pay an even higher price if we continue to ignore it. I call on the European institutions and the governments of our Member States to change, to learn political lessons from the crisis, and to stop seeking solidarity only when it is too late. Mr President, I would like to add one last thing. This is not a question of the Council and Parliament fighting against one another; it is a question of implementing the treaties, of showing solidarity, and of working hand in hand. This is the message I should like to get across to you so that we might overcome the crisis for the sake of our fellow citizens. Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 I cannot accept what you said. We live in a democratic age and under a democratic system. I would ask you to make an official apology, or else we are going to make a formal complaint. There are people who have said less than that – it is not right. (Applause)

 Mr President, if I may, what I said this morning is that Mr Bloom has behaved unacceptably. Secondly, we are in a democratic parliament. We have decided democratically, Mr Bloom, that you should leave this Parliament. I hereby ask you, in the name of democracy and of all this Parliament stands for, to leave this Parliament today. I ask you to do so out of respect for democratic rights. Mr Gollnisch, you do not need to challenge me. We know your methods. They are unacceptable, anti-democratic. That is all I have to say to you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last Conference of Presidents, we decided to put the Matera report on today’s agenda. No one asked for that report not to be put on the agenda. Therefore, the question asked by the President is as follows: faced with an individual such as this, are we going to be able to have frank discussions, as we have been used to having for five years? That is the question I am going to ask on Thursday morning. Moreover, if the European Conservatives and Reformists continue to make this person participate in the Conference of Presidents, we are going to change the way we work. That is all I have to say. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the budget comes at a time when our fellow citizens are having doubts because of the weakness of their currency and when Europe is rightly rallying in support of the Irish economy. Contrary to what may have been said about the European Parliament’s objectives in these negotiations, this is not about power struggles or institutional disputes, nor is it about ignoring the difficulties faced by our Member States or the public debt crisis from which we are all suffering. No, it is about ensuring that Europe can honour its commitments. Commitments in the social sphere, and here I am thinking of education and lifelong learning; commitments to the victims of natural disasters, and here I am thinking of assistance for countries affected by food riots; and commitments to programmes that create jobs and growth, such as Galileo and ITER. The reality is that, by looking at things from an accounting point of view rather than from a political point of view, the few Member States that continue to block the negotiations are harming the interests of the 500 million Europeans. By making the European Parliament out to be the villain of the piece, and by suggesting that it wants to spend at a time when the Member States are tightening their belts, that it wants to exercise the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon to the detriment of saving and of Europeans, they are diverting attention from the reality of the problems that exist. What is that reality? It is that the latest economic forecasts offer no hope of a return, by 2020, to the strong, sustainable and inclusive growth that the European Union set itself as an objective. It is also a fact that the current draft budget makes no provision for the financing of the new powers conferred on the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon and fails to fulfil our requests to proceed with the mid-term review of the financial cycle laid down in the 2007-2013 agreement. Lastly, it is a fact that the draft budget makes no – and I mean no – financial provision for the 2020 strategy. In short, the Council is adopting programmes without making any financial provision for them. Moreover, when the President of the European Parliament reminds it of its obligations, it takes offence, but when a local, regional or national authority approves projects without financing them, that authority is condemned. Why, I ask you, would something that is unacceptable at local or national level be acceptable at European level? Is this a way of reconciling our citizens with Europe? I do not think so. I say clearly to the Commission and, above all, to the Council: do not count on my group, do not count on this House voting for programmes that do not have guaranteed funding. My group wants a return to common sense and a balanced agreement to be reached. It must be a comprehensive agreement that relates, at the same time, to the 2011 budget, the 2010 amending budget and its associated letters of amendment, the flexibility procedure and, finally, the guarantees regarding the financing of future policies, which we call the political section. I would stress that our proposals on this political section do not involve any changes to the current treaties, nor do they anticipate in any way the amount, origin or distribution of future EU funds. I would also stress that reopening the debate on own resources is not a new proposal by Parliament, but a decision taken by the Council itself in May 2006, following the agreement reached in December 2005 under the UK Presidency. My group fully supports the objective not only of capping but also of reducing the Member States’ budget contributions. Indeed, the extremely serious nature of the debt crisis must lead to a complete overhaul of European public finances. This is not just about dividing up tasks between national budgets and European budgets; it is also about seeking out all possible forms of mutualisation in order to make savings. Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the two demands made by the Council on 15 October: for the EU budget to contribute to common financial discipline and for the funding of European objectives to be guaranteed. That is all we are aiming for in the negotiations on the 2011 budget, and we are confident that an agreement can be reached if the Council Presidency negotiates effectively with its colleagues in Brussels. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common thread between the meetings of the European Council and the G20 is the need to make the necessary adaptations after the financial crisis. For the European Union, these adaptations consist of putting our respective national and EU public finances in order and protecting our currency, the euro, by consolidating it internally and defending its value against the other major currencies. The European Council will be dominated by discussions on Europe’s economic and financial governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the initial lines that the Van Rompuy task force has taken, including the plans for a system of sanctions against Member States that do not adhere to the criteria of the Stability Pact. However, there is still more work to be done, with more Community method and less intergovernmental method. I welcome the work that the Commission has done along these lines. I would ask the Council to remember that this Parliament is now colegislator and will play a full role in defining the forthcoming reforms. The more Parliament is brought on board in the early stages, the more chance we have of achieving a satisfactory and timely outcome. I call on President Van Rompuy to heed this message. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must make its voice heard in the debate on relative currency values, and the European Council must establish our position on the subject next week, before the Seoul G20 summit. Europe must join with its partners, in particular, the United States, in reminding the emerging countries of their responsibilities. Currency dumping and the social consequences it entails must no longer be allowed. Three major subjects will be on the table at the Seoul Summit: reform of the international monetary system of course, but also the stability of commodities – especially food and energy – and global governance. Europe has a message to deliver on each of these subjects, but this message will only be credible if we put in place effective internal, Community-wide instruments to govern and manage our public finances. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to influence global governance and will not really have a place on the international stage unless we can make the often unpopular effort to clean up our finances and unless we stick to our priorities of combating climate change and development policy. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, yesterday evening, my group discussed amendments that the services have told us are unacceptable. As a result, and following the discussion I had this morning with the heads of delegation and the group leaders, I request that the vote on the calendar be postponed. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget is the first budget that this Parliament is called on to negotiate and vote on using its new powers under the Treaty of Lisbon. It is the first in which we have desisted from calling for any increase in the global volume proposed by the Commission, instead preferring a realistic and political approach. A realistic approach insofar as our Member States have been called upon to make unprecedented efforts in stabilising and reducing their public finances. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the first to call upon them to do so. The reduction in public expenditure is, effectively, the prerequisite if our economies are to become more competitive and face up to international competition under favourable conditions. It is therefore not a question of our asking of the twenty-seven, for this budgetary year, expenditure which does not fit within the efforts made by our fellow citizens within their own national framework. However, our approach is also political insofar as we believe that the 2011 budget cannot be disassociated from the more general financial context of the years to come and, in particular, from the perspective of the next 2014-2020 financial cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, if there is an objective that our Parliament must aim for in the course of this legislature, it is to ensure that European policies are funded in a manner commensurate with what is at stake. It is not necessarily a question of asking for more money but rather to ensure that the tasks assigned to the European Union can be achieved with adequate funding. Our States can even economise, reduce their contribution to the Community budget, if they are prepared for Europe to change its financial system, as it is now obsolete, and take advantage of own resources. A euro spent at European level is, indeed, more profitable, more productive than a euro spent at national level, because a European euro does not have a deficit to cover. At national level, the euro is now worth only half or less in some countries. At national level too, this euro which has not already been reduced comes back in the shape of cohesion funds, funds for rural development and for promoting innovation. I request that the Council gives serious consideration to this new approach to European finance. I am grateful to Commissioner Lewandowski for already having opened this debate with our ministers of finance. Europeans have the right to know what their public authorities spend, whether these be local, regional, national or European. Member States must be ready to lift this gauntlet. President of the Council, Ministers, you have in your own hands the key to unlocking these debates and negotiations so that all the Member States can move forward, so that the euro that is at the level of Brussels can return to the level of the citizens in the Member States and be much more productive and create new jobs at a European level. I beg you, the opportunity is still there. As a Christmas present, you must tell us that the own funds and own resources of Europe are starting to be the subject of serious discussion and serious negotiation under your Presidency. I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this.Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report sends a clear message: the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy. The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes. A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world. Culture is a significant asset. It contributes to a living and long-lasting democracy. Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society. Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union’s success for the Mediterranean. It leads nations to share and interact with one another, respect and better understand each other every day.

Mr President, the European Union has finally imposed sanctions on Syria. Unfortunately, however, it appears to have done so with some trepidation, taking care to avoid calling the head of the Syrian regime into question. This lack of determination and clarity is obviously interpreted by the demonstrators as a form of abandonment and by the authorities as an indulgence enabling them to step up their repression, a repression so cruel that it is unimaginable that Syria may be elected to sit on the UN’s Human Rights Council when the country’s authorities are right now refusing UN observers access to the city of Deraa, the scene of terrible violence against unarmed civilians. Having Syria on the Human Rights Council would be an insult to the victims and their families, and an encouragement for that regime to use brute force against its own people, with complete disregard for the values that the Human Rights Council is supposed to uphold. So, Baroness Ashton, what diplomatic options do you have in mind in order to avoid such a disaster? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I supported this resolution because I am convinced that the European Union’s desire to bolster its presence within international organisations is entirely legitimate. European citizens, through our governments, have given a legal personality and specific powers to the Union. European integration has built on a set of fundamental values that are constantly being extended. We have a duty to coordinate our activities and to promote the unity of our Union, as we have already done in the World Trade Organisation. More work remains to be done. However, there are some encouraging signs. The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools (appointment of a High Representative, creation of the European External Action Service). With its newly improved status, the Union will now be able to express its position within the United Nations General Assembly. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report provides a good overview of the current state of relations between the European Union and Iceland. Ever since the Treaty of Paris, we have maintained friendly, close and cooperative links with that country. It has been hard hit by the economic, financial and banking crisis. Reforms must be undertaken, and we must encourage them. Since the start of the accession process, we have begun an open and constructive dialogue with the Icelandic Government, which has also expressed a desire to join the euro area. Enlargement to include Iceland will allow for greater European policy coherence in the Arctic region, especially where fisheries, maritime transport, scientific research and environmental conservation are concerned. However, Europe is not a crutch or a cure for an economic crisis. It is up to Iceland to clearly subscribe to a genuine project of integration with the rest of Europe. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 We need to rethink our policy on the Southern Mediterranean. The European Neighbourhood Policy was supposed to promote the values of democracy and human rights, yet the events that have been taking place in the Southern Mediterranean since the start of the year show that we failed on that score. Admittedly, cooperation in areas such as education and modernisation of the economy has borne fruit. The same cannot be said of good governance, judicial reform and democracy, which are nonetheless headline objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This text has the merit of proposing solutions for radically rethinking this policy. I hope that the European Commission and the Council will be able to take inspiration from it.

The resolution on the situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen rightly denounces the brutal and murderous repression whose victims are the demonstrators in Syria, as well as those in Yemen and Bahrain. The leaders of these three countries are giving orders to fire on their own people, who are legitimately demanding political freedom, human dignity and social fairness. Through this resolution, the European Parliament is strongly expressing its solidarity with the Syrian, Bahraini and Yemeni citizens, who are showing great courage in demonstrating their aspirations while faced with government forces who are opening fire on unarmed civilians.

 I voted in favour of this text on migratory flows. Indeed, the events that our southern neighbours are currently going through are resulting in high levels of migration to European shores. Now more than ever, we have to coordinate our foreign and immigration policies. This is a truly European issue and now is not the time for national egoism. The Mediterranean countries of the European Union should not have to cope alone with the large influx of illegal migrants: this effort should be shared by all EU countries. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament’s clear position. We encourage the Commission to fight violence against women. Of course, there are preventive and repressive legal mechanisms in all the Member States. However, it is also the responsibility of Europe to take up this issue, which falls within its remit. It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis. Dominique Baudis,

 Mr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels, Mrs Brantner and Mrs Jäätteenmäki, with whom we prepared these amendments. Thanks to the amendments, we have a report that fully accounts for the events taking place in the Gulf, and which states very clearly Parliament’s position on the repression afflicting that region. The first amendment, 16th new citation, is as follows: ‘- having regard to the declarations by the High Representative of 10, 15 and 17 March, and the Council conclusions of 21 March on Bahrain and underlining in this context its full support for the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to peacefully demonstrate,’ This is the first amendment, and it is of course the English-language version, which has been distributed, that is deemed authentic.

The second amendment, recital A, is as follows: ‘Whereas current EU-GCC relations require constant reviewing and updating in view of recent important and rapidly unfolding developments on the ground, which are evolving rapidly, at the heart of which needs to be the pursuit of human rights and democracy.’ Dominique Baudis,  (PPE

 A new recital A bis: ‘A bis. Whereas demonstrators have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations in several GCC States; whereas the violent reaction of the authorities to the protests in Bahrain resulted in deaths, injuries and imprisonments; whereas Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti troops have arrived in the country under the banner of the GCC to participate in the repression of demonstrators,’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 – (FR)
 In paragraph 7, after the first paragraph, the first indent should now read: ‘- ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, with special regard to the freedom of speech and of assembly and the right to demonstrate peacefully, and to listen to and take into account the legitimate demands of protesters as well as to ensure their security;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7a: ‘7a. Calls on all Member States in the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognise a continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region, and calls for the full engagement with emerging civil society groups to promote a process of genuine peaceful democratic transition, within their own countries, with partners in the region and with the full support of the European Union;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7b: ʻ7b. Expresses its deep concern at the violent response of and the use of force against protesters by Bahraini authorities and at the participation of foreign troops under the GCC banner in the repression of demonstrators; whereas this stands in stark contrast to the GCC’s support for the protection of the citizens demanding freedom and democracy in Libya; calls for an immediate end to violence against peaceful protesters and for a political dialogue that can lead to further necessary political reforms in the country;ʼ Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 A new paragraph 18a: ‘18a. Takes note of the declaration by the GCC of 7 March 2011 in Abu Dhabi, which states that “the Ministerial council demands that the Security Council takes the steps necessary to protect civilians, including a no-fly zone in Libya”, which declaration has contributed to the decision of the Arab League and then the United Nations Security Council to pronounce themselves in favour of such a zone;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it expresses the solidarity of the people of Europe with Japan. Parliament is highlighting the courage of the Japanese in this crisis, the most serious since the Second World War, which has so severely affected their country. Among Japan’s friends, Europeans have immediately reported themselves for duty to lend a helping hand to the people afflicted. However, the archipelago is faced with a nuclear problem that is of extreme concern and requires our full attention. It suits Europe to provide all its assistance and expertise to the Japanese authorities in order to prevent a catastrophe of the devastating consequences of which we are unfortunately all too well aware.

 Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for their collaboration. As you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Our work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world. Since then, we have observed everywhere – including in the Gulf – powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. However, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report – and the amendments adopted in committee – raised all the issues that are behind the uprising. We condemn all forms of discrimination – including those founded on gender or religion – we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights. As the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom. We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to take part in the repression, and we express our grave concern in respect of the violent response of those in power. Finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition. Obviously, this report also outlines long-term strategic prospects. It touches on the potential of a partnership in many areas (geopolitics, energy, education and science and in the area of regional integration). From a geopolitical point of view, Iran clearly represents a genuine threat. Between Iran and Israel, the Gulf States would inevitably be the collateral victims of a conflict. These countries expect a lot from us in trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The GCC countries, which make up a quarter of Arab League member states, play a very important role in the peace process. Let us remember that they are behind the Arab peace initiative. With regard to energy, the GCC is the European Union’s leading oil supplier, so the EU is highly dependent on these countries, but their oil reserves are dwindling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy. We can offer our experience in this area. On an educational and scientific level, these countries are making education one of their priorities. Because of the limited number of universities and lecturers, we are seeing units of prestigious American universities being set up. Unfortunately, the European Union, although committed, is very much lagging behind the United States. For example, only eight students from GCC countries came to Europe last year as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme. Finally, in the area of regional integration, the GCC is slow to make progress. Wiser for its experience, the European Union can offer its help, advice and know-how; finally, we call for the signing of a free trade agreement which has been in negotiation for over 20 years.

 I voted for this resolution, which is a step in the right direction as regards the reaction of the European Union to the revolution, which is degenerating into civil war, in Libya. Revolutions are a dream that becomes reality, but civil war is a nightmare. With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi’s troops and mercenaries, and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime, we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them. We have heard the appeal that the Interim Transitional National Council made on 5 March. It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime. With no direct military presence on Libyan soil, a no-fly zone should be considered. But the decision rests with the UN. However, this option could only be envisaged with the explicit consent of the Arab League. At a political and diplomatic level, we have to ensure that Colonel Gaddafi is isolated and help the Libyan people to finally regain their freedom. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The revolutions in the Arab world must not divert our attention from the Middle East peace process. On the contrary, they are an opportunity to be seized. Palestine is due to hold presidential and legislative elections before the summer, and the Palestinian Authority wants to establish legitimate institutions and manage its security. The ongoing construction of Israeli settlements is an injustice and a provocation to the Palestinians. Today, we have the opportunity, with this wind of freedom that is blowing over the whole of the Arab world, to relaunch the negotiations. The EU must take the initiative to relaunch them. Why not do so within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 With this vote, Parliament has reached another milestone on the road towards global financial regulation. We have sent a strong message in favour of the projects of the French Presidency of the G20. When the economy shows its first signs of recovery, we will have to work together to promote a well thought-out, balanced model of liberalism. The European left tried to take sole credit for the idea of taxing financial transactions. It was misguided, however. Europeans know when to be pragmatic. Today’s vote shows that this notion extends beyond all political differences. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which I believe is fair and balanced. The people of Egypt are seeing their legitimate expectations met. Mr Mubarak’s departure is an essential condition, but it is not enough to ensure that Egypt embarks on a path towards democracy and human rights. The transition is being overseen by the army, which has given itself six months to rise to this challenge. During the 18 days of demonstrations that led to this result, Egypt suffered financial losses, and they are becoming worse each day. The European Union must offer its support to Egypt so that the achievements of the revolution are not destroyed by a harsh economic and social crisis. So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results, and this has not done much for the EU’s image. However, our role remains crucial. We should not criticise ourselves unfairly. Revolutions are peculiar in that they always seem inevitable after the fact but impossible before it. However, self-criticism is justifiable, and we are on the right track, since the Council and the Commission have demonstrated their desire to radically rethink the European neighbourhood policy.

The sudden arrival of thousands of migrants on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is an exceptional event. However, this event brings us face to face with a problem which concerns all Europeans. Right now, it is important that European solidarity should function properly. I agree with you, Commissioner, in your appeal to the Member States to deliver urgent aid to Italy, both in terms of goods and in terms of finance. Very often, in these situations, the countries in which migrants arrive are not their final destinations. Reception centres are frequently outdated, and serious tensions sometimes arise in areas where migrants are received. We have already passed some significant milestones in the fight against illegal immigration and in regulating flows. However, in a Union where internal borders have practically disappeared, Europe must equip itself in the long term with the means to achieve its ambitions. It must create a genuine immigration policy, open a constructive dialogue with countries of origin and strengthen the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) in its missions.

 This motion for a resolution reaffirms Europeans’ commitment to the root-and-branch reforms sought by the people of Tunisia. Europe has maintained a special relationship with the people of Tunisia for a long time. It was the only international organisation to introduce clauses relating to respect for human rights and democratic values into its relations with Tunisia. European economic assistance, provided within the context of the neighbourhood policy, has helped to improve the average standard of living, to create employment, to train young people and to provide access for women to positions of responsibility. Europe is today anxious to support the people of Tunisia in the democratic transition that is beginning. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the situation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion, which condemns the deadly attacks against Christians in the East. The attacks against Christians in recent months are a tragedy for the many victims, particularly in Baghdad and Alexandria, but also for their co-religionists. Christians have lived in the East for 2 000 years; they are inscribed in the history of their country. Today, however, they are fleeing the region en masse. Because of this forced exile, these countries are losing a substantial proportion of their human resources. The Near and Middle East regions have always been an area of diversity and cohabitation of religious minorities. The terrorists behind these attacks are trying to instigate a clash between East and West, pitting the Muslim world against the Christian world. All of this has been fiendishly planned. Christians in Iraq and Egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed. It is important that the Egyptian and Iraqi authorities find and harshly judge the authors of these massacres.

 For the next six months, you will hold the Presidency of the Council, and many challenges await you. You are making the exit from the crisis your top priority. I am convinced that under your Presidency, the institutions and the Member States will continue to work well together. It is our duty to ensure the long-term survival of the solidarity and stabilisation mechanisms, which have already shown their worth. In order to achieve our aims, we will also have to focus on reforming the international financial system. We, in Europe, have been the forerunners of the regulation and supervision of the financial markets. The French Presidency of the G20 is an opportunity that must be grasped. A united Europe should set an example to its foreign partners. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a key instrument in the Union’s foreign policy. Thanks to it, we maintain stable relationships with our closest neighbours. The Eastern Partnership, which is one of your priorities, should not be promoted at the expense of the Mediterranean Partnership. The Union for the Mediterranean is losing momentum and is equally deserving of our attention. Europe remains its firm supporter. What do you intend to do to revive it? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The citizens’ initiative is finally to see the light of day. This incredible democratic innovation will lay the foundations for a new European citizenship. It will become the instrument which enables the European public to give direct expression to their concerns on subjects which may be crucial to our common future. The scope for intervention is as important as the extended mandate of the Union. The European Parliament is encouraging rapid, effective implementation. This initiative was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and it still remained to the European institutions to come to an agreement on practical arrangements. The conditions for organising an initiative, which Parliament wanted to be flexible (a million people from at least a quarter of the Member States, which equates to seven countries today), will give citizens concerned all they need to request the Commission to propose a new legislative text. This will become a possibility next year. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The European Union must grant itself a budget equal to its ambitions. It must not let itself be carried along by the crisis but rise to the challenges it meets. With the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now plays on a level playing field with the Council and has made its mark as a proactive force. I voted for the 2011 budget as it is incumbent on us, as MEPs, to give Europe clear political direction. In 2011 Europe will keep its priorities on target. It will be able to revise upwards its financial needs in order to implement its new powers. Despite difficult economic circumstances, Parliament has managed to win a firm commitment from the Member States. On the proposal of Parliament, in 2011 the Commission will begin discussions on the different types of own resources, resources which Europe needs to guarantee its financial autonomy in the future. However, I am deeply concerned that Parliament has not found a consensus on the additional funding that the ‘Iter’ project will need from 2012. The experimental thermonuclear reactor, a flagship project of international research and European scientific dynamism, could have benefited from an unused and surplus portion of the 2011 budget.

 Looking carefully at the images available on the Internet, one can measure the level of violence used against the Moroccan law enforcement authorities. The scenes witnessed at both the Gdaim Izyk camp and on the road to Laâyoune are evidence of the deadly acts of violence against the Moroccan security services. Not even the emergency vehicles were spared. The reality is very far removed from what the propaganda would have us believe. Our Parliament therefore needs to show restraint and use discretion rather than unduly laying the blame on the Moroccan authorities and holding them fully responsible for this situation.

The financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules. Having stated in September that it was determined to supervise the markets, the European Parliament has today, 11 November, sent another powerful message to the rest of the world. From now on, alternative investment funds (hedge funds) entering Europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by Europe. What is more, they will have to be declared to the authorities and managed within the European Union. The non-regulation of these resources caused many bankruptcies, stock exchange crashes and social crises. France is about to take over the G20 Presidency for a year. Its main priority will be to reform the international financial system. With this vote, Europe is blazing a trail. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The financial, economic and social crisis has now been raging for two years. It has resulted in an unemployment rate of more than 10% in the EU and in the risk of a new recession. This is a crisis that we are unable to bring under control. The next G20 summit will take place on 11 and 12 November in Seoul, under the Presidency of France. Establishing the G20 was the brainchild of President Sarkozy, who believes that nowadays, the global economy is no longer regulated by the 8, but by all the major developing countries, too. This framework allows for the development of an ambition grounded in a long-term vision. This crisis demands that we have genuine economic governance, rules restricting social dumping in developing countries, financial regulation, and a reform of the international monetary system. To achieve this, Europe must know how to speak with one strong and determined voice. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 By voting today, Thursday, 7 October 2010 on a resolution, the European Parliament is demanding that the Commission give thought to significantly improving cohesion policy instruments. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion is no longer just economic and social; it is also territorial. Regional policy is one of the spearheads of European integration. It is the second heading in the Union’s budget, after the common agricultural policy. Europe needs to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of its regions. The development of cross-border transport links is one of the major challenges of this policy. One of the priorities in this area is the route across the Pyrenees between France and Spain, which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West. At the moment, the road and rail links do not meet expectations. Some regions, although linked from a socio-economic point of view, do not today enjoy adequate means of communication. The various projects that the Commission is due to carry forward in this geographical area will be carried out in the medium and long terms. They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013. Dominique Baudis  (PPE
),

Cross-border cooperation is essential for our neighbouring countries. How is it possible to have a prosperous and sustainable economy if the borders are closed? It provides better border security and intelligent management of migratory flows. However, some of our neighbouring regions, such as the Maghreb, do not know how to work together. In the majority of cases where cross-border cooperation among our neighbours is at a standstill there is an unfinished conflict with a long history behind it. It is obviously crucial that we give our neighbours the resources to cooperate. However, in order for the budgets allocated to be really useful, we need the European Union, in other words, you, Mr Füle, and especially Baroness Ashton, to be present on the political stage. It needs to be in a position to have an influence, be heard and be respected. Otherwise the Union for the Mediterranean is doomed to failure. In addition, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument creates a multitude of documents and suffers as a result of its complexity or even opacity. Parliament has almost no right to see the strategy documents and national indicative programmes. We must be consulted more often and be better informed, and the procedure must be simplified.

With the new competences that it has acquired since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union needs to rely on strong diplomacy. The European External Action Service (EEAS) represents considerable progress in this respect. I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on the EEAS because, in order to succeed in her mission, the High Representative urgently needs to acquire a competent diplomatic arm. My decision is based on the conclusions of the Madrid Conference of 21 June, where an institutional balance was found. The European interest of the initial draft has been retained. The Commission, the Council and Parliament will now be able to work together to establish an effective and operational European diplomatic service. I am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the EEAS will respect this balance. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you will now hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union for six months. Numerous challenges await you, including the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), one of the major advances in the Treaty of Lisbon. The agreement reached between the various institutions envisages that the Service will be created by January 2011, even though it took more than seven months to negotiate its organisational structure. The actual and effective creation of the EEAS is now a matter of urgency, because the Treaty of Lisbon’s credibility is at stake, together with Europe’s image within the international community. Your experience of negotiating and reaching compromises will help in the actual implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. We wish you every success. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, this attack on civilian ships by Israeli commandos clearly demands an impartial and credible inquiry. However, what confidence can we have in a commission that would be the judge in its own case? This attack took place in international waters; it therefore concerns the international community and it affects Europe in particular, as Europe has a Mediterranean coastline. Europe should make itself heard more and should become more closely involved in the search for a political solution based on two states with each having Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is making significant financial efforts to help develop the Palestinian Territories, but, unfortunately, it is too absent from the political process which should lead to the creation of this Palestinian state. The financial and budgetary goodwill that we are showing is not enough. We must also express political will and give ourselves the means to make ourselves heard. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, in the follow-up to the Barcelona process, the Union for the Mediterranean is an opportunity to develop our relations with the countries to the east and south of the Mediterranean basin. As the excellent report by Vincent Peillon emphasises, we cannot neglect either the potential of this region or the risks which it brings with it. Let us at least have the presence of mind to recognise that, since the bombing of Gaza and with the continuing colonisation of Palestinian territories, the Union for the Mediterranean has been painted into a corner. The political aspect is blocked. We are not even sure if the planned summit in Barcelona in June will actually take place. I would not be surprised if we were to learn in the coming days or hours that it has been postponed indefinitely. However, we should not give up; the European Union should assume greater responsibility in the search for a political solution. We cannot allow the United States to monopolise political crisis management in this region, our region, and confine ourselves to its development. Our security and growth depend on the development and stability of the Mediterranean, which is why the Union for the Mediterranean is still the best instrument at our disposal. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid any caricatures – we have heard one or two this morning – I would like to mention some objective facts regarding Tunisia, a partner country of the European Union. The social situation has evolved very favourably, with a spectacular increase in the average per capita income, and now the vast majority of Tunisians meet the criteria defining membership of the middle class. More than 90% of Tunisians enjoy welfare cover, and more than a quarter of Tunisia’s budget is devoted to education, with the result that the country is one of the very first to have achieved the Millennium Development Goals in the area of primary education. Finally, as Mr Michel highlighted a little while ago, women’s rights are both recognised and guaranteed. At university level, female students outnumber male students, and 40% of teachers are women. A quarter of politicians, local officials and journalists are women. Many countries would be envious of these statistics. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, the acts of fanatic criminals, who have killed some Christians in Egypt, cannot be ascribed to an entire population and its government. It would be unfair to hold Egypt and the Egyptians responsible for this appalling massacre, for which the perpetrators will be brought to justice. We must not confuse the acts of one criminal with the policy of an entire country! Let us not tar fanatics and an entire population with the same brush. Finally, by seeking to intervene between the Coptic Christians and their fellow Muslim citizens, we are adding fuel to the fire of the extremists, who want to portray Eastern Christians as agents of the West.

Many challenges await you in the field of foreign policy, especially as regards the southern shore of the Mediterranean. What do you intend to do to relaunch the Union for the Mediterranean, the headquarters of which are located in Barcelona? The Secretary General of the Union for the Mediterranean has recently been appointed. How do you envisage your collaboration with the Union for the Mediterranean’s first ever Secretary General?

During the last Foreign Affairs Council, the Council of the European Union made it known that it wanted a Palestinian state to be created in the near future, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is thus outlining the conditions of a viable solution to the Middle East conflict that is acceptable to both parties. The solution proposed by the Council is fair. Israel and Palestine can use it as a basis on which to exchange land for peace. The European Union has a major role to play. It can support inter-Palestinian reconciliation, without which there will be no Palestinian interlocutor in the negotiations with Israel. It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 Mr President, the SESAR programme, which aims to modernise air traffic management in Europe, is a major project. How is the Commission going to prepare for the forthcoming SESAR deployment phase and, in particular, for the financing of this programme, which is essential both for the environment and for our scientific and technical standing? Will the Commission follow the recommendations of the 2007 report, according to which a highly qualified individual should ensure political monitoring of this programme? Indeed, a number of obstacles will have to be overcome – of a legal, psychological and technical nature – to unite national airspaces and to succeed in getting controllers from the various countries to work together. If Europe is not able to create a single airspace, how will it be able to build a strong political union? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Following the negotiations at the European Council of 29 and 30 October and the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court of 3 November, the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, has signed the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty will now be able to enter into force, providing the institutions with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and with a stable President of the Council for two and a half years. The structure of the new Commission, like the choice of figures who will occupy the posts of President of the Council and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, are crucial. The choice of President of the Council is crucial since it is he or she who will embody Europe for two and a half years. Moreover, at a time of globalisation and of power struggles between continents, the choice of High Representative for Foreign Affairs is of undeniable strategic importance. On 19 November, an extraordinary European Council will meet to negotiate the nominations. We are at a turning point in European history. The choices that you make, Heads of State or Government, will determine the Europe that you want in the future. Therefore, be ambitious, because Europe must be dynamic, proactive, effective and political if we want it to continue to progress. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job-creating growth. That was the agenda of the G20 in Pittsburgh. On the other hand – and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference – it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption. In other words, we must restart the machine and ensure that that machine pollutes less. Moreover, these two issues cannot be resolved one after the other; they are both urgent. Relaunching economic activity is urgent, and limiting the consequences of economic activity is urgent. At the G20 yesterday, and at the climate-change conference tomorrow, the European Union must tread a narrow path between two equally formidable threats. The European institutions must be established as quickly as possible under the Treaty of Lisbon adopted by the 27 countries of the Union. By ‘playing for time’ to delay this moment, the Czech President, Mr Klaus, has a big responsibility towards the 500 million citizens of the Union. Jean-Marie Cavada,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this somewhat late hour the students are, I trust, sleeping, and it will not be long before their teachers are doing the same. We, however, are still up. Drawing as it does on the Commission’s last report on the European Schools’ system, our report aims to improve the European Schools concept, which must be adapted to the new economic requirements and the changes in society. This concept must remain a model of inspiration for national school systems, promoting European citizenship and encouraging increased mobility, as well as the learning of the languages of the Member States, the languages of the countries of Europe. These are the main points of this report: first, it contains a set of policy priorities to improve this educational model in Europe, in particular by establishing an appropriate legal basis for it, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The current legal status has reached its limits and requires a radical change to allow the Union to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the work of the Member States, without, of course, superseding their competence, and to adopt legally binding acts to that end pursuant to Articles 2 and 6 of the TFEU. I believe that Article 165 of the Treaty could be a perfectly appropriate legal basis. The European Schools must set an educational example by basing themselves on the dissemination of European culture, values, integration and languages. It is, therefore, essential for the Member States to cooperate when developing their national syllabuses, drawing on the simple example, which has worked wonderfully well up to now, of the teaching approach used by the European Schools. The opening of Type II and Type III Schools must be wholeheartedly encouraged. It is in this spirit that the report insists that holders of the European baccalaureate should be able, once and for all, to apply to any university in the EU, with the same rights as nationals of the country in question who hold equivalent qualifications, as it is essential that the baccalaureate is automatically recognised in all of the Union’s Member States. In this difficult period, I wished to stress the absolute need to rationalise the Schools’ management costs, without calling into question the fundamental principles on which the concept rests, especially mother-tongue teaching by native speakers, in order to maintain the quality of this teaching. Similarly, I believe it is essential to maintain equal and equivalent teaching conditions for the children of all language communities in the European Schools. It is, therefore, with a concern for fairness that the report highlights, in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, the plan to see general use of the working languages for teaching all non-fundamental subjects, without, of course, this being detrimental to those whose mother tongue is not one of the working languages. To ensure good governance of the European Schools, very serious attention must be paid to the lack of seconded staff. This must be compensated for by local recruitment of teachers, whose salaries should be paid by the Schools. The Board of Governors must, therefore, ensure that Member States that do not contribute financially by seconding teachers pay an equivalent financial contribution to the Schools’ budget. I wished to reaffirm moreover that, in these difficult times in particular, provision for students with special educational needs remains a priority, and I have asked the Board of Governors, in this regard, to ensure that coefficients are applied to this category of student when calculating class sizes in order to ensure their full integration. Finally, Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to repeat my call to the Board of Governors to work on providing alternatives that allow students who are unable to complete the course to find vocational courses. I would not wish to finish this presentation without thanking the Commission, my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs, and especially the parents’ associations, who have enabled us to reach a consensus on which to progress this issue. Forgive me for having stolen 45 seconds from you. Jean Marie Cavada  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this is such a serious matter that one must rise above the dreadful arguments that I have just heard in this House, because when we talk about the media we are talking about the health of a democracy. President-in-Office of the Council, I am one of those people who admire and feel affection for your country and for the Hungarian people. I fully understand that your government and some members of the public wanted information to be handled in a more balance way, and, objectively speaking, they were right. However, replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right. Consequently I am pleased this evening, but I am vigilant. I am pleased to see that your government has decided to return to several fundamental points and to change the December 2001 law on the media. This needed to be done and you did well to address this matter. I am also pleased that you are once more showing greater respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights which your people have always craved in the course of recent history. I would like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Kroes, and I support the composition of her group of monitoring experts. However, we will be vigilant, because we also feel that a number of points have not been dealt with, and we shall also pay attention to the details of the legislative amendments. In conclusion, I should like to tell you, President-in-Office of the Council, that you are the heirs to the fatherland of Liszt, of Kossuth, of the 1940 hero, Joël Brand, of Sándor Kopácsi and Colonel Maléter of 1956. You are the heirs of Sándor Márai. You are the heirs of Imre Kertész. So do not let us down! It was a Hungarian who invented the magical game that is Rubik’s cube. Do not teach us, in Europe, to play with the media in the style of a ‘Jobbik’s Cube’ because that is a dreadful game. Jean-Marie Cavada  (PPE

Presidents, we are very fearful of the future of banking. The economy has transferred its toxic debts to finance; finance has passed the buck to the Member States, and the Member States are now turning to the citizens, who will have to pay, if they are able to. Now, Mr Leterme, you know far better than I that Europe must now perform its historic duty; in other words, it must impose a Community approach on Europe’s national leaders in terms of common discipline, certainly, but also in terms of recovery and innovation. In this drama which is being played out before us, there is no longer any national way out of the global crisis. Many European leaders – your colleagues – are watching the popularity ratings. At the moment, Europe’s leaders must look at history before history itself submerges us in the chaos of populism. Belgium is a country that was always strong on European patriotism; whether it is in a good or a bad state is immaterial. It is the will, discipline and objectivity of its leaders that will save us.

 I voted for this resolution, since it strikes a good balance in condemning the serious acts of violence between Israel and Hamas. The cessation of rocket attacks is imperative and cannot be up for negotiation. Terror is not a policy and Hamas must understand that. Equally, however, while there can be no question that Israel is entitled to protect itself, Tzahal should be more measured in its retaliation. The blockade on the Gaza Strip has been going on for too long now. Tel-Aviv must loosen its grip on this narrow strip of land. Its actions are counter-productive from a security viewpoint and create an intolerable humanitarian situation for the Palestinians. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted in favour of this report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, as it makes a pertinent assessment of the Union’s record on the matter and of the challenges that we must prepare to tackle together. It is important not to allow Europe to enter a strategic decline. The European Union has the tools to pursue a truly ambitious policy in security and defence. As the report indicates, the European Union must preserve its military intervention capability, but also its capacity to intervene by civilian, economic, humanitarian and commercial means to deal with the new situations that are arising in the world, sometimes at the fringes of Europe. I believe that Parliament is making a clear appeal for Member States to make a stronger commitment to the Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the only way of maintaining the strategic weight of a Europe that has fallen prey to budgetary difficulties in a multipolar world.

 I voted in favour of these two texts on migration from the Schengen Information System (1+) to SIS II. Our first message is clear: this migration was decided on several years ago, it is very delayed and it is now time to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently in the all of the Member States. We therefore urge the Council to get this system up and running without any further delay. Moreover, the SIS is a vital component of the Schengen system and Europe’s internal structure for the fight against organised crime and for internal security. This second version will modernise this database and, above all, provide a central structure under the Community system. The migration and, more generally, the database are subject to one absolutely fundamental principle (which is reiterated in both texts): stringent rules on the protection of personal data.

 In the lively debate on shale gas in the European Union and its Member States, there is no absolute truth. There is clearly a halfway point between those who are pro shale gas and those who are anti it, and it is essential to take the heat out of the debate. It would be a major strategic error to renounce this energy source now without even continuing the research. Equally, however, allowing unbridled exploration when the technique is not yet fully developed would be environmental madness. Shale gas has undeniable potential and we need to look at it seriously. As things stand, however, shale gas exploration puts the environment at risk and it would be irresponsible to go down that path. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The International Convention on the Rights of the Child, the anniversary of which was the actual day of this vote, states that a child is not simply a fragile being in need of protection but a person with the right to be educated, cared for and protected regardless of the part of the world where he or she is born. On this International Children’s Rights Day, the European Parliament passed by a large majority a resolution on the protection of children in the digital world against the risks of violence, fraud, child pornography and sexual harassment which children may encounter on the internet. Our resolution strongly asks States to make additional efforts to combat illegal and harmful content on the internet, to minimise the risks of internet use for children, while insisting on the importance of educating children in the new digital media. At a time when internet surfing is becoming a habit for our children, we need to provide enhanced protection for them. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The crisis we have experienced since 2008 has shown up the cracks in the current architecture for economic and monetary union. Today we need to learn from the crisis and give the EU the frameworks it needs to ensure it remains economically and financially stable as well as prosperous. That is the very meaning of this report. By voting in favour I also wanted to support two demands relating to democracy and social issues, which I believe are essential to this next wave of integration. Firstly, I believe strengthening economic and monetary union can only happen alongside a guarantee of greater democracy, which requires the involvement of and supervision by the European Parliament and national parliaments. Secondly, in view of the serious social crisis facing several Member States, I particularly support the recommendation to introduce social and employment benchmarks alongside current fiscal and macroeconomic benchmarks.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 is to be the European Year of Citizens, the year of European citizenship, 20 years after the creation of European citizenship and, as has been said several times this evening, one year before the renewal of the European Parliament. It is therefore a very symbolic year, even a very serious year, particularly in the present context. In fact, the latest surveys show that, since autumn 2009, there has been a very worrying and very noticeable trend towards a serious and very substantial loss of confidence in Community actions and the Community acquis
, even, when it comes to rights and freedoms, within the European Union itself. Faced with this situation, the essential question has always been, and still is, the need to consolidate a European identity, to succeed in creating a common feeling of belonging, to make a real success of defining the shape of this European citizenship, a shape which will be applicable to all Europeans. There is no doubt that this objective which has been announced can be achieved in 2013, but only by means of more information, more dialogue, more meetings, more exchanges and more sharing. Although I am delighted with the excellent quality of the text, I wish that our institutions, when making their choices and decisions, would show enough determination to give themselves the means of achieving their objectives, and would thereby demonstrate a strong political willingness to practice what they preach. Moreover, though of course I am happy about the results obtained in the negotiations, in particular by Ms Papadopoulou, who showed great determination, especially regarding the broadening of the scope of this European Year of Citizens in the decision-making process, the European civil dialogue, etc., I have strong reservations about the ridiculous budget allocated to this European Year, the smallest ever given to a European Year. Since the task is so enormous, I am sorry that the Council and certain members of the Committee on Budgets have refused to grant resources for this Year, which is, without doubt, one of the most important and one which, in my opinion, should be regarded as the Union’s first priority, because without European citizens we have no Europe and we cannot integrate Europe.

 I voted firmly in favour of this report, which, once again, strongly condemns the inadmissible practices of ‘extraordinary rendition’, secret prisons and torture, and, above all, EU Member States’ complicity in these CIA ‘programmes’. We have been demanding, for years now, that Member States involved in such activities conduct thorough, impartial and independent inquiries into the failings and abuses which occurred, and demanding that the European Union bring its action in line with its values. In this new report, we restate these demands. More detailed enquiries must be carried out and responsibility must be determined. The adoption of this report is a new step towards remedying these inadmissible practices. However, much work still remains to be done in order to establish the truth and acknowledge all of the violations which were committed. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

By adopting this own-initiative report, we wanted to send a clear message – separately from the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the asylum package – that the Dublin II system, whose faults and limitations have become clear, needs to be reformed. Our message is twofold: it emphasises both responsibility and solidarity. This is because it is fundamentally necessary to increase solidarity among European states in the area of asylum, as has become clear following the recent migratory flows following the events in Tunisia, then in Libya and now in Syria. More than ever, Europe needs a genuine common European asylum system, and there is an urgent need to implement European directives on asylum in order to make our European asylum system credible and efficient.

 The European Union had to react to the Mediator scandal, which claimed hundreds of victims, due to a lack of effective alert and response mechanisms in the face of a harmful drug. I voted for this amendment to the European legislation on pharmacovigilance because I think it is moving in the right direction: that of transparency and control. I think that the three main measures it introduces are very important: the real reasons behind a company’s decision to withdraw a medicine in a country will be known, these medicines will be systematically subjected to an urgent assessment, which will reveal the levels of hazard, and finally, a symbol on the medicine’s packaging will inform patients and practitioners if the medicine has been subject to an additional safety study. Within the framework of the organisation of the market for medicine, in which the EU has some powers, these measures will help to ensure, at EU level, that a health crisis such as the one we saw with Mediator will never happen again.

 I felt it was important to vote in favour of this resolution, which reaffirms certain principles regarding the donation of tissues and cells. It is an ethical requirement. However, several Member States do not take it into consideration: donations of tissue and cells should be voluntary, unpaid and, without any exception, anonymous. These ethical failures in certain Member States are set in an environment of regular revelations of cases of trafficking in human products. The main reason for my vote is to send a message to the Member States that they must put a stop to this trafficking. The scope of this resolution goes beyond ethical questions and addresses the issues of public health and the fight against criminal activities. Moreover, this resolution encourages the creation of systems allowing for greater European and international cooperation, aimed at improving the management of the growing need for human tissues and cells for innovative treatments, a need that, in itself, constitutes a major challenge for public health.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate our two co-rapporteurs on their work. After intense negotiations, which were difficult but exceedingly well organised, they managed to come to an agreement with the EU Council that will allow minimum standards on the protection of victims to be introduced throughout the European Union, marking another stage in the creation of the area of freedom and justice at Community level. Given the current situation, it is rare in the Union to find so many reasons to be satisfied. This evening, we can all welcome the mechanism outlined in this text to protect victims, who form a legal category that, as you said, Commissioner, is often forgotten in our national legal systems. Justice for victims means protecting them, facilitating their access to justice, supporting them and giving them the right to legitimate compensation. It was therefore essential to have this coordinated, integrated approach that benefits victims. I welcome three points in particular. The first is the fact that the Council largely agreed to better protection for children. This text pays particular attention to children and their needs, and to their vulnerability as far as protection is concerned. That is covered by this text, and Article 22 in particular, which enshrines in full the principles and standards advocated by the Council of Europe, and the rights specific to children and their protection. Secondly, as you pointed out, Commissioner, we need to train practitioners and all those likely to come into contact with victims, including civil servants, lawyers, and those responsible for victim support: Article 24 emphasises the need for general and specialist training, which is a good concrete, realistic step forward at Community level. Finally, it is essential to develop the network of host structures to ensure that all victims can find someone nearby who will listen to and support them. This personalised aid is fundamental in the European Union because these victims are often alone and distraught because of these traumatic situations. Now, Commissioner, all that remains is to take the necessary measures to inform the public and raise awareness of this new mechanism. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted resolutely against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) because the Agreement contained too many uncertainties and posed too many serious risks to the fundamental rights of Europeans. The benefit of ACTA, however, was that it tackled some real challenges: protecting intellectual property rights against counterfeiting and piracy, and setting out some real issues for enterprises, creation and intellectual property rights in Europe and in the world, which are essential. However, the negotiations on the agreement did not reconcile these requirements with the protection of citizens’ individual freedoms and fundamental rights. The outcome of the vote could not have been any different. It is an historic vote because it is the first time that the European Parliament has rejected an international trade agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 After many months of negotiations, we have at last adopted the recast of the European railway legislation. Although it does not regulate everything, it nevertheless allows rail transport to be strengthened in the EU, particularly by clarifying the roles of the various actors in the rail transport sector. The flagship measures include strengthening the independence of the national regulators and establishing a European network of regulators in order for there to be a uniform interpretation and application of the legislation. Another vital aspect of this recast is the clarification of financial flows between the infrastructure manager and railway undertaking. This vote does not signal the end of the reform of the European railway market. Indeed, next year, the Commission should present new legislative proposals, particularly on the thorny issue of the liberalisation of national passenger transport and on the separation between the infrastructure management and transport operations.

 Better working conditions and greater compliance with legislation on driving and rest times for drivers in Europe: these are the reasons why I have decided to vote in favour of this text. It is also about creating greater transparency in an industry that is still very opaque. It is too easy to manipulate the tachographs currently in use and they do not provide the necessary guarantees to ensure that drivers’ driving and rest times are recorded efficiently in Europe. That is why it was crucial to adopt a text which lays the foundations for the use of new digital tachographs that will enable more effective checks which are also less restrictive for drivers.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution, which calls for the eCall system to be installed in all new cars by 2015. This is an important step forward for road safety as, were this technology to be introduced, it could enable a great number of lives to be saved on European roads. It is now up to the European Commission to come back to us with a legislative proposal. We in the European Parliament have expressed our view in the clearest possible manner.

 In accordance with European legislation, the Commission has a duty to translate European law and the related documents into all EU official languages to allow citizens, economic operators, NGOs and other interested parties to exercise their rights. However, in reality, many documents are only available in English. These include public consultations, even though they address citizens directly and are a fundamental component of drawing up transparent EU policies. Our resolution therefore urges the Commission to ensure that every EU citizen’s right to address the EU institutions in any of the EU official languages is fully respected and implemented. Respect for multilingualism is a principle, a right which is very important to me and we must defend it. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As Vice-Chair of the Tibet Intergroup, it is with much conviction that I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet. Our Parliament works tirelessly to protect the Tibetan people from the attacks and violence that they have been suffering for many years. In this sitting, we have adopted a new text which calls for the appointment of a special coordinator for respect for human rights in Tibet, which calls for constructive dialogue between China and the Central Tibetan Administration and which also calls on China to grant Tibetans their autonomy and to respect the fundamental rights (freedom of expression, freedom of belief, freedom of association, and so on) of the Tibetan people. Finally, the resolution strongly condemns the Chinese attitude towards Tibetans: the repression, prison sentences, and so on. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The PIP breast implants scandal has brought to light all of the shortcomings in the legislation on breast implants. For years, companies have been able to sell implants with defective gel to thousands of women worldwide without concern. In terms of public health, there should be no half measures. That is the message that I wanted to send by voting for this resolution, which proposes a strict framework so that such mistakes are not made again. We are clearly asking for more safety controls, but also, and above all, for greater traceability and a more restrictive marketing authorisation system. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I am pleased that the issue of the negotiations on the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) has finally been put on the work agenda of our European Parliament, particularly thanks to pressure from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to which I belong. By this, we hope that our Parliament is able to voice its opinion on this matter and that the European institutions adopt a strong common position to find a solution to the problems of arms transfers. Indeed, for the international community to sign a treaty of this nature sends a strong signal, insofar as it will establish common binding standards for the import, export and transfer of arms. This trade must urgently be regulated in view of the arms transfers that fuel conflicts, poverty and violations of the rights of individuals. We are calling for clear, binding provisions, which meet the highest international standards in accordance with international humanitarian law. This problem must urgently be tackled head on if we are to ensure lasting security and stability in the world. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Europe and its institutions are often depicted as being far removed from the citizens and their concerns and needs. Nonetheless, the European Union regularly steps in to assist ‘distressed areas’ or areas ‘experiencing difficulties’, especially through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This week, for example, Parliament has approved support amounting to EUR 1.6 million from the EGF for footwear workers in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain. The industry is currently being hit by highly aggressive competition from Asian countries and is faced with making numerous redundancies. I voted firmly in favour of adopting this report. Such assistance is both natural and essential: Europe is based on solidarity, so when one of its Member States is in difficulty, it is perfectly normal to come to its aid. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted for this report, which aims to strengthen and facilitate cross-border volunteering and to reduce the administrative, legal and linguistic barriers to volunteering. In this report, we call on Member States to set national targets for volunteering and to recognise the rights of volunteers, in particular, by establishing a European statute for volunteering. Our report also suggests introducing an online information portal on issues related to volunteering. 100 million European citizens are currently working in voluntary activities. Volunteering offers an incredible opportunity for exchange and learning, and cross-border volunteering offers great potential for education, employment and citizenship, to improve mutual understanding and help develop a stronger European identity. Volunteering is one way of living as an active European citizen and, being from the only French region that borders three other Member States, that is something close to my heart.

 The issue of equal pay for men and women has been on the political agenda for very many years now, but progress has been extremely slow. That is why I voted in favour of this text, which recommends, amongst other things, laying down stricter penalties for employers who practise pay discrimination of this nature. While I am not in favour of imposing penalties right, left and centre, it is true to say that certain employers today do not comply with rules which were laid down in the past. In 2012, it is no longer acceptable for women to earn around 17% less than men. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Once again, the European Parliament has voted in favour of this financial transaction tax with a large majority. I welcome this vote, which sends a strong signal to the markets and to those Member States still reluctant to impose such a tax. The high-risk behaviour of the financial markets contributed extensively to the crisis we are going through. It is absolutely crucial that they participate in the collective effort being made to get Europe out of this crisis and back on the road to growth. The European Parliament has expressed its view to that effect. It is now up to the Member States to do the same. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As the EU pursues its goal to build a European area of freedom, security and justice, it needs a strong internal security strategy. The own-initiative report that we have adopted by a very wide majority therefore stipulates, first and foremost, that this strategy and all measures that are taken must thoroughly satisfy the obligations placed on them in terms of fundamental rights and upholding the rule of law. Our report then goes on to stress that the strategy must be backed by sufficient financial resources in the next budget period, to allow the European Union to actually address these challenges, and to do so in a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent way. Lastly, our strategy sets out five key areas for action in which the EU provides added value, and for which we need greater European cooperation. I am delighted that this report has been adopted.

 I voted in favour of this report, which sets out a framework for the future development of an EU criminal policy. In the building of a European area of liberties and justice, the criminal sphere has always been treated somewhat separately since it is a rather sensitive area directly affecting regulatory powers. Yet, at the current time, it is difficult to imagine that criminal law should fall outside the scope of constructing a Europe based on laws. The communitisation of criminal law is a considerable challenge, but also a necessity in terms of large-scale crime and cross-border crime, and this is the issue addressed by this report. Moreover, I welcome the perspectives provided by such communitisation in Europe: firstly, ‘eurocrimes’, as well as the creation of a genuine European Public Prosecutor’s Office, whose remit must go well beyond the mere protection of the financial interests of the European Union.

 At a time when the crisis and the disparities between regions are being accentuated within the European Union, territorial cohesion must be at the heart of EU policies now more than ever. It is this basic principle that I wanted to reaffirm by voting for this report. Indeed, regional airports have a key role to play in the economic development of the most remote regions by attracting companies, in particular, and also by enabling the development of tourism. Furthermore, as we are currently discussing the review of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), it would be appropriate, in this debate, to grant regional airports an important place alongside other major European transport nodes. In my view, this seems essential in order to achieve an optimal network across the EU. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution accompanying discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament’s 2010 budget. While I support the general guidelines contained in this resolution, I strongly oppose two clearly anti-Strasbourg amendments (Amendments 6 and 15), which were tabled and incorporated into this resolution. The debate and the attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament resurface with increasing regularity, and I am very mindful of this. Although it was long a symbolic issue, today it has become a predominantly legal and political one. I remain firmly committed to this permanent fight to keep the seat of the European Parliament within our beautiful European capital. Moreover, I voted against Amendment 4, which wanted to abolish the LUX Prize. Awarded each year by the European Parliament, the LUX Prize rewards films that go to the heart of European public debate and illustrate the universality of European values, cultural diversity and the process of European integration.

 While three out of four Europeans use their mobile phone while travelling, many find horrendously high bills waiting for them when they get home. Competition in the mobile roaming sector within the EU is still weak, leading to very high prices for consumers. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached at first reading on a text which I am sure provides effective solutions for improving the situation in the mobile roaming market for European consumers. Firstly, separating the provision of mobile phone services on national territory from roaming services will improve competition, as consumers will be able to choose whether they wish to keep the same communications provider while travelling and benefit from more attractive pricing. Secondly, gradually capping the maximum allowed charges made when billing for voice, SMS and data services between now and 2014 will be hugely beneficial to consumers. Furthermore, consumers will benefit from numerous measures improving transparency, such as the provision of information on roaming tariffs outside the EU, information on accumulated consumption expressed in the unit or currency of billing, and the introduction of safeguard caps (EUR 50 by default).

Once again, pirates from the Horn of Africa are attacking cargo boats off their coasts. Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is not, therefore, in decline. There are increasing numbers of incidents and they are becoming more violent. At the same time, more than 190 sailors are still held hostage and poverty remains ever present in this region of the world. I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, which calls for a strengthening of military resources, and also for solutions to be found to address the root causes of piracy. It is obviously essential to step up military presence, but that must be accompanied by an increase in humanitarian aid. Let us not forget that piracy and violence in the Horn of Africa are nourished, first and foremost, by the extreme poverty that prevails in the region. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Mr President, after being there in July 2011, I was, of course, deeply affected, as we all were, by the stories, the journeys, the courage, the path taken by these men, these women, these children who were suffering, arriving every day in Italy on the island of Lampedusa, before being crammed into detention centres in terrible conditions, sometimes defying all humanity, violating all human dignity, a long way from the much coveted European dream. There are both questions being asked and long-term political effects. Some such questions are: following our visits, we have all denounced the lack of information and today, one year later, we are still lacking information. How are the recent arrivals being managed? How many people have arrived? In what conditions are they living today? How many have been transferred to other centres or to the continent and where are the programmes on the island itself? We would like to know how the Italian authorities have used the more than EUR 232 million given to them to enable them to respond to this difficult situation. However, there are also long-term political effects. Apart from the fact that the paradise shores of the Italian island will forever remain extremely famous – the island of hopes and dreams for the arrival of these many Mediterranean boat people – I regret that this crisis in Lampedusa has brought us where we are today. This migratory crisis has been caused by poor management with regard to the arrival of these immigrants, which has furthermore led us to a famous France-Italy episode, to Italy granting temporary residence permits for migrants, then to the closure of borders by France and by Mr Sarkozy, culminating in a dramatic result for Europe and European integration, to a debate, which is today highly politicised, on the Schengen area, and to a situation where Europeans no longer like Europe because of Schengen and where this is being reflected in the elections. A real policy is therefore needed … (The President cut off the speaker) Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, SWIFT, ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) and PNR (Passenger Name Records) are acronyms that we often hear and which are a source of concern to Europeans who do not really know what lies behind them. What is the reality hidden behind these names? Excessively generalised surveillance of passengers, and an agreement which means that if I take an aeroplane, the United States will know about my dietary tastes, my behaviour at the airport, aspects of my health, and so on. Without going over all the arguments that have been advanced this morning in a long but fascinating debate, I would like to remind you that, since 2007, we have been calling for guarantees, such as red lines, which would have allowed us to obtain an agreement from Parliament. Yet we do not have this at the moment, either in terms of reciprocity or in terms of proportionality, as our admirable colleague, Mr Watson, reminded us in relation to the position taken by the United States, and I would question the proposals of Mrs Foster, which claim that passenger name records do not involve all that much. If they do not involve all that much, then let us call for reciprocity from the United States. In this Chamber, some people are saying that this is the best that we could achieve, that we will not get any more, that we must ask the judges. It is unacceptable to abdicate our responsibilities in this way. It is up to us to create the conditions of balance, of European democracy, between the security of combating terrorism and the preservation of liberties. That is why I will vote against this agreement. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Madam President, although slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, there are still many children, and some women and men, who fall victim to human trafficking in Europe every day. We are talking about domestic slaves, prostitutes, beggars and clandestine workers who live through a genuine ordeal of physical violence, humiliation and, at every stage of this hell, anger. Moreover, in nearly 40% of cases this phenomenon involves children. Totally powerless, these people are taken away, held against their will, beaten, subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, and deprived of their rights. The Union and its Member States have a historic responsibility, as you have reminded us, Commissioner, and we must act together to face up to this criminal activity which flouts the whole spectrum of human rights, particularly those of women. Above all, though, it is of course up to the Union to protect children, the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society. In relation to this cooperation, Commissioner, although the directive does of course represent an advance and a step forward, it is your task to exert strict supervision of the Member States’ responsibilities through specific and tangible measures, so that we can eliminate this veritable cancer which contravenes the foundations of our democratic societies and the values that have been cemented by European integration. What will you do in relation to the Member States’ obligation to transpose the directive? The second question is: what news is there of the information and awareness campaign? Finally, what about the collection of information relating to trafficking in human beings, and what actions could be taken precisely on the basis of this data collection? Nathalie Griesbeck,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have spoken about challenge. While it is true that Greece is facing an enormous challenge, we need, above all, to respond to a challenge facing the European Union: its image in the world, and how the citizens see it. One would have thought that the end of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin wall, would lead us to believe that we would never again see the construction of other walls anywhere in Europe. Yet this is not at all the case. There is an enormous project, devised by Greece, to try to resolve to its huge problems caused by the arrival – as our Greek colleague said – of more than 300 people a day at its borders through a transit country, Turkey, and these are citizens who do not come from Turkey but from many other countries around the world. One would have thought that such a thing would never be seen again. What is more, this phenomenon is accompanied by an utterly disgraceful humanitarian situation, which violates the human rights we are constantly developing, protecting, defending and safeguarding as the most precious gift that the European Union has given to its citizens. The solutions to the problems are, needless to say, difficult, and the messages are complex. Without getting into the technical side of things, it is of course quite clear that solidarity – as Cecilia Malmström has just explained, through the idea of shared responsibility, through technical mechanisms, the funding that must be used, the earmarking of EU funds – should make it possible to provide effective aid and to address the situation in which these people find themselves with dignity and in a manner that is consistent with human rights. The second message, which has often been heard in recent weeks in Europe, is to up the stakes in the construction of texts and a rule of law system conveying the solidarity of the Member States towards Greece, which is coming under pressure along its borders. To ‘up the stakes’ means to construct a veritable arsenal of texts applicable by all and not to miss the point either, like when in my country, France, we talk about re-erecting internal borders when what we should be doing is protecting external borders – in a spirit of humanism, it should be remembered. Finally, Madam President, the third reply, or the third message underlying our proposals, is to have the possibility and the political will to achieve a balance between the north and the south and to use development aid and partnerships with southern countries so that migrants have no desire to come to an El Dorado that does not exist.

Madam President, I of course fully appreciate that Greece cannot deal with the situation alone. That is what I was trying to explain. I had the opportunity to visit the island of Samos in Greece where I saw the very difficult situation at first hand, and I also visited the island of Lampedusa, where I saw just how complicated the problems were. It is by acting together in solidarity, supporting Greece, a Member of the European Union, as much as possible, that we will be able to respond. However, for these responses to be substantive, they must be taken into account across all EU policies. I of course recognise the difficulty facing Greece. It is as if I were Greek.

 I voted for this report, which makes two noteworthy improvements to the coordination of social security systems within the European Union. The first is the clarification concerning access to unemployment benefits, enabling self-employed frontier workers to receive unemployment benefits in the country in which they have been working if they are resident in another Member State where there is no unemployment benefit system. The second is the introduction of the ‘home base’ concept for aircrew members (pilots, air hostesses, etc.), which will put an end to the social dumping that low-cost airlines practise against their personnel and thus guarantee fair social security for all aircrew personnel. As a native of a very ‘cross-border’ region, I fully support any initiative that strengthens the mobility of European citizens within the European Union, so that they can travel, move and work throughout the EU without administrative barriers.

Given their situation, their characteristics, their geographical distance, the structural weaknesses of their economies and their dependence on the outside world, etc., the outermost regions (ORs) of the European Union should be granted special treatment under the European Union’s cohesion policy, so that their unique features are adequately considered and protected. At a time when we are negotiating the new EU budget programming with the EU institutions, our Parliament has strongly objected to the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for ORs by nearly half, pointing out that these regions should receive special treatment. In this resolution, which I supported, we also insist that the specific characteristics of the ORs are taken into account in all European Union policies: fisheries and maritime policy, transport, the environment, etc. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Cancelled flights, lost baggage, delays, overbooking, etc. are all dysfunctions that are currently poorly addressed by the regulations in force. What was needed, therefore, was a new framework and new instruments to guarantee air passengers’ rights in all circumstances. That has now been achieved through this resolution, which, above all, provides greater transparency both in the information given when flights are delayed or cancelled and also in the prices that airlines advertise. Together with this need for transparency, there was also a need to improve the assistance given to passengers. Accordingly, this resolution states that passengers in difficulty should be able to talk directly to contact personnel who can provide immediate solutions and answers. In addition, the report considers that, if luggage is delayed by more than six hours, compensation should be offered that is proportionate to passengers’ needs so that they have the items they need while waiting for their luggage to arrive. Lastly, the resolution stresses that persons with reduced mobility should be given easier access to aircraft. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

In the negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in securing a number of key points: the explicit reference to regional protection programmes, especially the visibility of North Africa, the addition of ‘survivors of violence and/or torture’ to the vulnerable persons category and a reference to refugees from Iraq. I therefore voted in favour of this agreement at second reading. In addition, the negotiations on this text, aimed at amending the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund in the light of the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme, have been going on for nearly two years. We cannot allow this situation to continue when there are thousands of refugees who could benefit from this programme. Indeed, resettlement is the only viable and safe solution as these people are often in an extremely vulnerable situation. The European Union must step up its resettlement efforts in order to protect refugees and maximise the impact of resettlement by focusing, where possible, on those most in need, in accordance with the common priorities established at EU level.

 I voted against the Vaughan report on the draft budget for the European Parliament for the financial year 2013. I do fully support the measures and guidelines contained in this report, such as freezing our Parliament’s budget in real terms, freezing Members’ allowances, the cuts made in the budget relating to travel, the various savings that have been made, etc. However, this report contains three provisions/paragraphs that are clearly anti-Strasbourg. That is why I voted against it. The debate and attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament are coming up more and more often and I am very aware of that. Of course, for a long time, it was a question of symbolism; but today, and above all, it is a legal and political matter. I remain firmly committed to this ongoing fight to keep the European Parliament’s seat in our beautiful European capital. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The report that we have adopted by a very large majority this week aims to list the obstacles to European citizenship that still exist and persist (with regard to free movement, recognition of qualifications and non-discrimination, for example) and to firmly ask Member States to remove these difficulties. Beyond that, citizenship should be the European Union’s number one priority as, without European citizens, there would be no Europe and we could not construct Europe, especially in the context of the economic crisis, the crisis of values that we are facing today. There is currently only a slight sense of European citizenship. Yet, this lack of ‘European sentiment’, this lack of involvement from citizens in the European Union and the EU’s lack of transparency for European citizens are Europe’s greatest flaws. What European citizens are missing is the feeling of belonging to a European community and this is vital for the European Union. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 This week, our Parliament approved the setting up of a special parliamentary committee on organised crime, corruption and money laundering and I welcome it. I am convinced that this committee will provide an effective tool in analysing and evaluating these complex transnational phenomena, in preventing them and, most particularly, in combating them. This committee will be able to establish contacts, make visits, hold hearings, act with civil society and grassroots actors who are fighting on a daily basis against these scourges and, consequently, will be able to recommend measures to enable the European Union to combat these threats. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Language difficulties, lack of understanding of neighbouring judicial systems, infrequent contacts and exchanges between institutions: these are all obstacles to the construction of a European judicial area. The challenges of judicial training at the level of the European Union are therefore considerable as there can be no construction of a European judicial area if we do not provide appropriate training for those who are the actors within it. Therefore, we must really take this issue in hand and make considerable efforts in relation to judicial training, not only of judges, but also of all other legal practitioners: lawyers, notaries, ombudsmen … in other words, all legal practitioners. There is a clear need today to build a European judicial culture and to do everything in our power to achieve this. We must promote contacts, exchanges and, in particular, I would like to point out the importance of setting up a genuine ‘Erasmus for judges’. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The European Union is the world’s principal consumer of chocolate, 70% of global cocoa production is cultivated in West Africa and approximately 18 million children throughout the world are estimated to work on cocoa plantations. The European Union cannot turn a blind eye to this utterly unacceptable situation which is dreadful in human terms. These children work in extremely dangerous conditions, they are frequently exposed to pesticides, and many are victims of human trafficking. I therefore strongly voted in favour of the annex to this resolution, which follows Parliament’s consent to the renewal of the International Cocoa Agreement in terms of production and commerce. This resolution is aimed at focusing on the issue of child labour in cocoa plantations and, in particular, it strongly condemns the use of child labour (and unacceptable types of work) in the growing and harvesting of cocoa beans.

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on addressing the European Union’s diabetes epidemic, which calls on the Commission to develop and implement a targeted European strategy on diabetes prevention, diagnosis, education and research, and calls on the Member States to implement national diabetes programmes, focusing on prevention. Diabetes affects almost 10% of Europe’s population and this figure is expected to increase by 16.6% by 2030. It is therefore necessary for the EU to adopt a European strategy to complement the national efforts in order to provide ongoing financial support for research and encourage early diagnosis of the disease.Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, José Manuel, I do not know if I should make a speech: I fully support yours! I do not need to repeat it but I will just echo a few comments that you made and look at them in more detail, although I feel that you covered everything. The only thing that has not been said is that with EUR 1.1 billion or EUR 1.13 billion, the budget that we have today, we can continue our policies; but below EUR 1 billion, we cannot do anything. I think that the Commission and Parliament have to stand firm in relation to what is happening now in the Council. As you said, on the one hand, there are those who want a long-term budget that can meet the challenges ahead: because the European budget is an investment budget and not a budget of expenditure; because we need it to relaunch growth and job creation and, in my opinion, no Head of State or Government is opposed to that. Then there are those who want a reduced budget to make short-term savings. In these conditions, do we really need a summit this afternoon? We need to meet to discuss, but not to reduce, the budget. The European Parliament’s position is clear, however; this position is now that of the majority in Europe and 517 Members of this Parliament voted for a multiannual financial framework (MFF) that is realistic and meets our ambitions. Sixteen Heads of Government are following this line and they met last week, as you said. If I were to give them one piece of advice, I would say: ‘be united at the Council and stand firm when it comes to defending our common budget’. At the risk of repeating myself, those who see only a free trade area and a single market in Europe are lying to themselves and they are lying to their citizens. The European Union is, above all, a Community of values, including that of solidarity. Did you know that, through the European Stability Mechanism, the Estonians and the Slovakians are helping to fund pensions in Greece, which are even higher than their own? I wanted to highlight this – and it is not said often enough – because these countries believe in the added value of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, my group is convinced that the European Union needs a sound, solid, responsible budget because, with the crisis, it is the only way for certain Member States to make investments. In the Baltic countries, for example, a Prime Minister told me last week that without funding from Europe, railway lines will continue to be connected to Moscow, and not to Europe. That is not what European integration means. However, like us, the Baltic countries need these connections to Europe. To achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we will need more than a trillion euros worth of investment in infrastructure networks. Yes, most of these investments will be private, but without European support, without cofinancing on our part, these projects will not see the light of day because of a lack of start-up capital. Let us take another example: we decided to invest nearly EUR 270 billion so that all European households and all our businesses benefit from broadband between now and 2020. However, if we had waited for private investment alone to achieve this, we would only have reached EUR 50 billion. That would mean no broadband for Europe as we would be EUR 220 billion short. These investments are necessary for our businesses, however. They create jobs, they stimulate the economy, and they contribute to our competitiveness. The only way to get out of this economic crisis is to develop through investment. Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. Either we learn the lessons of these last 60 years and we work together to relaunch Europe around peace, solidarity and competitiveness, or we trap ourselves in selfish, nationalist positions and founder together.  The 16 Member States plus Croatia who met last week in the European Parliament demonstrated that there is a core of Member States who want to move forward together. We, in the European Parliament, are going to defend our position on the budget. We will defend the European aid programme for the poor, which you mentioned. The proposal to reduce this programme by EUR 400 million is unacceptable. We will not allow this programme to be touched, even if we have to make an effort on all the other budget lines. It is out of the question to sacrifice aid to our poorest citizens, especially since their number will grow with the crisis. We have to fulfil this responsibility in order to support the NGOs that look after these people voluntarily. Removing this funding from the budget is not really a sign of solidarity; it is exactly the opposite. I am counting on this Parliament: we must not allow this position to be attacked. We will defend the Europe in which we believe: not a sum of countries that pick and choose from the menu of common policies, but a real union of 27 that is united, responsible and prosperous. We are at a crossroads. It is our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand firm if things do not move in the right direction, and it is also our duty to go beyond the selfish, national positions in our various countries to pave the way for the Europe of the future.

Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am, by nature, an optimistic person. My optimism is realistic, however. It is based on concrete elements, on facts and accomplishments, and on experience of everything we have achieved in the past 60 years, which, in the end, is just a start. The Nobel Prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of what we have built together over 60 years. However, it is also encouragement to go further, and I believe in Europe. I believe in the Community method. I believe in the added value that the European Union offers through its common policies. I also believe, however, in the European investment that allows our budget to inject some EUR 100 billion into our economies every year, and it is by no means enough. Europe needs these ambitious policies, policies that are going to help us to restore growth, but to implement them, we need an ambitious budget. I think that the debate here has clearly demonstrated that. I therefore appeal to everyone to face up to their responsibilities. We need a financial framework that matches our ambitions and, above all, we need an agreement at the end of the year if we want to appear credible to the outside world, Mr President. Last week’s European Council took a further step towards achieving our economic union. Our crisis is an economic crisis, but our mistake has been to fail to meet our commitments and comply with the rules that we set ourselves. In recent months, we have faced up to our responsibilities here, in this Parliament, and we have introduced the necessary instruments. The ‘economic governance’ package now has force of law but it has to be applied. The same goes for the ‘two-pack’ that we are discussing today. I think that we are going to conclude that very soon. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the lessons of this crisis is that we cannot exclude certain sectors, such as the banking sector, from our common laws. My group is aware of that, which is why we support the Council’s proposal to establish a European bank supervisor. In our economy, everything is connected. The slightest failure, the collapse of a single bank, affects the entire system. The banks may think that they are too big to fail, but no bank is too small to be supervised. We are convinced of this: our citizens, our businesses and the banks themselves need to have confidence in our financial system. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will make every effort to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from this crisis and that our European Union is reinforced because we believe that Europe is the solution. For some 20 years, the single market has been our success, but for that success to last, we must complete it and finish our work. We must force the Heads of State or Government to quickly fill in the gaps in the single market. I am thinking, in particular, about the establishment of the digital single market. If we do not do this, we will lose a turnover of EUR 1 billion every year. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroads. Some people want to do away with some of the European Union’s competences and reduce Europe to an economic free trade area. Europe is much more than that, however. Since the signature of the Treaty of Rome by our founding fathers, the European project has been synonymous with peace and prosperity. That has now been rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize. For 60 years, Europe has set an example in the world. Our role tomorrow is to strengthen the social market economy, increase our solidarity, continue to defend human rights and, above all, spread our values throughout Europe and beyond. President-in-Office of the Council, as I have said often here in this House, in times of crisis we need to take decisions. When we take decisions, it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes, but the worst thing to do in a crisis is to wait for too long. If we wait for too long, we will eventually cost our fellow citizens billions of euros. That is my appeal to you, and I hope that we will see a very good European budget before the end of the year. That will be proof of our commitment for the outside world and the markets. I wish you the very best of luck; I hope that you have the determination to reach your goal and bring us a nice Christmas present at our December part-session. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank José Manuel Barroso for his address, his speech, his analysis and his realism. We are back after summer break and, as is the case each year, we have two things to do: take stock of the past twelve months and discuss the future of the European Union. I think we are heading in the right direction now. What I mean is that we need to continue along the road towards greater European integration We also need more specific reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking about the crisis for three years now. We know that we were living beyond our means for too long, we know that we need greater discipline and a return to balanced budgets. Only then will we be able to invest in our future generations. We know the ways out of the crisis. In economic terms, what we have done over the last three years, we have done too slowly, and that has cost us billions. As for the economic governance package, the Euro Plus Pact, the European Semester, the Single Market Act, and in some sectors, for example, the banks, the need for European solutions is evident. Banks are no longer national, but transnational. A failing bank can bring down the entire banking system. This is why my group supports your proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism in the banking sector. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that our solutions are positive and we have examples to back this up. Although, I have not written it down on my sheet here, you have made me realise that there are also some positive examples. I think that the governments that have made the most reforms in Europe also belong to our political family. I am thinking about our friend Mr Dombrovskis. Although his is a small country deep in crisis, he got it out of crisis and there is now meaningful growth. Here too, as I see it, is an example, and he did it without having to rely too much on European solidarity. In his speeches, he stressed that in this deep crisis the only money he had to invest, was money he received from the EU budget. I think this needs to be given some thought because, unlike some, we realised how serious the situation was. We know that our economies are in bad shape and that the only way to get them better is a complete cure. To kick start this, we need a change of habits. We need large-scale rather than small-scale reforms. Yes, it is hard, but what choice do we have? For these reforms to succeed, we must also promote competitiveness and growth. My group supports those governments that are going down this route. I would also like to make another point. European solidarity should not be confused with charity. That is why I support the European Central Bank’s proposal to buy bonds because any State that benefits from this solidarity must act responsibly. Without a programme of reforms offering credible proposals, a State cannot receive this aid. This is the right approach. It is a European approach and, by bolstering States in difficulty, it is Europe, as a whole, that we are strengthening. Ladies and gentlemen, I will say it again, 20 years after it was introduced, we have still not completed the single market. Mr Barroso, I am appealing to you again. We must, as a matter of urgency, develop an action plan with precise deadlines to finish the job we started. The rules on the single market should be simple, consistently applied and implemented as a single package. For example, because of red tape, 23 million European SMEs still have no access to all 27 markets. Let me tell you that one job created in each of these 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises – if you tot it up - is a significant number. That is why my group has called for a reduction in red tape by 2015. At least 50% less paper: think of the trees saved for the environment. By doing this, we are giving European companies the chance to create jobs. The Commission must play a full part and have no hesitation in enforcing the law. Publish lists of States that have still not implemented the directives and force them to do so. Use your powers! Governments are frequently challenging us Europeans. Everything is always our fault. Let them, then, take some responsibility too. I call on you, Mr President, to define new, concrete fields in which the European institutions should intervene. I am convinced that there is a very simple remedy for the current crisis: it is more Europe, yet more Europe and more Europe again. What we need is fiscal and social harmonisation. Our joint actions and policies are successful. Let me give you one example that will surely surprise you: agricultural policy. This truly is a joint policy which has ensured food security – as you mentioned – during periods of significant fluctuations. It has also got entire regions out of poverty. This policy must remain European. Above all, we must not do what many are now calling for and renationalise it. That would be a disaster. This is a European policy that been successful and must remain European. To take another example, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment. No country can solve this problem on its own. Even if this comes under national jurisdiction, again, it is time to find a European solution. Again, I am thinking about this extra job in each of the 23 million SMEs. It might make you all smile, but not me: twenty-three million extra jobs with a European policy for youth employment; that should make you think. Ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Mr President, we are in the throes of an unprecedented storm. There are those in Europe and elsewhere, who would be only too pleased to see the euro collapse. Personally, I do not want to give them that pleasure and nor do you, José Manuel. Besides, why do the credit rating agencies prefer to attack the euro, rather than judge the country they know best where their head office is? They are not making the same analyses. I know why but, all the same, it is not right. We must face this storm, not by plastering up the cracks, but by strengthening our foundations. We must not repeat past mistakes. Creating an economic union without an accompanying political union is inconceivable. Our credibility is at stake. Mr President, let us show some European ambition. Europe makes decisions that affect 500 million Europeans. These decisions should be taken under democratic control, by the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage. The place of democratic legitimacy is here in Parliament, and I thank President Schulz for having refocused matters. We are elected democratically. I therefore think we should be recognised democratically. The so-called ‘four presidents’’ proposal aiming at real economic and monetary union is ambitious but it needs to be more so and Parliament should also be involved in this. Concentrating only on economic reforms is the wrong way to go because the economic crisis has become a political crisis, a crisis of confidence – as you rightly pointed out at the end. Now, I agree on a Treaty change in the medium and long term, but this is not the solution we need in the immediate future. Because I am French, all we need is for some Rules of Procedure to be applied to fiscal and social policies, and to be included in the Treaty when we have time to think. Now is the time for action. The latest Eurobarometer struck me. It reveals that a majority of Europeans think that Europe is indeed a good thing. But in many Member States, more and more of our citizens do not feel European. It is our duty - as you said - to explain the added value, but it is also the duty of all national leaders. For me, a good, responsible politician is like a good doctor. Both have to explain things, both have to tell the truth, both have to convince you, even if you do not want to hear it. We need to discuss the next steps of our integration with this reality in mind. Ladies and gentlemen, I am calling for more Europe, not more power for the sake of having power. We must build a Europe that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. This is why we want the 2014-2020 EU budget to have a credible, solid and ambitious framework, as it has been prepared by the Commission and Parliament. Here too, the Heads of State or Government are being held to political account and it will show our citizens whether or not we want more Europe. The European budget is not a budget of spending, but a budget of investing. It is a forward-looking budget, a budget for growth. Let us be serious and ambitious. I call on all those responsible to find a solution before the end of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, judges will today rule on the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Here in Parliament, we champion democratic control at European level. We also need to have the courage to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg when we think that our rights are not being respected. We must go before the Court frequently, as others do, and I am sure that will also strengthen Parliament. This is also why we need a real political Europe. A Europe where Parliament is the only direct representative of the citizens of Europe. If we do not do this, we will fail. Political union is legitimacy, it is more democratic control, more citizen participation. This is the Europe that I believe in. These are the values that our group supports. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Cyprus is taking over the Council presidency at a decisive moment for Europe. I said here, only yesterday in fact, that the European Council has held 30 meetings on the economic crisis and it is not over yet. Thirty meetings and only last week did we see the start of an action plan. That is why I am calling this morning on the new Presidency to show courage and determination. I hope that this Presidency will convince its 26 partners to opt for an integrated Europe, a political Europe and, at last, a united and therefore sovereign Europe. The economic crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge relates to the competitiveness of our economy and to unemployment, which is breaking records with an average rate of 11%. The opportunity is to do what the countries in the euro area should have done at the outset, in other words implement a common economic policy, a policy of balanced budgets and, above all, a long-term investment policy. President Christofias, although you and I are from radically opposed political parties, my group supports the priorities of your Presidency. In particular, I heard you use an expression that is very important to me: the Community method. In that respect, I know that I can count on you. Like you, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants the European Union to be more effective, more relevant and more efficient and to experience renewed growth. On that basis, we need to act. We need to take advantage of the 20th anniversary of the single market in the autumn to complete, at last, the work that began under Jacques Delors and implement the Single Market Act as quickly as possible. We need to apply the Services Directive in full. We need to create a genuine digital single market. We also need to reduce the burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. All of these measures will create growth and will thus create jobs. These are the measures that I am asking you, Mr President, to take along with this Parliament and in close cooperation with the Commission. There is another key aspect of your Presidency: the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. My group truly hopes that progress is made in this regard during the next six months, in the knowledge that the European budget is an investment budget, a growth budget and an employment budget. We need investment in all 27 Member States in infrastructure, investment in all 27 Member States in energy networks and in education, research and innovation, cohesion policies and food security; you spoke about food aid for the most deprived, I believe, and you also have my support in that regard. That is a credible and tangible response to the crisis, too. The Cypriot Presidency will find in the European Parliament an active and committed participant when it comes to the financial perspective, as long as the proposed budget is large enough and tailored to our needs. We will be keeping an eye on that, but we will help you to reach the end of the year with a Christmas package for this budget for the multiannual financial framework. Now, Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen – do not laugh, Mr Barroso, the package will be good, you will see – I would like to talk about another issue before you here this morning and that is the worrying political situation that has prevailed for a number of days in one of our Member States, Romania. Yesterday the Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, expressed grave concern. I quote: ‘I am seriously concerned about recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania. For me, a well-functioning, independent judicial system is a precondition for mutual trust in the European area of justice’. My group shares the Commission’s concerns and last week I, myself, expressed my concerns about the current state of democracy in Romania. This morning, I ask the Commission very sincerely to continue to monitor this issue as it has monitored others, in spite of the summer break. It is important for us to make progress over the next six months on various issues that are on the table and, President Christofias, we are counting on you. There are a lot of good things that you can do. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the thirtieth European Council dedicated to the crisis. Although, in comparison to previous meetings, we are closer to reaching the desired solution, the road map towards European political integration is still not forthcoming. Of course, this time, substantial progress has been achieved. Following the country-specific economic recommendations proposed by the Commission, the document presented by Mr Van Rompuy is a step in the right direction, as it finally refers to political Europe as the ultimate aim. He mentions a preparation period spread over 10 years. Yet, each of us knows that Europe will not survive between now and 2022 without budgetary, fiscal and social integration. I often wonder what political development the Twenty-Seven will judge sufficiently serious in order to consent to shared sovereignty. I wonder what graver problems are necessary, other than unemployment, the difficulties experienced by our companies, the prohibitive interest rates that our Member States must pay, in order to prove that a single currency must include a common economic policy. Having said that, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is satisfied with the advances contained in the Growth and Employment Pact, even though this contains some of the long-standing proposals already put forward by this Parliament and the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you must continue, together with Parliament, to put whatever is needed on the table, because when the Heads of State or Government come together, they are unable to find a solution. For each of them, it is a question of survival in their own countries. Therefore, we need Parliament, together with the Commission and Mr Van Rompuy, to come forward with, and put on the table, concrete proposals so that when governments find themselves strangled by the markets and suchlike, they may have a solution, as was the case with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’. My group supports the system of banking supervision, the proposal for a European guarantee and the European banking union project. Our fellow citizens must know that their savings are protected at all levels and that the instruments used to guarantee them are going in the right direction. Here too, we must strengthen protection. We need to guarantee the savings deposits of people who have worked all their lives, and you know we have problems with this issue at the moment. What now remains is the implementation of the instruments. That is why I again call upon the Commission, the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure this happens. The PPE Group also supports the EUR 10 billion increase in capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Indeed, we must ensure that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can finance their projects, keep their employees, in the first instance and, above all, be able to hire new staff. Although the provisions on the single market remain insufficient, project bonds, which were decided upon last Friday, are a step in the right direction. I welcome this move, insofar as it does not consist of supplementary funds that no longer exist, but rather better use of existing European funds. I would like to highlight here that last month, the Latvian Prime Minister once again came to speak to our group in order to tell us that, faced with the imperative of budgetary cuts that were being forced upon him, he has only been able to restart his country’s economy thanks to European funds. This is an example that must be repeated. The Latvian Prime Minister did it and he informed his citizens. Thanks to European solidarity, combined with the courage of its leaders, this country has restored growth and employment. Just because it is a small country does not mean that we cannot emulate this example. We do not talk enough about these amazing examples for Europe. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we see that the solution to the majority of our problems lies in having more Europe. It is for that reason that my group places so much importance on the next multiannual financial framework, which is presently under discussion, as it will allow us to continue to finance our common policies. These funds constitute the base of European solidarity and are an essential instrument for growth and employment. In the 1950s, European integration was necessary to guarantee peace and security in our continent. Today, this same integration is essential in order to protect our European social model which we have patiently constructed. It is essential in order to defend our common interests in international trade. It is essential for the promotion of our values and our humanist ideals, human rights, human dignity, transparency and the rule of law. That is why I repeat my call for a politically integrated Europe, not an intergovernmental Europe, as was supported by the Council in the Schengen case, or again last week concerning the issue of patents. For as long as the Community method is not our governance rule, nor that of the Council, Europe will lose ground. I know you have a difficult job, Mr Van Rompuy, but fear not! Make proposals with us, with Parliament and the Commission, to these Heads of State or Government who, as I said, do not have the capacity for reflection as they are obligated to manage their very difficult issues on a daily basis in each of their respective countries. We need a much more integrated Europe. We must compare what works, the countries that cope – because there are some – and apply their example to those that work less well. There you have what I want us to put on the table, Mr Barroso, during the next two months. We will reflect further on this during the holidays and then we will make proposals in September, if the markets allow us to do so. Joseph Daul  (PPE

Blue-card question.

Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, allow me to ask a question as I, like you all, am very worried. If you look at the statistics, they show that from September onwards, we will increasingly see a situation in which some countries will have made unswerving efforts over a period of several years, and other countries will not have made such efforts. These countries will refuse to continue and will no longer be able to pay for solidarity because things are going badly for them. Therefore, in the Democrat groups, we must also, from August onwards, discuss the formulation of real proposals. For we cannot spend money that we do not have. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that the Member States tackled the real problems and had the courage to answer the real questions. It is time for the European Council to finally adopt tough measures on 28 and 29 June, rather than settle for fall-back mechanisms that are immediately overtaken by events. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), these real questions in actual fact boil down to one: are we ready to make the necessary political leap to make the European Union and the euro area work? This is a question that could not be asked two years ago. Are we both clear-headed and politically courageous enough to defend and organise shared political sovereignty, or are we going to allow our laws, our policies, our societal choices to be dictated by the financial markets and banks, as we have been doing for two years now, lurching from one crisis Council to the next? (Applause)
 We must assume our responsibilities once and for all. What we want is a European Union with a social and fiscal model, and we need to show this. This is a difficult time and, in times of crisis, we move forwards and not backwards. We have to face reality and stop deluding ourselves. The reality is that no country in Europe can tackle global challenges, whether economic, social, demographic, military or political, single-handedly. We see this every day. Each Member State says, ‘I do not need Europe, I do not need Europe,’ and, the next day, it asks for help. Members of the Council, the reality is that, over the last 60 years, we have achieved peace and prosperity and that this has been possible thanks to a method, the Community method. I believe deeply in this method, just as I am convinced that Europe is the solution and not the problem. So, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 and 29 June, notwithstanding such important issues as economic governance, the credibility of the euro, and financial perspectives, the PPE Group will, first and foremost, call on the Member States to make a choice, a major choice that will determine the rest: do you want to ensure a future for Europeans and to focus on what is really important, which is to ensure strong political integration through the Community method? Or do you prefer to keep on pretending that you have economic sovereignty only to find, the day after each summit, the day after each meeting of Finance Ministers, that the decisions taken are inadequate and untimely and that we are heading for disaster? Do you prefer, as you did on 7 June in relation to Schengen, to withdraw to your borders and fall back on your intergovernmental arrangements? If you go for the first option, Parliament will be happy to work with you to find lasting solutions to the problems of our fellow citizens. However, if the Council stubbornly refuses to agree on the main issues, we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel in the short term. Those are my requests to the Council. I would also like to request that the President of Parliament be finally given the opportunity to debate with the Heads of State or Government all the subjects that will affect the future of Europeans. The President of the Commission has his place in the Council, as does the President of the Central Bank. Is the democratically elected President not as worthy as the President of the Central Bank? (Applause)
 The person who represents 500 million Europeans, presides over the only institution elected by universal suffrage, and who leads the institution that legislates with the Council is asked to leave the Chamber after he has given his presentation. What democracy, what transparency can we demonstrate to the outside world? European integration cannot be achieved without the democratic legitimacy embodied by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, I will end by saying – and I know that you repeat things time and again, as we do, in this Chamber – that we need to continue to make recommendations. We need to continue to table new proposals on social and fiscal union and we must not be afraid to publicise them. Go ahead – Parliament is with you. We are the driving force behind the proposals, and the Council needs us in the difficult crisis situation in which it finds itself. It needs to find solutions and we need to put them on the table, even more so than we have done so far. You can count on us. I would also like you to go further and publish, every three months, an up-to-date table of the economic and social measures on the internal market taken by each of our governments, both on the right and on the left. Europeans need to know which Member States are making an effort to get their public finances back in shape and to promote growth and jobs and are not just talking about doing so. All these proposals need to be continued. We are going to haul Europe out of the crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, what the PPE Group wants is honesty with regard to our fellow citizens and, above all, a great deal of political courage. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 I think I have always had the courage to say what I think and I have had it all my life.

 Mr President, I will try to stay calm, even though I am absolutely seething. Minister, we had already been provoked, and you have provoked us even further this morning. However, I will stay calm. (Applause)
 By deciding unanimously, against the opinion of the European Commission, to alter the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the interior ministers have made a decision that is completely unacceptable to the Group of the European People’s Party. I would like to thank Ms Malmström for the courage she showed right to the end. She did not bend under pressure from the Council. (Applause)
 Ms Malmström, we will need the Commission over the next few weeks, as the debates will be tough. Minister, I am surprised that you did not introduce visas at the same: you would have protected our 500 million consumers even more. (Applause)
 By proposing this initiative, you have broken the bond of trust with this Parliament: this initiative has broken the fundamental principle of the community method in a very dangerous way and, as you know, I am very attached to that principle. You have attacked it and you will find us blocking your way. This principle prevents the larger Member States from imposing their will on the smaller States. It ensures that Europe’s general interest comes before national interests. You have broken that, my friend. The European Parliament and Commission are the guardians of this community method, and we have no intention of giving up on it. Last Thursday, I asked the Presidency of the Council, in the person of Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is a former member of the European Parliament herself, to appear before this Parliament to explain her position. She telephoned me yesterday evening, and I think she ought to have been here this morning, because the community method is important and she knows what she is talking about. The Danish Presidency does not have enough respect for Europe’s 500 million citizens to even bother to tell them why it has denied its Members of Parliament the right of codecision on a subject as important as freedom of movement. As far as I am concerned, since the evening of 7 June, the Danish Presidency is over. Between now and midnight on 30 June, we will address either the Council or the incoming Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus. You should know that I had to think long and hard before saying that, but you have broken the community method. That is something that must not be done. (Applause)
 At a time when the economic and social crisis we are going through calls for a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and respect from everyone and from all our national and European leaders, you have broken that respect. By withdrawing their trust in Parliament, the Member States are going in the opposite direction to the one that will allow us to come out of the crisis from the top down: in other words, via political integration between us. The solution to our problems is not to withdraw behind our borders; quite the opposite: the solution is shared sovereignty and joint management, in a spirit of mutual trust and of respect for the thing we hold most dear: our freedoms. Our group asks the Council to reverse its decision. Only by doing this will it be able to come back to this European Parliament. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are celebrating Europe. This celebration on 9 May is particularly significant at a delicate time for European integration in economic terms, but also in political terms. We often forget the progress our countries have made since signing Robert Schuman’s declaration, yet never in our history have we known such an area of peace and prosperity in spite of the current crisis. We Europeans have paid a high price to understand that there is no difference between our neighbours and ourselves. We know at last the value of tolerance, of dialogue, of solidarity, which take precedence over individualism. Ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism and the lure of populism require our attention. Left-wing populism has no more place in Europe than right-wing populism. I urge all the mainstream political parties to remember that they have nothing to gain and everything to lose if extremism becomes commonplace. Intellectual shortcuts and easy solutions are mere demagogy. They simply entertain the false hopes of our citizens, which quickly come to nothing. How, then, in this context, can we reduce Europe’s democratic deficit? As I said, Europe is experiencing a difficult period and the decisions that will be made over the coming months will determine the stability of our economies and the social cohesion of our countries. The debt crisis and the recent attacks on the markets against our currency have at least had the merit of making us aware of the deterioration of public finances that has been going on in several European countries for decades. We have shown, in Parliament, with the ‘six-pack’, with the fiscal treaty, and soon with the ‘two-pack’ as well, that Europe has demonstrated the courage to take itself to task and reverse this trend. However, our efforts have only just begun and we must under no circumstances relax them. I must say, what worries me most is this current political debate between growth and cleaning up national finances. Indeed, behind the caricatures, it is not that there are those in Europe who are in favour of good management and those who are in favour of growth, simply because they are two sides of the same coin, as I have often said here in this Chamber. The reality is that we cannot separate deficit reduction and growth, and you have said so yourself. There will be no sustainable growth unless we reduce our debts and this reduction will come about all the more quickly with strong growth. The reality is that growth-stimulating measures cannot be synonymous with additional spending. We no longer have the resources. The reality is that, as long as the most spendthrift countries refuse to lead debt-reduction policies, the countries that are themselves making an effort towards sound management will no longer be able to show solidarity. Ladies and gentlemen, confidence is what will come from investment and growth. I am not talking about artificial growth. There is only one way to achieve this: enhancing the competitiveness of our economies in the context of globalisation. Europe has a promising future so long as we all assume our responsibilities and we implement the decisions that have already been adopted. We know very well what is needed: completing the single market, investing in research and development to continue to play the leading role among 21st century economies, and reducing administrative burdens to unlock the potential of our SMEs and our companies. It is in this way, and by cleaning up our public finances, that we will ensure growth and that we will create jobs for the future. Robert Schuman’s declaration paved a new way for Europeans. Now more than ever, we are bound together. We are united, responsible for one another, and this involves budgetary convergence, which is under way, but also fiscal and social convergence. Yet this solidarity can only work if each of us makes efforts and is ready to combine cleaning up public finances with sustainable growth. You know that Robert Schuman’s declaration brought us a project for peace, which has been a success. Let us say it too. However, I should like to finish with these words: solidarity, responsibility, enthusiasm, conviction and let us have a project for the future, for growth and for employment. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of European fiscal discipline, we have achieved a lot in a short space of time. What we did was necessary, because in 2008 and last autumn, we were on the brink of disaster and we almost lost everything: the euro, our financial system, but, above all, our credibility in the world and our social model. We now have the instruments for greater discipline. We needed to do all of this so that Europe could regain its credibility. We needed to do all of this to create the conditions for a return to growth. Growth which, being the only way to get us out of crisis, must be at the heart of our debates, starting with this afternoon’s. We cannot achieve growth by passing laws, but what we can do is create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth. How so? Firstly, by focusing on European policies for growth and employment and putting others on hold. This means acting quickly to conduct a qualitative audit of European public expenditure so that we can make informed decisions. The EU budget must be one of the key instruments for kick-starting the European economy. Therefore, having done it with fiscal discipline, I propose a joint initiative committing us to growth, an initiative that would make the EU budget a reserve for investment for all of us. The growth principle needs to be the equivalent of the principle of subsidiarity. This principle would mean that each proposal, each EU policy would, in future, have to demonstrate how it contributes to growth. No potential for growth, no money. That should be our rule for the next two years. This principle would mean that we could, for example, examine the issue of trade agreements. Are we gaining market shares or are we losing them? Are we gaining jobs or are we losing them? Another point close to my heart, as you know, is the single market. Twenty years after its launch, as I have already said and I will go on saying, we have a duty to achieve it fully. Our 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises need it, because unlike the major players, they cannot adapt to the competitiveness gaps that still exist today. We therefore have to do it for our SMEs, the very ones who, over the past decade, have created 85% of new jobs. Business leaders are now being accused of being rich. Did you know that, like me, these bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises earn at most just EUR 1 000 to 1 200 and are looking for contracts that will guarantee employment to the workers of their SMEs. Here, too, Mr Barroso, we need to support them so that the banks offer finance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Instead, they are dropping them, and that is not right. We need to establish a more effective support. We need to adopt a much stricter approach in order to maintain support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These are jobs that exist and we do not want to lose them. On the completion of the single market, let me add another point: we need to reduce paperwork and red tape which, alone, costs our economy nearly EUR 40 billion. We need to simplify matters in order to move on. Ladies and gentlemen, the growth we need to kick-start our economy is not the growth of the future. What we need, right now, is to rapidly increase the added value that these companies bring. What we need is productivity gains in public services. What we need is an employment policy adapted to the new situation and I welcome the proposals adopted by the Commission this morning in this regard. The markets have already shown renewed confidence in the Union. This confidence will remain thanks to the unprecedented discipline and solidarity of Europeans. Such solidarity was inconceivable just two years ago. I also welcome the Commission’s plan for putting the Greek economy and its public finances back on a sustainable path and for guaranteeing financial stability in that country and in the euro area as a whole. It is now up to our Greek friends, whose courage I commend, to stay the course, before and after the upcoming elections. Ladies and gentlemen, we must make the most of this new impetus to step up a gear and urgently refocus the EU’s action and budget on real growth. I would like to thank the Commission – José Manuel and his team – for their work, which is no mean feat, and I also call on the Member States to move up a gear as they are the ones with deficits. It is now time for them to move back up into top gear to restore growth and jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 I will do what my friend, Georges Marchais, used to do. I did not understand the question but I will give you an answer anyway. Anyhow, my dear friend, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is responsible for what is happening in the various countries as we shoulder our responsibility. If we have made mistakes, then we need to accept where we went wrong. That is the first point. As for the second, I do not understand what you are saying about my group. We voted for the ‘six-pack’, that was the first point. We are currently preparing the ‘two-pack’, and I do hope it will be based on the growth and employment model favoured by you. As I way saying … I do not really know what you were driving at … I am also a company director working on a voluntary basis to manage my company employing just 160 people. I do not get a penny from it. We have faced difficulties four or five times now and, each time, with the help of my employees, we have managed to get ourselves out of trouble. However, we are not yet out of the crisis and that is why I maintain that it is vital that we keep the jobs we have and create new ones. That is my answer, my dear friend. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, you are aware of what is happening in Argentina as concerns the threat of nationalising YPF, a company in which the Spanish group Repsol is a shareholder. We are calling for a debate with a resolution because we wish to protect European investments in third countries and, more specifically, to react to the unilateral and arbitrary decision taken by the Argentinean authorities. We are calling for this debate to take place tomorrow and for a resolution to be drafted that we can work on and later put to the vote. We do not need to adopt it tomorrow. We can do it on Thursday. That is our group’s request. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your appointment, and I wish you a great deal of courage for the next two and a half years, since we all need good proposals to create jobs in Europe. I think there are two lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The first is putting national and regional finances back on track, and it can wait no longer. The signing of the fiscal treaty, with 25 members, two days ago, shows that this lesson has been learnt by the most far-sighted countries of the EU. The treaty imposes an obligation on its signatories to show good faith, honesty and discipline. However, everyone knows that actually applying a provision is more important than signing it. This is where we are waiting for the Member States, and for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties. Everyone remembers how the Stability Pact was infringed by the largest Member States. Everyone remembers that a certain President of the Commission even called it ‘stupid’. I therefore welcome the fiscal treaty which is, with the ‘six-pack’ and, soon, the ‘two-pack’ as well, a useful instrument. However, I would like to call for vigilance regarding how they are actually applied. The second lesson to learn from the crisis is the emphasis to be placed on a return to sustainable growth and growth that creates jobs. I must say that, in this area, there has been no real progress since the start of the crisis. The Council meeting in January merely contented itself with making recommendations to the Member States, without any coordination or overall plan. As for the Commission, it is working extremely hard, but the many initiatives it is undertaking would be better understood and more effective if they formed part of an overall project, particularly a project for growth and employment. Above all, I am struck by the difficulty and also the slowness with which too many Member States are applying the rules to which they have, nonetheless, made a commitment. On this point, I also expect the Commission to be more vigilant in its efforts to put Member States back on the right path. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is proposing two courses of action, which it will place on an official basis in a public letter to the Council and the Commission. The first area concerns the internal market. At the end of this year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market. However, 20 years on, there are still more than 150 bottlenecks hampering the operation of that market. It is for this reason that I am calling not only for us to ensure that the rules that have been adopted are actually applied, but also for a legislative package to be put forward, together with a precise timetable to enable us to complete the internal market. This is an urgent matter and within in it we can find, as I say every day, at least a small percentage of growth for all the countries, which is very important at this difficult time. The services sector, which is vital for Europe’s economy, constitutes in itself one of the largest blockages. Prices vary within the European Union; they can be up to twice as high for medicines, three times as high for medical treatments, four times as high for certain kinds of insurance and 100 times as high for the same university qualifications. When we know this, it is clear that action can wait no longer. Of course, we cannot do everything at once. It is for this reason that I call upon the Commission to start with a new legislative initiative in 10 sectors of the internal market. The second course of action recommended by the PPE Group concerns the investments needed for growth. I am also proposing, on this point, that in the European budgets for the next few years, a share allocated to investments generating growth and jobs should be protected. Let me be clear: it is not a question of new expenditure or additional budgets, but of channelling funds that are already available towards sustainable investment. Finally, we must provide ourselves with our own resources. It is not widely enough known that one euro invested by the EU can produce, through its multiplier effect, up to EUR 5 in investment. To take the example of energy, in 2010, the EUR 4 billion injected into the sector ended up generating EUR 22 billion in investment. I will finish with this: our fellow citizens, particularly young people, need jobs now. Our economy needs small growth to begin with and guaranteed growth for the future. The budget pact will ensure healthy and honest finances. Mr Barroso, I believe that on this point, you are right. We must combat tax evasion more rigorously. You have quoted the figures, and it is an enormous problem. We must act to create jobs, while the completion of the single market and the protection of the investment budget ought to generate sustainable growth and jobs. Joseph Daul  (PPE

Mr President, I would simply like to know what the reaction of my friend Guy Verhofstadt is, since Mr Sarkozy does not have a representative of the Front national

The second thing I would like to ask him is this: when Neelie Kroes says that Greece must leave the euro, I have never heard Mr Verhofstadt criticise the suggestion. Please answer these questions.

 Madam President, Vice-President Reding, thank you for being here and thank you, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council for attending this sitting. This afternoon, we are talking about racism and discrimination. These are serious issues, but they are clearly not serious enough in the eyes of the Dutch Prime Minister for him to come and debate them with us. Nevertheless, it is because of a partner in his parliamentary majority that we are forced to hold this debate today. Over and above his empty chair politics, I regret, above all, that the Dutch Prime Minister is refusing to distance himself from a website that is racist, violent and misleading. Indeed, it is wrong, first and foremost, to say that European workers do not contribute to the Dutch economy. Throughout Europe, the economy has benefited from the mobility of workers from Central and Eastern Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, although it is not perfect, the internal market, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of the pillars of Europe and there is absolutely no doubt that Dutch companies have benefited from it over those 20 years, as have companies from other countries, and that they have taken advantage of the Central and Eastern European market. Indeed, since 1993, those companies have invested more than EUR 23 billion in Poland, they are the largest investors in Romania and I congratulate them on that. However, beyond the economy, I ask the following question in particular: what message is the Dutch Prime Minister sending when he refuses to condemn the PVV website? That the single market is only for goods and services, and not for workers, men and women? That there are good and bad workers, depending on the passport they hold? The internal market is not a one-way street. Its rules apply to everyone alike. They apply to services, to financial transactions and to workers. I will say it again: Europe is not just a single market; it is also and, above all, a community of values. We know only too well that discrimination, racism and xenophobia led to the darkest pages of our history. Here among us are Members whose parents fought and died to liberate Europe and the Netherlands 60 years ago. Can we in all good conscience remain silent and fail to respond to the incitement to hatred of certain parties? I will simply repeat what the Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke said: ‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) reiterates its moral appeal to the Dutch Prime Minster to condemn the offending website clearly and quickly and, like Ms Reding, I am very pleased that here in this Parliament, the democrats have tabled a joint motion. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trust is the foundation of the single market, the foundation of the European Union. However, the financial crisis has undermined this trust, the trust that our fellow citizens have not only for each other but also for policy makers, and this distrust continues to grow. In the face of this danger, we must be unambiguous. We need measures to restore confidence in the good management of our finances and the Treaty to be signed next month will be one of the cornerstones of this. We also need measures to restore confidence in the governance of the euro and this cannot be achieved by issuing contradictory statements. In this regard, I am very surprised by the statements made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the Commission, who is of the opinion that it would not be a tragedy if Greece left the euro area. I ask the Commission: is this your official position? I would ask the Commission to address this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, after years of imprudent management of public finances in many of our countries, now is the time for change. This applies even more to Greece of course, but we will not avoid spending cuts —and Greece cannot take any more. Our Latvian friends showed the way some years ago, by reforming their public management without any outside help and accepting painful sacrifices that led to a return to growth. That is why, for my part, I also trust in the Greek people’s enormous sense of responsibility and I am not among those who would have them believe they will immediately overcome the crisis without reforming. That said, as I stated just after the last European Council, it will take more to build the economy than growth and employment reforms. However, the package proposed to us at this stage is not, in any way, up to the challenge. I firmly believe this is no longer the time for business as usual. It is time to make commitments on a par with those of the post-war Marshall Plan or even the 1992 single market project. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for Europe to be ambitious. The time has come to establish a project which mobilises all our resources to restore growth and employment. My group expects the European Commission to propose a legislative package of this kind, in close cooperation with Parliament, as we did with the ‘six-pack’. This package could include measures as ambitious as completing the internal market. We need to know which countries are still blocking this market. The Single Market Act, the Services Directive and the European Patent are all being blocked by an absurd dispute over location. This package must also reduce the burdens imposed on our businesses which stifle their competitiveness. In return, leave it to them to commit to providing more employment, above all, for young people. Ultimately, there is no magic formula for overcoming this crisis unless we demonstrate political will, have the courage to tell our fellow citizens the truth and see through our commitments. As a former manager, I can tell you, I have lived through many crises and I would ask the Commission and the Heads of State or Government who are always thinking of the next election — I understand this and therefore, it is up to us, in Parliament and in the Commission, to show them the way, to put forward proposals, bold proposals for major projects, for example — to establish the internal market and condemn those who do not. These are measures, small measures, which together will perhaps allow us to quickly return to 1% growth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

Mr Lambsdorff, I do not wish to be rude but although I know Ms Kroes well, as she has been with us for a long time, I see things differently. If Greece files for bankruptcy, there are some insurers who will pay out 75% to certain companies. If it does not file for bankruptcy, these companies will be forced to give up 75%, or even 100%, of what they have invested in Greece. I am simply asking the question and we will ask Ms Kroes whether she ever thought about this. Secondly, I spoke to Mr Samaras on the telephone yesterday evening. He expelled 21 members from his party on Sunday. That is what I call a brave man. Have you ever expelled 21 members because they didn’t vote in favour of a text? It is clear to me that Mr Samaras does not lack courage. He proved this on Sunday evening. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in this Assembly, we are convinced that Europe must both restore its public finances and find the road to growth. That is what you have just said to us. I would like to say to you, Mr Monti, that the economic reforms that you have undertaken in your country serve as an example of this twin approach. On the one hand, you have continued with many reforms initiated by the previous government, and this too you have told us about. On the other hand, you have made major changes, especially by liberalising some professions. That is the right approach as it will create jobs and stimulate competition. Thanks to your proposal to introduce a type of flexible security, you will strengthen the social market economy, and you will make the labour market more dynamic and more protective too. Your fight against fraud and in favour of a more transparent tax system is equally appropriate and will allow a reduction of the tax burden borne by Italians. My group supports this package of measures which, I will repeat, serves as an example for Europe. I hope that many countries will follow suit, since a return to growth requires us to re-establish a favourable economic and political climate. We also have to give hope back to our fellow citizens, not a false hope that would soon be dashed as it foundered on the realities, but a hope based on the development of a more competitive economy and on the indispensable reforms of our collective lifestyle. Now, like most European countries, the Italian economy is strong, as it is built on a real economy, on competitive sectors that are full of potential. Mr Monti, you have begun to optimise this potential, to free the economy from burdens that were overwhelming it. We must do likewise in all of our countries and take our example from those who do it best. We must promote under-used resources via, as you said, both national and European policies. In particular, we must allow our SMEs, our researchers and millions of Europeans, especially the young unemployed, to develop their potential. This policy requires a spirit of responsibility, the very one that you, my dear Mr Monti, are displaying at the head of your government. For some, there is a great temptation to confuse public spending and investment, as you have said, but it is only through investment that we shall achieve sustainable growth. Former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, used to say that one cannot fall in love with the internal market. On the day after Saint Valentine’s Day, neither can one fall in love with European competitiveness. However, Mr Monti, in the report that you have published on the re-launch of the single market, you laid out some good pointers on how to restore growth and employment. I would like to speak about greater fiscal coordination between the Member States. I would like to speak about a new impulse for political and social support for the integration of the European market. I would like to speak about the internal market which, almost 20 years after its launch in 1993, remains unfinished. You reminded us of this. Mr President, although everyone knows how much I favour the Franco-German engine, to the same extent I wish that, like Italy, other countries would make their opinions, their proposals or even their counter-proposals heard. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome your determined commitment to the Community method and to European integration. Like the European Parliament, you know, Mr Monti, that the return of the intergovernmental method would be a serious mistake, a retrograde step for the 500 million Europeans. I am grateful to you for having punched to your full weight. Carry on opposing this intergovernmental method. You have the majority of this Parliament with you. This Parliament wishes to make another voice heard, that of a united, responsible Europe, that of an integrated, political Europe. We know that we can count on you as an ally in this. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, as we speak, more than 600 people have died in Europe, victims of the cold and, above all, isolation. This is an opportunity to remember that Europe is not just about economics and finance. It is first and foremost about solidarity, and the spell of cold weather affecting our people is an opportunity for us to prove it. Yet what are we seeing? Food supplies for European food aid programmes are at their lowest and here we have called for help for the NGOs in charge of them. Some EU countries have taken these programmes hostage and have only renewed them until 2013, using legal problems as an excuse. We are also seeing that not enough is being done in response to the real scandal of food waste. I am referring here to all that is being thrown away by major supermarket chains every day when we all know that there are organisations that do not have enough food to hand out at the moment. It is high time that we reacted by putting our support networks into action. Having been mayor of a village for many years, I know that it is at local level that things first play out and I welcome the informal assistance networks that have sprung up over the last few weeks. These are the most effective networks and these are the ones we must support. We must also react by extending the European food aid programme. It is also high time that we promoted a common energy policy. What, then, are the facts? Today, people in need are having their gas and electricity cut off because they cannot pay their bills. Yet we are reacting much too slowly in all our countries. Here too, we must call for help. Finally, Mr Barnier, we must update the basic European civil protection project that we are so desperately lacking. We must act to stop the same tragedies and the same emergencies from happening again year after year. We have experienced them and we must be prepared. We must provide our NGOs and our fellow citizens who are dealing with these issues with the necessary means to do so rather than passing them over to large organisations. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, 25 Member States faced their responsibilities by agreeing to sign the fiscal treaty. They decided to fight against the poor budget management which has left us without the necessary room for manoeuvre to stimulate growth and employment. They showed their ability to find European solutions to European problems, even though two Member States decided that they would rather go it alone, which they will live to regret. I have, at this stage, three wishes. The first is that this treaty be ratified as quickly as possible, the second is that it be applied as quickly as possible and the third is that this agreement be fully integrated into EU law, as Parliament has called for. Ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has forced us to rethink our bad habits. It has forced us to respect the rules of balanced budgets, which are obvious, yet so difficult to apply. We must reduce national deficits, which also often cover up regional and local deficits. However, while the decision on this treaty is the correct decision and a positive one, the decision on growth leaves me rather disappointed. This is because combating deficits and stimulating growth are two sides of the same coin. One without the other will not help Europeans to escape from the difficulties they are facing, particularly the unemployed. There are two ways of boosting growth: one is artificial and has no future, the other is structural and therefore sustainable. The first is to kick-start the economy through spending. That is what we have been doing for years and look where it has brought us. Never mind the fact that, today, spending is actually limited, as the time has come to repay our debts, and not to borrow. The second method, the one recommended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is to make our economy more competitive. This could already be done, Mr Barroso, by finally completing the internal market. All the laws, all the texts were adopted long ago. The problem, once again, is that they have not been applied. I therefore call on the Commission to let us know as soon as possible which countries are not applying these rules and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties by placing restrictions on those which do not apply them – perhaps even France, my friend, as I make no exceptions. All Europeans should know which States are playing the internal market game, and which States are slowing it down or standing in its way. Increasing our competitiveness could also be achieved by reducing the charges that weigh heavily on entrepreneurs and by reducing the considerable discrepancies in charges between our countries, which harm competitiveness. This could also be done by getting as good a return as possible from European Funds that have been allocated to the States but have not yet been used. The time has come to make the best use of this – considerable – surplus by investing it in common projects to create growth and employment. Finally, growth and job creation can be encouraged by turning public funds, which are not bringing in investments, towards research and innovation, or towards training. With a quarter of young people looking for a job, we must offer them the chance to acquire strong skills and to redirect them anywhere in the EU. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, chairing the Council of Ministers of the Union at this time is not an easy task, but I am sure that, after your training as an MEP, Prime Minister, you are fully equipped for this task. Madam President, I endorse the four priorities under which you have so classically positioned your six months at the head of the Council, namely, responsibility, European dynamism, green Europe and security. I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide. That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however. My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency. I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors. The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method. Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth. Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency. Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens. I wish you all the best for the next six months. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, in 2010 Hungary’s citizens entrusted you by a very large majority with the task of carrying out reforms. You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election. The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature. Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly. Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr President, what we are dealing with today is a fundamental discussion about our values and rights. I would like to ask Mr Swoboda: did this Parliament ever have to ask for a commissioner to be sent to Hungary because of repression under the socialist regime? I have never heard of Parliament having made such a request, and no repression of the sort took place. Do you acknowledge that? Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, for once, I am not the first to speak up, but I would just like to point out that a debate has taken place. We are a democracy. If it is not working properly, the democrats are there to listen, to move things forward and change. You have all been to Hungary, as have I. For the time being, you can still move freely in Hungary and I do believe that we will be able to move around Hungary for a very long time to come. Politics is politics, but in Hungary there is freedom of movement. Yet it is true that it is not just Hungary facing the current difficulties; we are all facing them. This applies to the whole of Europe. The current crisis will increase the number of poor and I do not think that it is the Hungarian Government at fault for this. Nor would I accuse the governments of yesteryear blaming them for the deficits. We all have a duty to find the solutions. I am sure that here we are looking for solutions with Viktor Orbán, as he is no Chavez – a name which it pains me to use here in this debate, in a democracy, in a democratic house, this is one step too far and not normal. He is here, even if he is not perfect. Who is perfect? Let he who is perfect cast the first stone. I think that together we will find a solution. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, my dear Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you and to congratulate our new President. I wish you a great deal of courage, lucidity and strength to guide this institution, which collectively represents 500 million Europeans, in the most dignified and responsible way possible. However, I should firstly like to pay tribute to Nirj Deva and Diana Wallis who also stood as candidates to the Presidency of this institution. I should like to say to them that, although the two main groups in this House took the political decision at the beginning of this term of office to entrust the Presidency of Parliament to one of their own Members in turn, my group respects Mr Deva and Ms Wallis for standing as candidates and thanks them for their contribution to this election. However, this morning, Mr Schulz, I should also like to thank your predecessors and, in particular, Jerzy Buzek, whose capabilities as a statesman, which were already well-known in Poland, have been of great benefit to Parliament. Mr Buzek and, before him, Hans-Gert Pöttering and all their predecessors, starting with Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, all of the Presidents here today who have succeeded one another, have, in their own way, strengthened the powers and competences of this institution. Your political action, Mr President, will follow their lead. Mr President, for years we have had the opportunity to work together as chairs of our political groups. For the most part, I do not share your political convictions and our respective political groups have differing opinions on a number of subjects. This has not stopped us from placing our trust in you because, in the difficult situation facing Europe, what brings us together is far more important than what divides us. You are determined, as you have just told us, Mr President, to defend the European general interest resolutely in the face of diverse national interests. My group can only support you fully in this mission, in this action, knowing that the coming months will be one of the most critical periods that Europe has experienced since its creation. In our view, you have three priorities: defending the Community method, supporting the Community method and safeguarding the Community method. Nothing is more important than defending European heritage, namely, guaranteeing the general interest, protecting the small States from the bigger ones, and respecting their points of view without allowing it to lead to a deadlock. Nothing is more important than coming out of the crisis on top, through greater European integration, and nothing is more important than showing our citizens that the euro will be a strong, sustainable currency, insofar as we are doing what we should have done since its creation, namely, implementing political and economic governance. Finally, nothing is more important than preserving the common good that is solidarity between 500 million Europeans. Ladies and gentlemen, by creating what would become the European Union, the founding fathers have left us with a challenge the likes of which has never been seen, namely, uniting the destiny of countries and peoples who, in the past, tore one another apart and fought against one another for centuries. Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi rose to this challenge, and their successors, to this day, have kept this European dream alive in spite of the economic and internal difficulties, and in spite of a radical shift in the global geostrategic situation. It is our generation’s responsibility not to fail in this task. It is up to us to overcome the financial crisis, the current crisis of confidence, to guarantee our children – and you have said it yourself – not only a viable future, but, above all, a better future. This is a challenge primarily facing you, Mr President, and us, ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives of the people of Europe. It is up to you and us, along with the European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to display enough responsibility to convince our States that shared sovereignty, that real economic and political convergence, are our best tools to face the challenge of growth. Mr Schulz, as President of this institution, you will have to face many external challenges, and the PPE Group will be at your side to help you in the European spirit I have just mentioned. We would also encourage you to transmit this message to countries such as Ukraine, where Yulia Tymoshenko has faced unacceptable treatment, or Syria, where the population’s will to change has been unspeakably repressed. You are also planning to improve the internal functioning of Parliament and I welcome this. Your predecessors have largely paved the way and the recent adoption of a code of conduct is fully in keeping with the desire for greater transparency and greater responsibility from each of the Members. My group will therefore support you on this front. Mr President, from now on, you will be leading an institution unlike any other in the world: a plurinational Parliament, which votes on legislation. For two and a half years, you shall be the leader of a House that does not seek to impose on the Council the idea that we will not overcome our current difficulties by creating a new treaty, a new Parliament, new governance, but that seeks to convince the Council of this. Mr President, we will join forces behind you each time you defend this integrated Europe, this Europe of solidarity, this Europe that delivers innovative solutions. We will join forces behind you each time you plead the case of common European policies, as well as each time you fight for funding to live up to the ambitions of these common policies. Finally, we will join forces behind you each time you defend and promote the ideas and values that are the foundations of our Union beyond our borders, namely freedom, tolerance, respect for the weakest in society and solidarity. Mr Schulz, I wish you every success in your Presidency. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Presidents, Mr Tusk, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, rather than speaking myself, I simply wish to subscribe to your speech. At the end of the day, when it comes to speaking about Europe, your discourse is my discourse, it is ours, the discourse of our group, and indeed the discourse of many people within this Parliament. On 6 July, you gave us your vision of a Europe proud of its values, of its successes, of an inclusive Europe, of a Europe confident in its power to exercise its influence throughout the world. This is a vision that we share. Paradoxically, the current crisis may turn out to be a unique opportunity for Europeans to recover their enthusiasm, to bounce back, providing that we are able to adapt, providing that we are able to change our habits and the way we operate. Prime Minister, you indeed have suffered, and you know what suffering is. The old Europe no longer knows what it is to suffer. President-in-Office of the Council, with your government – I shall use just three of the examples that you have mentioned – you have helped to achieve, over your Presidency, the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance. The Polish Presidency, working in close collaboration with the European Parliament on an ambitious package for strong national public finance management, has shown that the Community method can be effective and can sit very well with the euro and the European Union. Similarly, we can credit to this Presidency progress on the supervision of financial markets. More generally speaking, Poland has been working side by side with the European institutions to advance the notion whereby it is an advantage and a way out of the crisis to share economic sovereignty between the 17, the 17 plus and Poland. As you so rightly said, and as I said yesterday, we must put together a way out of the crisis for our fellow citizens for January/February. Second example: the neighbourhood policy. The Polish Presidency has worked extremely energetically, both on the Eastern front, with the signing of the accession of Croatia, and with the launch, last September, of the Eastern Partnership, with the preparation of the association agreement with the Ukraine, and on the Mediterranean front, with European support for the current democratic process. I thank it for that. The third and final example is that in the field of law, the Polish Presidency has enabled considerable progress to be made both on the protection of patents and on European contract law. I hope that we will still be able to carry these through to completion under your Presidency. My group hopes that these efforts will be rewarded and that the final agreement will be signed in the days to come. President-in-Office of the Council, the Polish Presidency has not just produced legislative texts. It has supported a principle dear to my parliamentary group and to the overwhelming majority of this Parliament, namely, the Community method. Indeed, your country, like all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, is more aware than any other country in Europe of the price of freedom, and the importance of solidarity. You have made effectiveness and respect for other people’s opinions a priority, without seeking to impose your own point of view. For many of our Member States, this is an example worth following. We are counting on you – for when you stand down from the Presidency, you will remain an influential member of the Council – to ensure that this Community method returns and is implemented. I shall finish this speech by inviting every one of you in this House to read attentively Minister Radek Sikorski’s Berlin speech. On 28 November, he reminded us that we Europeans are in the uncomfortable position of standing on the edge of a precipice. If we take action, we can emerge from this situation, if not, we shall plunge into the abyss. The Polish Presidency has helped us to take action together. We now need to continue resolutely along this path. I shall repeat a sentence from a very well-known Pole, John Paul II: ‘Have no fear’. Let us work along the lines that you described this morning. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council opened the way, last Thursday and Friday, to governance of the euro area. It showed that the period of waiting, uncertainty and divisions is now behind us and that an end to the crisis is finally in sight. Twenty-six out of 27 States have demonstrated their desire to revert to a healthy finance policy by establishing strict rules allowing for a return to balanced budgets and a reduction in public debt, and by agreeing to incorporate those rules in their constitutions and ensuring that any instances of non-compliance are punished. Twenty-six out of 27 States have shown a sense of responsibility by ensuring that their main political and economic decisions are taken jointly, and by developing crisis mechanisms to be implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB). Twenty-six out of 27 States have conceded that shared sovereignty is preferable to sovereignty held hostage by markets. In short, the spirit of cooperation has prevailed over the attempt to create divisions. Determination has proved stronger than indecision. Three major issues still need to be resolved: that of the nature of the new agreement, that of the United Kingdom’s place in Europe and the attitude of the 26 towards it, and, finally, that of the crucial ‘growth’ strand of our economic policy. Ladies and gentlemen, since the United Kingdom has refused to support the decision taken by its counterparts, the resulting project is not a Community one, as we were hoping, and as I have often said, but an intergovernmental one. This situation presents us with a number of problems, not only legal problems, but political problems, too. My group calls for the European institutions to be fully involved in the discussions that will culminate in the drafting of the new provisions between now and March, and, in particular, for Parliament to be accorded its rightful place in this process so that it can ensure its democratic legitimacy. I solemnly call upon Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso to work closely with the European Parliament. We must ensure, in fact, that no radical changes are made to the spirit and the letter of what has been done for the last 60 years and what has made European integration the success that it is. Cohesion must continue to prevail over power struggles, something which only the Community method can ensure. The second major issue raised by the decision of 9 December concerns the United Kingdom’s place in Europe, and I will come to this. I respect the decisions that were made but, clearly, the UK’s isolation shows that its government sees the European Union as nothing but a free trade area, and that it has no interest in showing solidarity with, and acting responsibly towards, its partners. To my mind, this calls for a change in behaviour towards the country by the 26 and also, to some extent, within the European institutions. In particular, I believe that the UK rebate should be called into question, since the resources of our fellow citizens should be used for something other than rewarding selfish, nationalist attitudes. Solidarity is not a one-way street. It is time Mr Cameron’s coalition government was made to realise that and was reminded of its obligations, in particular, with regard to the financial regulation rules from which it even requested an exemption, which fortunately was refused. The third and final issue relates to the ‘growth and employment’ strand of our economic policy. Of course, there will be no growth unless we put our public accounts in order, but the Union must now set about strengthening and developing its industrial activities, exports and competitiveness with the same level of energy and coordination. Indeed, Europe will not resolve the crisis permanently without a radical two-pronged approach consisting of sound management, on the one hand, and growth, on the other. As far as Parliament is concerned, I believe that we need to work closely with the Commission, on the basis of the proposals it made two months ago. I believe that we must do so, Mr President, in order to overcome the crisis, and that we must vote by a very large majority in February. This is what I propose as ‘homework’ for the Christmas holiday, and on that note, I wish all of you and your families a very happy Christmas. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to reassure my fellow Member. With Christmas nearly upon us, I have neither a tank nor a Kalashnikov. Therefore, he is not in any danger over the Christmas holiday; you can be sure of that, Lord Dartmouth. Secondly, I clearly said that, if, as I believe, the United Kingdom has given up on showing solidarity with the other 26 States for now, then I do not see why the 26 should make a further concession regarding the budget. Let me be quite clear: this is not a declaration of war; it is simply about ensuring that solidarity is shown between everyone and not just one way. That is all! Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis is turning everything on its head and things are changing at an increasingly dramatic pace: changes in Greece and Italy, with the establishment of governments of national unity, which we welcome; whereas until now, our citizens saw European integration as being far removed from their day-to-day lives, now they are calling for more integration. Well, not everyone, as just yesterday, David Cameron saw fit to attack a Europe to which, last time I checked – yesterday afternoon –, his country still belongs, when what we really want is constructive positions, even from him, on how to emerge from the crisis. Still, all the influential players in the Union acknowledge – as I have been saying for years – that the answer to our problems is not less but more Europe. The solution is Europe. I think some presidents realise this. Those who do not are replaced; which is a good thing. A Europe that needs to be transformed along the lines of integration which should have been done when the euro was created because, I will say it again, the current crisis is not just a crisis of the euro which, this morning, Mr Juncker, was still trading at around 1.35 against the dollar – or 1.34 as it might have dropped a centime, which is still acceptable. The reason for this crisis is the mistake made in setting up a currency without giving it the governance needed to make it work. We need to acknowledge this political error, but, above all, we need to put it right, and very quickly. That is what the euro area Member States are being forced to try and do and, once again, I congratulate the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, which is hard at work but which, in my opinion, is not working quickly enough because when your house is burning down, the fire-fighters get to work and, I tell you, fire-fighters are never criticised. I used to be a voluntary fire-fighter myself. We would sum up after the fire: we would look at what had been lost and what could be improved. That is what I am asking of you, Mr Van Rompuy. Do not be afraid. Be stronger. We will work it out later. However, once again, I want to emphasise the importance of crisis management which is a new source of division in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing it more and more, we need to take care to distinguish between those that are in a deep crisis and those that have managed it better. We need to recognise this. I want to stress how crucial it is that the Seventeen take into account all the instruments of the Euro Plus Pact when making any decisions on governance of the euro area. Mr Juncker, this is your job, do it. There are many countries wanting to join the euro area. We must not create different categories of players in this Euro Plus zone. We must not leave those countries wanting to join warming up on the sidelines. We must not exclude them from strategic decisions taken in the dressing rooms. I want to underline, here, the merit of countries like Poland, which has the Presidency, and which, despite not yet being in the euro area, are making extremely brave efforts, from a political viewpoint, to clean up their finances and boost growth. We should encourage them; we should make them feel a part of our club. Similarly, and I shall say it again, we should not abandon the Community method. As much as I firmly believe that the Franco-German alliance is a key driving force in Europe – which recent weeks have again proved –, I call on all Member States to contribute and go further than Paris and Berlin, instead of complaining about the impetus provided by Paris or Berlin. Nobody is stopping them. Likewise, Mr Barroso, I also call on the European Commission, with your commissioners, to do everything in your power to safeguard, strengthen and shield European cohesion. Do what you can to reassure small and medium-sized States that the Community method is still the glue that holds us together, that makes us stand firm and binds us together. It is in times of difficulty that it needs to be reinforced. That is the main responsibility of both institutions, the European Parliament and the Commission, which stand up for the European general interest. I want to finish my part in the debate on a possible revision of the European Treaties. Yes, changes will definitely need to be made to put right what is necessary. Yes, these will definitely have to be major adaptations, given the significance of the issues at stake. My group is open to this process as long as there is open, democratic debate involving elected representatives and civil society as part of an agreement. Above all, however, we must not fall back into the temptation of spending all our time talking about the mechanical tools, to the detriment of our political objectives. We must not lose sight of what is urgent, namely credible economic governance, and of what is less urgent, and let us do what can and must be done to current treaties, if necessary by making small changes to the rules of procedure as I call them. I am thinking of the establishment of the internal market, of the rules governing financial supervision or credit rating agencies. I am thinking about the political role played by the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for economic and monetary affairs, which is yet to be defined. I am thinking about the rapid implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of macroeconomic surveillance. (The President interrupts the speaker following an interruption off-microphone from Mr Bloom)
 I am thinking about real budgetary, fiscal and social integration. Mr President, it is Europe which speaks while the anti-Europeans scream and shout. That is not my way of moving Europe forward. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, to start with, I would like to point out that in life, one can either see the glass as half full or half empty. I see the glass as half full. I would like to thank you for the work you have done over the last 48 hours, because as a farmer, I know that it is not always the right horse that gets the oats, and this morning I would like to give you the oats and tell you ... (Laughter and applause)
 If he does not like oats, he can give them to the Commissioners; no problem there, a few of them like them. The elements that I picked up straightaway from your speech, and which I want to reiterate here, are that we are dealing with the banks, we are not doing enough to challenge the rich, you understand what I mean by that, but above all, and I thank you for saying it, we need to take care of the poorest. It would be outrageous if we failed to find a solution concerning the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons before the winter months. (Applause)
 Some people thought that everything would be sorted out by Monday. I do not think anyone here in this House believed that, since we are responsible men and women. However, we were still apprehensive, and late last night I watched the news to see whether we would effectively have an even deeper crisis this morning or, as I have often said, whether we would start to see the end of the crisis take shape. I believe this Council has at least come up with an initial solution to the crisis, and I congratulate both of you – I know that it is not easy. Undoubtedly it does not go far enough, but I will come back to this. I also wish to highlight the progress made by the 17 countries in the euro area. Over recent weeks, we have seen the 17 countries in the euro area being criticised by those who are not part of it. I would like to point out, in this Parliament, that we are all Europeans, whether we are inside or outside the euro area. Nevertheless, we have duties and rights, and those who took centre stage the most were the 17. Here too I believe we have made progress. With regard to solidarity with Greece, following the release by the Troika of a new tranche of loans, the agreement announced last night with the banks sees 50% of the debt being written off. This is an achievement. The increase of the European Financial Stability Facility’s firepower is a step in the right direction and, as everyone knows, one of the trickiest aspects of the negotiation. The agreement of the 17 on this point is absolutely crucial. By ensuring that this Fund acts as a credit insurance for investors who buy loan certificates from countries deemed vulnerable, the resources of the Stability Fund will be increased. The third area in which progress has been made is bank recapitalisation. I believe that we have already referred to this. Consequently, the European Council and the euro area have kept their promises for the short term and for part – a small part, I would stress – of the medium term. My group encourages you to progress even more quickly, and you are not on holiday as far as I understand. Tomorrow morning further progress will have to be made. The most important thing is to adopt a new model of economic governance, without which the euro cannot work effectively in the long run. We say the same things every day here, but we can see that by dint of repeating ourselves, some things are starting to be done. This integration and this European policy are an absolute necessity. I note that the countries which are the first to ask the euro area to take strong action have, for years and even decades, vigorously rejected any proposal for fiscal harmonisation. They are quite simply being inconsistent. Ladies and gentlemen, the European project is not about imposing something on someone. The European project is not about placing anyone under supervision, nor about governing with no regard for the democratic balance of powers. However, the rules must be complied with, Mr Barroso, and we must ensure that the measures that have been accepted and signed on paper are truly applied in practice. The European project and the strategy for Europe are about an ambition: that of offering the 500 million inhabitants the chance to live with dignity. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) does not want us to depend in future on Chinese and Brazilian investment, but to draw on our own work and our own know-how. What the PPE Group wants is to map out the route that will lead to that outcome, and that requires a shared European sovereignty between all those who want it. Mr Van Rompuy, yesterday you made good decisions, difficult and brave decisions. Nonetheless, these measures are not the end result of a plan to exit the crisis, they are merely the beginning. I call on the Member States, I call on Members of Parliament, both national and European, and I also call on our fellow citizens to agree to further political integration. I call on this Parliament and, Mr Barroso, on the European Commission, to carry on defending the EU model, which is a model of inclusion and not exclusion. I hope that next week, the G20 will respect the decisions that Europe has taken. For that to happen, though, they must be sure that we will not stop halfway. We need more fiscal and social integration, even if it is not written in the Treaty. We need to move forward in that area. We cannot afford to wait 10 years, to wait until we have amended the Treaty. We must adopt rules of procedure if the Treaty cannot be implemented quickly. I think that we are in the process of proving that in the difficult moments of managing a crisis, we can make progress without respecting the Treaty to the letter. And that was a little painful for us in the European Parliament. We felt to some extent that we had been forgotten. However I do think, Mr Barroso, and you said so this morning, that you are applying what we voted for here. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, once again, our Parliament is being asked to debate the decisions that we expect to be taken by a European Council and, once again, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is calling for a European response – an EU response – to the crisis. Once again, a resolution will be adopted, tomorrow, by an overwhelming majority of MEPs, calling on the Heads of State or Government to show a sense of responsibility when they meet on 23 October. Like most of my colleagues who are present, I sometimes feel as though I am repeating myself and taking part in a discussion between the institutions and our Member States in which everyone is talking at cross purposes. Yes, we agree on the significance of the crisis, on the urgent need to come up with solutions, and on the vital mix of deficit reduction measures and measures to boost growth and employment, but we differ as to the measures that need to be taken and whether those measures should be taken piecemeal or with surgical precision. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must stop debating the ways in which it could possibly take its decisions and whether or not it should embark upon yet another reform of the Treaties. Europe must stop analysing, weighing things up and, above all, hesitating. Europe must act; Europe must put a stop to the debate about solidarity with Greece. Of course it must show solidarity, and the decision taken by the Troika yesterday was just as responsible as the political point-scoring episode in the Slovak Parliament was irresponsible. Europe must stop questioning whether or not we should cut our public deficits. Of course we should tackle public deficits at national and regional level! It is just a question of knowing how to do so and of making sure that any action we take is completely fair from a fiscal and social point of view. President Barroso, I am not going to read the text that I prepared for the Commission. I am simply going to congratulate you and tell you that I agree with what you have said today and that I am behind it. The only thing I would add is that I wish you luck in getting it past the Council, and you will have the support of our political group. Go for it, do not be afraid. Measures need to be taken before Christmas. Thank you very much, then, for this presentation that you have delivered to us today. When I talk about Europe, I am not just talking about Brussels and Strasbourg. I am also talking about Bratislava, London, and all the European capitals. They must understand that real sovereignty is not just the gilded treasures found in republican or royal palaces. Real sovereignty, ladies and gentlemen, is the ability to give our fellow citizens the life they deserve, the standard of living they work for, and freedom. We will not achieve that by withdrawing behind our national borders, closing the Schengen borders again or bringing back protectionism. Growth and jobs – although I know that the anti-Europeans do not agree, and I love the fact that they are grumbling, because it means that we are on the right track (Applause)
. Mr Farage, you gave a good example of this at the last Conference of Presidents, and I hope that it will be the same today – growth and jobs, President-in-Office of the Council, will only materialise again in Europe if, as from 23 October, our Member States play the game, the European game, the solidarity game, the game of ‘all for one and one for all’ fully, unconditionally and quickly. Let me say it again, for the third time in my speeches: we need to bring into line tax rates, retirement age and weekly working time, to mention just a few examples. My group has not given me enough time to list everything that is impossible in Europe. However, you know that the word ‘impossible’ is not in the French vocabulary. Therefore, anything is possible, and that is also my party’s slogan. Europe must act, and I am convinced that it will succeed. President Barroso, we need a response for our fellow citizens. What kinds of questions are we having to answer today in our campaigns? When I listen to people who have worked hard all their lives, who have a savings book, I find that the question they ask is: ‘Are our savings and what we have struggled to acquire throughout our life protected by Europe and the euro?’ Yes, they are protected! Yes! Therefore, that is the response we must give them; that is the guarantee we must confirm to them. We have a duty, at Heads of State or Government level and in the European institutions, to give them that initial response. As far as everything else is concerned, you are right; we do have the tools, we do have the political means. If we implement them, we will overcome the crisis. Moreover, I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that European countries are not the only ones that are contacting our offices today. We are also being contacted by those who are already worried about whether we are going to succeed and whether the euro, at EUR 1.10 perhaps, is going to revive the European economy in relation to that of other continents, which are beginning to ask themselves questions. As you have said, then, let us take action together, ladies and gentlemen; let us not play cat and mouse, but let us be bold. I am convinced that we are now going to pave the way for our exit from the crisis, for Europe’s exit from the crisis, so that we can restore it to its place in the world in which we want to live. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 The answer is very simple, Ms Jaakonsaari. We have done the following: last weekend, four of my colleagues travelled to Greece to hold talks with our sister party, in order to move things forward, as you mentioned in your question. We are therefore working on this issue every day, and at the end of the week, three more people travelled to the country. We are working in close cooperation both with the party and with the Greek delegation, and we are also discussing this issue within our group. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr Barroso, it is heart-warming to hear such a speech. Like you, I may give an analysis, but after this speech, we will act together. Europe is going through a confidence crisis and a growth crisis. As if that was not enough, it is going through a leadership crisis. It is high time that Europe came up with a political answer to the crisis. A united and strong answer, which puts politics in its rightful place, that is to say in the driving seat; I am talking to the Council. Because, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about a currency – the euro – created 10 years ago. We truly believe that we are giving ourselves the means to secure its governance. We talk about countries which, for decades, have lived above their means, always more, without wondering whether or not the money spent actually created growth and jobs. We talk about a Europe born to prevent internal conflicts and to ensure its peoples’ prosperity, a Europe that, until now, has succeeded on all these fronts. But we also talk about a Europe that is misunderstood, even criticised, because its leaders have not been able to explain why the choice of Europe is the only choice for the future and why the answer to global challenges can only be a European one. All too often, one forgets that the European Union is one of the most advanced and developed regions. It is the world’s leading power in terms of trade. Our duty is above all to make sure that it remains in that position. What is the problem, then? And how can it be solved? The problem is that, even though economists agree on the reasons behind the financial and economic crisis, and on how to respond to it – namely a mix of rigour and incentives for creating wealth and employment – the political class has not had the courage to set about the task. The reforms proposed these last few months by the Member States of the Union and of the euro area, in particular, are along the right lines. However, they are clearly insufficient, late and poorly explained, or not explained at all. They stem from the intergovernmental method which – it is plain to see – paralyses Europe, as you rightly said. The national approach, ladies and gentlemen, must give way to the European approach. We do not want to discuss subsidiarity here, but the Community approach is the only one that will enable us to meet in a united and effective way the urgent and huge challenges that are before us. I can understand that, in times of crisis, one feels the need to turn in on oneself. No, we must reach out and seek the Community approach. The European method is not two, three or four Presidents bringing different messages, but a single and swift exit strategy. Mr Barroso, you are the head of the executive for economic governance. You demonstrated it this morning in your speech. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) urges you to fully play your double role of proposing and implementing European legislation decided with the Council and Parliament. The Commission has a crucial role to play: that of guarantor of the European general interest. This is difficult and demanding, but necessary: we must resist national interests which are not always compatible with the common interest. (Applause)
 This is essential. That is why this Parliament placed its trust in you at the beginning of the mandate and continues to do so. Mr Barroso, I ask you to go even further in your ambitions, because there is urgency. There is urgency to save the euro, to demonstrate our solidarity towards Greece and towards all the member countries that are seeing their markets attacked and their rating downgraded. At the same time, it is urgent that these same countries adopt and implement measures that are a match for the events, for European solidarity comes at that price. We must act urgently, not in the months, but in the days and weeks to come, to prove to the world that Europeans are able to defend and stabilise their currency. If they do not do it, the whole European project will suffer in the long term. The decision that – I hope – this Parliament will take today on economic governance, the famous ‘six pack’, is an important step in the right direction. We now have to apply it as soon as possible, and the same goes for the decisions of 21 July on the stability funds. Mr Barroso, entrepreneurs need visibility and security. The markets expect the euro area and the countries of the Union as a whole to take strong and consistent measures for reducing expenditure but also for supporting growth. On the first aspect – that of streamlining public expenditure – a few days ago I called for a ‘big bang’, a common decision of the 17 on fiscal, budgetary and social convergence. I reiterate this call today. It is very difficult for one country in isolation to take the strong measures that the euro area’s financial situation requires. However, we must recognise that the election campaigns that are coming up in several European countries in the next few years will undoubtedly not be conducive to courageous measures. Therefore, I ask the Commission to seize the proposal to bring into line tax rates, particularly for businesses, but also retirement age and weekly working time. Europeans will only stand shoulder to shoulder with each other if they see the same rules applied. That is when we can feel European. (Applause)
 I am convinced that strong and swift decisions by the 17 on this triple convergence would have considerable impact and would be a tangible sign of leadership on Europe’s part. Ladies and gentlemen, I said this earlier on: the current crisis is as much a crisis of confidence, which calls for collective decisions like those I have just described, as it is a growth crisis. And without growth, Europe will be unable to reimburse even the interest on its debt. Without growth, Europe will not be able to develop or survive competition from emerging countries. This growth requires increased competitiveness, more resources allocated to education and training, as well as increased efforts in research, development and innovation. I call for a new public-private partnership with a view to creating centres of excellence in research and innovation and to creating – why not? – an Erasmus programme for first jobs, following the success of the Erasmus university scheme. I would like to see the European political policy-makers listening more to entrepreneurs and to social partners, since they are the ones who live with the reality of globalisation and who can help us emerge from the crisis. Ladies and gentlement, achieving growth also requires that we pay special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must not ride roughshod over them. They are the ones who bring us jobs and who help us to overcome the crisis. Yet they are asked to bear administrative, fiscal and social costs that are too high. If we want them to be able to expand and hire people, this growth will require greater flexibility for investing as well as for keeping and creating jobs. Ladies and gentlemen, the single market was the great idea of the 1980s. With the single market, Europe has won growth points and our manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale by gaining access to a continental market instead of a national one. Nonetheless, we all know that the European single market is far from being completed, especially in the services sector. I am asking the European Commission to get down to the task with as much ambition and determination as it showed 20 years ago. That is where growth is. Ladies and gentlemen, growth cannot be decreed. It is achieved by a whole series of structural measures, the ones precisely that we have already adopted in the Europe 2020 strategy. We now need to roll up our sleeves and above all apply these measures. It is time for Europe to speak strongly and intelligibly, not only to counter populism, which is the enemy of the European people, but to propose long-term solutions that our citizens understand and expect. It is time that our elected national representatives accept that voluntarily shared sovereignty is the only future for our countries, and I mean the only one. I am asking you, Mr Barroso, to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council a plan to get us out of the crisis. A plan that can be, for the 500 million Europeans, the chance for a fresh start, the chance to overhaul their project. We need bold actions and proposals, understood – I repeat – by our fellow citizens. Europe has always made progress in crises, but we still have to make the right proposals and believe in them. I always say that, before the crisis and after the crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. Things will be different. Mr Barroso, we must propose this change to our fellow citizens so that once again they believe in politics and in Europe. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Juncker, for weeks and months now, the leaders of the euro area have shown how determined they are to stand up for the euro and to make European solidarity the cornerstone for their political actions. Yet we need to recognise that what has been decided since the summer is not enough, is too late and, above all, difficult to implement. You get the feeling that it is the markets rather than politics now in the driving seat. That cannot last. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that only strong and simultaneous EU decisions will have the necessary weight to reassure our fellow citizens and the markets of our decision-making ability. Mr Juncker, intergovernmental management of the crisis has reached the end of the road. As both a head of government and President of the Eurogroup, can you tell us then what the plans are to get us out of the crisis? The worst thing is that we cannot see a way out. There are a number of instruments: Eurobonds, guarantees from AAA countries, quadrupling the stability fund’s firepower, but over and above these instruments, where is the political will and how do we bring it all together? We need to be strong and, above all, we need to lead the way in getting out of the crisis. So where are you? (Applause
) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the European Union has been seeking sustainable solutions; however, faced with the attacks on the euro, initiatives have been taken. I am referring here to the first public finance consolidation measures and to the positive golden rule proposal. I am also referring to the introduction of measures to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility and the establishment of new economic governance instruments, or the six-pack, on which I should like to see a definitive agreement reached before the end of the month. I am also referring to the coordination of national budgets and to this summer’s proposals regarding European economic governance, the financial transactions tax and tax harmonisation. (The speaker broke off due to an interpreting problem)
 Mr President, since the start of the crisis, billions of euros have been committed. European citizens are indeed concerned, as they can see no end to the efforts being asked of them. They feel as if they are feeding a bottomless pit, even though they are aware that this European crisis calls for a Europe-wide response and not only a national one. They question the ability of national and European leaders to end this crisis of confidence and growth once and for all. The markets remain unsatisfied, doubtful and particularly volatile, and react to the slightest rumour. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come, for eurozone Member States and for any other EU Member States that would like to be involved, to pull out all the stops and adopt strong measures, together and at the same time, to put an end to the doubts over the EU’s capacity to shoulder its responsibilities. President Barroso, President-in-Office of the Council, Europe must restore its credibility. Europe must face up to reality and regain control of public finances. It must prepare itself for a transitional period characterised by stringent financial management at both national and regional level, and by incentives for savers and for investment in innovation, education and training. Europe must undergo a dramatic transformation to be referred to as the federation of the United States of Europe, or simply integration. In this crisis, as in any other crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. The question is: are we capable, right now, of envisaging a different future for ourselves? I recommend that, on the basis of a Commission proposal, all eurozone governments and all other EU governments who so wish, take a decision to drastically reduce their debts by taking coordinated measures, all at once and on the same day, to ensure the viability of their pension systems and to actually harmonise their taxation, in particular their corporate taxation. By suddenly making economic governance a reality, and one that is accepted by all the Member States of the euro area, the EU would achieve two things: it would demonstrate its capacity to take long-term action, and it would strengthen cohesion between citizens, who would at last be subject to the same rights and obligations. By taking coordinated budgetary discipline measures while stimulating crucial growth in our economies, countries would establish a single or converging set of rules and would send a clear and strong message as to their will to further integration. I should like to say a word, President Barroso, about growth. We are constantly saying ‘growth, growth’. Many people still dream of achieving double-digit growth. Our primary duty is to sustain low growth and avoid deflation. The European institutions, for their part, must be more ambitious as regards common policies. We need those policies that we refer to regularly: a trade policy, an ambitious research policy, a food-safety policy, an industrial policy that has finally undergone reform, and above all a policy enabling the internal market to function properly. We have many regulations, but in these difficult times it remains to be seen whether they are actually applied. If there are things which need revising, we will revise them, but there is no need to add to them in the current climate. Let us also enhance integration of the euro area, the heart of European integration, in order to help reform the European Union. That is what we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for, as we are aware of the responsibility of the centre-right, which is in the driving seat in times of trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, our credibility is going to be at stake over the coming months. It is true that we are under very heavy attack, which is probably exaggerated in some areas. It is now up to us to show that the EU has the capacity to restore growth conditions and avoid succumbing to deflation. This, too, will safeguard employment levels. Everything must be done to protect our way of life as much as possible and to defend our values. A major integration effort is ultimately not the way to succeed. Instead, ladies and gentlemen, we must find a way, among responsible democratic political groups, of showing a new approach and a new path to our Heads of State or Government, who are in a very difficult situation. What I am asking of this Parliament, and of President Barroso and the President-in-Office of the Council, over the coming weeks, is unity, that is to say a single vision for European citizens for the four or five years to come. That is what we must work towards today. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, I will give a very brief answer to that. If agricultural support in Poland is harmonised, taxation will also be harmonised to a certain extent. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, by way of an introduction, allow me to say, Mr President-in-Office, that if, during these six months, you apply the European method you have described this morning – as I do not doubt you will – we will be considering ways to extend the Polish Presidency of Europe. (Applause)
 European integration will be at the heart of the priorities of the new Presidency of the Council, to the great satisfaction of our group. This integration, and especially this Community method, must feature in all the major debates over the coming months and years. I am thinking of the financial resources of Europe. It is a significant issue that we will discuss together for the 2014-2020 period. I am also thinking of the internal market. Mr Tusk, you are concerned about the rise of Euroscepticism in several countries. I share this concern, as does my group. Euroscepticism and isolationism are symptoms of a cancer in our society. Your response to this ‘every man for himself’ attitude is a call for integration, which echoes the watchword of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is not the problem, but ‘more Europe’ is the solution. Your Presidency will be dominated by the necessary consolidation of public finances in the Member States, the stabilisation of the euro and the opening of the debate on the financial framework. The euro can only be stabilised if the countries experiencing difficulties really implement the necessary reforms in order to reform public finances and to create the conditions to enable a return to sustainable growth. Half-hearted measures will not solve the underlying problems. If I take the case of Poland, which is growing by nearly 4% and, with an uncommon level of efficiency, has known how to best use EU funds since it became a member, I see that European solidarity, combined with political will, can lead to the construction of a real, solid economy. Mr Tusk, you are one of the few Heads of State or Government in Europe to agree to debate with the national parliaments, with this Parliament and with other European institutions about the issue of the resources needed for Europe to operate. You are, moreover, the only one willing to discuss an issue that is important to a large majority in this Parliament, namely, the introduction of own resources to finance Europe’s role. Therefore, we will be by your side to deal with this issue seriously and we know that this task will be challenging. The Presidency of the Council believes that all our economic and social policies must be based on the Europe 2020 strategy, which all Member States have already accepted. It is right because the economic crisis will only be overcome in a sustainable manner if the Member States understand that all 27 States acting together is less expensive and much more productive than each one acting in isolation. Solidarity, ladies and gentlemen, is not just virtuous; it is also profitable. That goes for European finances as well as for the internal market and I am pleased that the Polish Presidency has established this issue and, in particular, electronic services, improved working conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the long-awaited creation of a European patent system, or indeed the Single Market Act, as its main concerns. Mr Tusk, just like the European Parliament, you have found the recent disagreements on the Schengen issue hard to bear. My group supports you in your desire to strengthen our resources and our joint effort on our external borders. In this regard, I call on the Commission and the Council to take a clear position on the unilateral decision made by Denmark to exempt itself from the rules on freedom of movement. My group would like to express its serious concerns. I would like to know what your position is, and that of the President of the Commission. (Applause)
 Mr Barroso, some commissioners will not be able to take holidays in July and August, since it will also be necessary, at this time, to closely monitor the Danish borders. I stated yesterday that perhaps we should think about introducing visas for Danes to be sent to Europe so they are better protected! Just as the European Parliament has done, you have identified the key challenges for Europe, which are food security and energy dependence. It will certainly not be possible to resolve all these issues in just six months. You will at least be able to take the credit for raising them and, as I told you when we met in Warsaw, it will be you who will lay the foundations, and I am certain that they will be solid foundations. I shall conclude by commending your determination in the management of relations with your neighbours. We have recently often discussed support for our southern neighbours, and firm policies on this issue should be developed. Relations with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, as well as with other countries like Ukraine and Belarus, in particular, are just as deserving of our attention and efforts. Mr Tusk, my group has great expectations of your political will and your leadership. I shall conclude by drawing inspiration from the words of a great Pole whom you know well, Pope John Paul II: ‘Do not be afraid, Mr Tusk: go ahead; we are with you’. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has shown how the rotating Presidency has continued to play an important role in our decision-making system. We have to recognise the importance of the advances that have been made in these last few months on a number of fronts. Firstly, there are the advances on the economic front, with the progress that has been made on governance and the success of the first-ever European Semester. Secondly, there is the common policy front, with the measures taken concerning social cohesion, the common agricultural policy, food security, the single market, the Danube strategy and, of course, energy policy. Thirdly, there is the external front, with the accession of Croatia, but also the expression of our solidarity with our Japanese friends and with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Let me inform you, Mr Orbán, of the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on most of these points. First, I want to thank the Hungarian Presidency. In particular I would thank the Minister of State for EU Affairs, our former fellow Member Mrs Győri, for the enormous efforts she has made towards taking the governance package forward and, in particular, granting Parliament’s requests for the Community method to be applied. We have been successful on 90% to 95% of our requests. I am very disappointed that, because of the stance some people have taken, we cannot reach a conclusion this week as planned. Without economic governance, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no stability for the euro. Without a stable euro, the chances of Europe winning the battle for growth, and thus the battle for employment and social cohesion, are next to nothing. The PPE Group is convinced of this. President of the Council, I also want to emphasise the progress that has been made on common policies since January. There has been progress on the cohesion policy, with the agreement reached in February on the strengthening of this device in the coming years. There has also been progress on the common agricultural policy, with the agreement reached in March on the broad outlines of the reform, against a background of worrying increases in the prices of raw materials as well as ever greater challenges in relation to food security. Thirdly, there has been progress on energy and innovation, strategic themes to which an entire meeting of the European Council was devoted at the start of February, one month before the Fukushima tragedy. Finally, there has been progress on the single market, which will be consolidated further thanks to the Single Market Act. On all these major topics, the Hungarian Presidency has made progress in spite of a difficult political and economic environment. I would add one important element to that, namely the policy on the Roma, on which you, Mr Orbán, have been able to conciliate the Europeans and propose specific actions. I am particularly grateful to you for that. I will end by mentioning the advances made in the area of external affairs. I have already had the opportunity to welcome the progress made by Croatia during the last few months; it is only because of this that the 27 were able to give it the green light for its accession in accordance with the timetable that President Orbán wished for, starting in January. This accession is good news for the Croatian people. It is also good news for the peoples of the Balkans, who must be able to rely on a concrete European perspective. The events that have occurred in the Mediterranean, too, have dominated the Presidency to a great extent. Europe has managed to give a clear demonstration of moral solidarity, but has also shown real solidarity with its southern neighbours, and it has also managed to resolve the problems that arose concerning the economic refugees who immigrated to the Italian coast. At the same time – and I am particularly happy about this – the Schengen area has been opened up to Romania and Bulgaria, not in order to do them a favour, but because they are respecting the rules that apply to everyone. This shows that European solidarity has to be earned and that effort is rewarded. I thank the Hungarian Presidency and wish all the best to the Polish Presidency. Joseph Daul,

Madam President, you know that I am always very brief. Martin, we are proper Democrats –
 you respect democracy and so do we. It is true that it is easier to win than to lose. We will continue the negotiations and at the beginning of July, we will take a final vote on the report after negotiation. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Győri, I would firstly like to say a brief word to you, in acknowledgement of all the work you have done and especially of the methodical approach you employed and the hours you devoted to this work, with Parliament in particular. I think that is worth mentioning and so, once again, thank you. (Applause)
 You are applauding her, but it could not have been any other way: we have trained her well within our group. Therefore, she knows what Parliament is all about. Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances. Seldom have expectations been so high among the people in our various countries, expectations of brave and united decisions from their leaders on the burning issue of the euro and the debt crisis, as well as on economic governance. In several countries, and especially in Greece, our fellow citizens are confused, anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children’s future. I would like to take this opportunity to send out three messages to our Greek friends. Firstly, Europe is in solidarity with them, and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility – and I stress the word responsibility. Secondly, the situation that they – and indeed many other countries in Europe – are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means. This has to be said, and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality. My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term. This will involve making sacrifices, but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end. This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country’s twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation. Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking – that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) – or, after having expressed their concern, they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy. My group, ladies and gentlemen, is calling for a shake-up. It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial. We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves – and when I say ‘us’, I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens. This brings me back to the European Council, from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity. However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily, as they have done in the past. When the Council, with Parliament, decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States, it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity. We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with. If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past. I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that. I will conclude on a positive note, by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th Member State in a few months’ time. This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government, whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend. This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans, who are doubting themselves right now. However, the values that Europe embodies – solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity – have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else. I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro and public debt crisis demand solutions at European and not national level. This is the message that Mr Barroso, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, has been sending the Member States for months. However, a European solution means European funding. My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe, both in its objectives and its terms of reference. My question to the Council is as follows: is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s? Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable? I think not. It is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers. It has changed, and it would be irresponsible not to reflect these changes in the ways in which Europe is funded, in other words, in the way Europe is designed. (The speaker broke off, hoping to continue his speech later) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe’s new realities, trends and aims. Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe’s place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed. It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes. The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate. When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources. We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets. This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets. Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits. Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States. Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year. Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts. So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances. Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments. Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt. Europeans need to be told the truth. The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum. The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish. The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen. The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage. Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe’s capacity for influencing the world. The European Parliament – and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me – is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework. If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever. If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects. Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe. Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes. As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions – some more peaceful than others – taking place in a number of neighbouring Mediterranean countries and, more recently, by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism, namely, the end of the Bin Laden era. What is Europe’s role in all of this? Are we willingly and actively involved in the situation? Yes, we certainly are. The action being taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government has demonstrated that, when it wants to, Europe – or some of Europe – can act decisively in difficult times. Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding ‘No’. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion. Europe backed stability and development aid in the Mediterranean. Yet the people are – quite legitimately – demanding political freedom and are fleeing their countries because there is no prospect of a life of dignity and opportunity for them and their children. The humanitarian assistance that we have provided over recent months has definitely been useful. Baroness Ashton, we need to do more. Have we begun to learn from these events? I would like to think so. What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea – and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths – are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement. (Applause)
 Is all of this worthy of Europe, of European values, principles and ideals? I do not think so, nor does my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) nor, I am sure, do the majority of Members in this House. Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon. We now need to move on and take action. That entails making choices and sticking to them. What, then, are Europe’s priorities? Relations with our eastern and southern neighbours? Combating terrorism? A solution to the conflict in the Middle East? Trade policy? Tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task. Who are our preferential partners? The United States, emerging countries, or others? How can we achieve the best results? By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice? Ladies and gentlemen, an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs, security and defence: instead, we need more Europe. We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level. Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives. Ladies and gentlemen, 2011 should be the year of the Mediterranean, of combating terrorism, even of achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East conflict. If Europe is capable of becoming a key player in this area, it will be able to put the errors of its youth behind it. Let me close with a quote from someone very familiar to you: John Paul II. ‘Do not be afraid,’ Baroness Ashton. We have made savings of EUR 4 billion in the European budget. Please come up with some proposals for using that money, rather than returning it to the Member States. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentleman, the last European Council has set our countries on the right track. By increasing the capacity of the Solidarity Fund and deciding to make it permanent, the 27 have once again demonstrated their commitment to the euro and the importance they place on solidarity between the more financially stable countries and those facing temporary difficulties. At the same time, the decision to seal a euro pact between eurozone countries, and further afield, is indicative of the political will of European leaders to draw lessons from the financial crisis. The fact that we share a currency forces us to be more coherent in our economic and social choices. The time when countries could set an atypical rate of taxation or specific social rules without first consulting their partners is long gone. The reason for this is simple: all countries should benefit from the solidarity of their eurozone partners. Yet our people will only accept this solidarity if they think that everyone is putting the same effort into managing public funds. In this respect, the euro pact is a major step forwards towards the convergence of our economies. My group strongly supports it, but demands – and I shall continue to demand – that it is implemented in the context of the Community method, under the auspices of the Commission, Mr President. You are taking the right steps, you have done some good work, but more needs to be done within this Community method under the auspices of the Commission. That is how we will build Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, you know how stubborn I can be and I will repeat it as many times as necessary here so that no one forgets. Europe sets itself apart from the rest of the world with its model of the social market economy, a model which our fellow citizens are quite rightly proud of and which is based on the principle of solidarity, but one which is difficult to preserve in the face of globalisation. The question is knowing how to ensure its future is sustainable by striking a happy medium between the nanny state favoured by socialists, which we have seen almost bankrupt us, and that of excessive liberalism, the dangers of which we have seen with the financial crisis. Three things are needed to achieve this. Firstly, all our countries need to reduce their deficit; secondly, they need to adopt comparable budgetary, fiscal and social rules; and, thirdly, they need to invest together in innovation to boost growth, which to date is clearly inadequate. Indeed, we can only preserve and strengthen our model if we invest in growth sectors: green energy, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, and so on. Given our limited financial room for manoeuvre, the best way to meet the growth challenge and achieve economies of scale is to pool our skills as well as our capital. Without massive investment in innovation, without a genuine European plan, we are denying ourselves the ability to keep up with our competitors. Ladies and gentlemen, while our Heads of State or Government were meeting, 10 days ago, the Fukushima power station continued to be an issue of global concern and the insurgents in Libya were looking to Europe for strong action. On these two matters, our countries and the European Union have shown a great sense of responsibility. We have in fact offered Japan our nuclear expertise in what is an extremely difficult and worrying situation for that country, and also for the international community at large. There will no doubt be a pre-Fukushima and a post-Fukushima. Although unfortunately not there yet, my group wants the post-Fukushima to be a period of reflection and action, firstly to ensure that the rules governing nuclear safety are significantly tightened and, secondly, to further our efforts in the field of green energy. I agree with your approach to Côte d'Ivoire, Mr President. Turning lastly to the Mediterranean, I welcome the European Council’s repeated call for Colonel Gaddafi to relinquish power, allowing for a new page in this country’s history. What I want is for all our countries to come together and discuss a neighbourhood policy as ambitious and successful for the South as the one they were able to make in the 1990s for the East. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would simply like to tell Mr Cohn-Bendit that, in order to challenge a seat, an official proposal must firstly be made. If no proposal is made, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot analyse the situation. Before intervening in this way, I suggest that you think before you act. That is all. (Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit: ‘Yes, but he might not have a seat’)
 You are the one asking me to observe the law. I have always observed the law. Now let us leave it to the Committee on Legal Affairs to give its verdict. It cannot give its verdict without a proposal. If that proposal is not lawful, the Committee on Legal Affairs will tell us. Let me say again: let us think before we act. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is preparing to meet for the second week running amid a climate of international uncertainty and tensions. There is the uncertainty in Japan, where the level of human loss is still difficult to determine, and uncertainty in the Mediterranean, as further populations rise up against their regimes, in Bahrain and as you mentioned President-in-Office of the Council, in Yemen. Inevitably, all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe. Our fellow citizens have witnessed Japan’s drama unfolding live. On top of the empathy we feel for the thousands of families shattered by grief, as we speak there are fears associated with the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the dread of the dangers that we too could face in a similar or comparable situation. These events should certainly be taken on board by all countries that have nuclear power plants and it is good that this Parliament is organising a debate on nuclear safety, though we should not lose sight of the fact that in Europe we need to be increasing and not reducing our energy independence. This is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session. This weekend, the 27 Heads of State or Government will also be discussing the UN decision to intervene in Libya to save the insurgents from imminent attack by the regime. I would like to highlight the fact that European States have taken the initiative in these operations and were the first to intervene within the framework of the UN mandate, which itself was the initiative of several European States. No doubt they heard what us MEPs said during our last part-session here in Brussels. My group would like to see the Council take this opportunity to further develop the EU’s Mediterranean strategy, whilst maintaining the goal to help and support but never to impose. This is our duty as neighbours. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following last week’s euro area summit, at which the groundwork was done, the Council’s flagship measures this week will relate to strengthening the euro and making progress on economic governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of increasing the funds available to support the euro and of making the ad hoc instrument we adopted last year to help Greece and Ireland more permanent. This political will reflects the responsible attitude that Member States have taken in managing this unprecedented crisis in our single currency’s history. However, we wish to stress very strongly that these exceptional circumstances that the loss of control of national public finances has brought about must not be seen by the Council as an opportunity to adopt a different method for managing European affairs. The Community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception. A very strong majority within Parliament supports this principle and the Barroso Commission also supports us in this approach, quite simply because it is vital for the future of the European Union. I am sure that President Van Rompuy will succeed in persuading the Heads of State or Government of this. The Pact for the euro should also be adopted on Friday. We welcome it insofar as it introduces provisions for which we have been calling for months now, namely convergence between Member States’ budgetary, social and fiscal policies. I cannot stress this enough: European solidarity will only be accepted by our citizens if they feel it is fair and deserved. This will only be the case if the working conditions are met and if our businesses can invest and recruit under comparable fiscal conditions. Lastly, our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament’s position as co-legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion. Europe must get back on the path of growth and employment, and the measures that are taking shape are a step in this direction. Provided they are planned within a Community framework, they will give Europe a healthy basis for a fresh start and a promising future. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal. Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments – all the amendments – requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members. Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts. The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament. My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world? Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law? (Applause)
 In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes? The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality. Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores? (Applause)
 Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same. The credibility of Parliament is at stake. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what lessons have we learnt from the financial crisis? The lesson we learnt from the Second World War was that our nations should work together and stop tearing each other apart. From the fall of the Berlin Wall, we learnt lessons about authoritarian and communist regimes and we were able to reunite our continent around the values of freedom, democracy and the social market economy. From the terrorist attack of 11 September, we learnt that we had to strike a new balance between security and freedom. From this financial crisis, the lesson we must learn is for our Member States to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary, fiscal and social fields. I know exactly how far we have come. The establishment, this year, of cooperation between the 27 on their budgetary priorities constitutes, in itself, a major shift in attitude. The regulations that we have provided ourselves with to make the financial markets more ethical are, also, exemplary, but they do not suffice. My group would like to call for an agreement to be reached between Parliament and the Council, before the summer, on strengthened economic governance. My group would also like to call for efforts to be pursued on the coordination of social and fiscal matters. That is the thrust of the competitiveness pact, the initial version of which has already been revised to be in greater accordance with Community values. However, we must go even further still and ensure that both Parliament and the Commission exercise all the prerogatives that they enjoy in this respect, and in this, we are counting on the President of the Commission. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes and supports these proposals as did the national leaders of the party in Helsinki. Ladies and gentlemen, how can we explain to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as we are in a delicate financial situation in mid-July each year, most of our Member States should continue to spend as if nothing were amiss? How can it be that the over-indebtedness of our States is more acceptable, more tolerable and more bearable than that of households or businesses? I have witnessed this at company level. The crisis has led to job losses and family trauma; the least we can do is to learn lessons from this and tell things as they are. The first lesson is that we should no longer treat lightly the obligations placed on States – whatever their size – to respect budget limits. The second lesson is this: European solidarity can only operate if, and only if, our social and fiscal regulations are at least comparable. They do not necessarily need to be identical – just comparable. At the moment, this is far from being the case. The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy. The fourth and final lesson is that even in a storm, Europe is standing firm and European integration is becoming stronger. Our American and Japanese partners have debt ratios far in excess of ours, without, it must be said, being excessively worried by it. However, that will probably not always be the case. For our part, now is the time to consolidate our economy and our competitiveness. Now is the time to work on creating jobs for the future. Now is the time to tell things as they are. Let us not miss this opportunity! Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there is something that I do not understand. Last week, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we would be holding a debate on Russia in March because Baroness Ashton would be present. Secondly, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we needed to organise a debate on Russia because Mr Putin was going to visit the Commission, or rather Mr Barroso. According to the information I have received this afternoon, Mr Putin is not coming to see the Commission. Do you have any information on this issue? The debate was requested last week only because Mr Putin was coming. However, a debate on Russia, together with a resolution, is still scheduled for March. I should now like to receive some information concerning what we discussed. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what will the European public take away from the meeting of its leaders this Friday in Brussels? Will it understand that European responses to European challenges – the euro, energy, research and innovation and employment – are being sought in good faith? Or rather that, once again, we are surrendering to the sorry spectacle of division and power struggles? What headlines will the major newspapers run? What will people be talking about on Saturday in blogs and on Facebook when they refer to the European Council’s decisions? About the timidity of Europe when faced with the situation of Mediterranean countries which long to have their rights respected, or, on the contrary, about its leadership? Europe’s duty in this regard is quite clear: it must harness all its resources and all its diplomatic skills to aid the transition and the organisation of democratic and open elections. Ladies and gentlemen, as far as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the solution to our problems lies in having more Europe, not less. The solution does not lie in more so-called national victories, but in more common victories and more coordinated responses. The solution does not lie in a lax attitude towards applying our common rules, but in greater discipline. The solution, ladies and gentlemen, does not lie in greater divergences between our budgets, our labour laws and our taxation rates, but in greater convergence. As far as the PPE Group is concerned, there is but one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, which is that, without a common vision and without shared resources, our countries will sink into sluggish growth and plunge into social crisis. If there is just one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is that, by thinking, working and investing as Europeans, our countries will emerge from the difficult patch they are going through and will be forever stronger for it. What else will make us react as one if not the difficulties that we have just experienced? Together with the European Commission, the majority of my colleagues in this House and, I am sure, the majority of the 500 million Europeans, I put the following question to the European Council: when are we going to act and react more as one? As for the euro, I now know that that our governments will hold fast and will not allow speculators to destroy 60 years of European integration. I now call on them to concentrate on the consolidation of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, as this is essential. I call on them in particular to strengthen their budgetary discipline and to keep up their efforts to reduce public debt. European governance is the sine qua non
 of the success of our common project. My group supports it as much as it supports the euro, that is to say, totally. The solution to our problems, as I said at the beginning of my speech, is to have more Europe, not less. While this is true in the cases of employment and the economy, it is also true for energy, a topic which the Council will also cover on Friday. Having more Europe means, first and foremost, fully implementing the laws that already exist in relation to the internal energy market. It can never be emphasised enough that making this market fully operational will make us more competitive, will ensure the security of our supplies and will guarantee a substantial increase in renewable energy production. Having more Europe also means encouraging our States to meet the challenge of increasing their energy efficiency by 20% between now and 2020. They were the ones that set themselves this objective. We must ensure that they reach it, or else we shall have to raise the standards they have to meet to do so. Finally, having more Europe in the field of energy means investing more. The Commission estimates that it will cost EUR 1 billion to reach the required infrastructure level. We expect ambitious decisions from the European Council in order to achieve this. Europe needs secure, clean energy just as much as it needs a research and development policy and a policy for promoting industrial innovation. Here too, the solution lies in having more Europe and paying more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The solution lies in reducing bureaucracy to a minimum and finally reaching an agreement on a European patent. In the area of innovation, too, we expect common solutions from our leaders, not parochial squabbles. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to move on from our knee-jerk reactions of the past. Promoting our differences is all well and good, but making them mutually complementary is even better. Taking individual initiatives can be useful, but playing as a team is the way to win the match. Harbouring national ambitions is perfectly legitimate, but understanding that the game is won at international level by playing as a team is the way to guarantee a future for the people of Europe.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the last European Council clearly showed that the euro is a vital pillar of European integration. Everything possible must be done to stabilise and strengthen it. Our Heads of State or Government have since confirmed their deep attachment to the European currency and the fact that Estonia is joining the euro area at the beginning of this year is yet another signal in this direction, as well as setting a very good example of how to respect standards to the major countries that fail to respect them. That said, no one underestimates the seriousness of what Europe is going through economically and socially within the euro area. Everything possible must be done in 2011 to overcome these problems and to reassure the markets, not superficially but structurally, in other words, by creating the right conditions for growth and employment in the long term. I think we are speaking the same language on this issue. Firstly, this means that national public finances must be restored to better health. Push hard for this, let us not give in! Secondly, it means that the Member States must get their fiscal policies to converge more closely, and also their taxation and social policies. It also means that we must come to a swift agreement on the euro area bail-out fund and that this fund only makes sense if it is backed up by strict enforcement of the fiscal discipline rules. Our citizens must know that the countries they are assisting in difficult circumstances are keeping a very strong check on their public accounts; otherwise, they will no longer agree to stump up, if I may put it that way. Finally, as I said, we must create the conditions for growth and employment. That also implies completing the European internal market, investing more in research and innovation, and in lifelong education and training. My group wants the EU approach to be promoted over the intergovernmental approach in all these areas, quite simply because it is far more effective and far more sustainable. Mr Van Rompuy, I call on you to ensure that reform of the Treaty, confirmed at the last European Council, be concluded as soon and as swiftly as possible. The budget debate is only just beginning. My group will continue to call for a thorough review of European public finances in forthcoming years, with the aim of once again creating the conditions for growth and employment in Europe. Mr Barroso, let us scrutinise everything, let us not be afraid and, as I have already said several times, let us take two or three different examples of budgets: for example, how can we pull Europe out of its current situation with 1%, 2% or 5%? We will not succeed by reducing resources. If we want to create jobs, we need more European resources, and this does not mean that the Member States have to spend more money. Let us not be afraid, President van Rompuy and President Barroso. Put these proposals to us and we, the Heads of State or Government, as well as Parliament, will be forced to find the right solution – but at least let us have a number of options from which to choose. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, rarely will the Presidency of the Council of Ministers have had to face so many challenges: the challenge of the euro, which we must stabilise, the challenge of employment, which is experiencing stronger growth and therefore a more efficient economy, the challenge of energy independence and food security, while prices for raw materials are rising alarmingly. I have no doubt that the Hungarian Presidency will be able to deal with these challenges, alongside the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Mr Orbán, you have won the confidence of your electorate in Hungary. Your party, Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége (FIDESZ), is based on an idea, on an ideal, on a value: that of liberty and democracy. Since your election, you have, with the Hungarian Parliament, undertaken a whole series of reforms which your people have called for by democratically giving you a large majority. Today, one of those reforms – the one concerning the media – is the subject of legal scrutiny by the European Commission, guardian of the Treaties. You yourself stated last week – and I thank you for doing so – during your talks with Mr Barroso, and since then, that were this law incompatible with European law, you would submit it to your parliament for the necessary changes. I have complete faith in your word. For my part, I, like you, have confidence in the European Commission, which plays its role as guardian of the Treaties, and I also have confidence that you will respect the letter and the spirit of the European rules. Prime Minister Orbán, we have known each other for a long time and I consider you a very great European. For my part, I have no reason to doubt that you will do what you have said with regard to the media law and to the other priorities faced by your Presidency. I now come to those priorities, beginning with the first: the stability of Europe. Perhaps it is a good thing that the two presidencies of the Council that will follow one another in 2011 will be assumed by countries that do not belong to the euro area but which wish to join it in the very near future. Indeed, both Hungary and Poland are both entitled to join it. They therefore have a stake in ensuring the stability of this currency. I repeat: the only effective way of ending the speculative attacks against the euro and of strengthening the fundamentals of the European economy is to restore order to our public finances. This involves stronger coordination of fiscal and social policies in our countries, as is quite rightly provided for by the new budgetary period for the European Semester. It also depends on greater flexibility in our employment market and greater productivity. Like the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) firmly believes that the future of 500 million Europeans depends on a stronger, more united and more coherent Europe. It depends on having more of a Europe and certainly not less of a Europe. Mr Orbán, we need European economic governance. We need more communitarianism and I am sure that you will work towards this. President-in-Office of the Council, you have defined the setting up of a common energy policy as one of your main priorities. I think you are right. Mr Buzek, our President, has also, quite rightly, made it one of the strengths of his Presidency. I agree with you on this point, but I also want to warn you about the terribly worrying consequences that may result from the increase in the prices of all kinds of raw materials which has been particularly sharp over the last few months. We have already seen the social implications in several Mediterranean countries of such a price rise in basic foodstuffs, especially for the poorest countries. I hope that Europe will take this problem seriously and deal forcefully with speculators. I also hope that the Hungarian Presidency – I thought that the Group of the Greens were going to be silent, but I can hear them talking; it is not right, people should be quiet all the way through – will back the Commission in its assistance to Tunisia, which is going through a crucial time and must be supported as it moves towards change. Mr Orbán, you know that to succeed in your mandate and help Europe through its current difficult phase, you need the confidence of Parliament. In December, when we were in a difficult position with regard to the Council, you had the courage to sign the first-rate letters for us which really helped Parliament to approve its budget. Thank you, already, for what you did in December! Even before January, you included the political groups when defining your priorities, and naturally chose Mrs Győri, one of our very fine former colleagues, as Minister for EU Affairs. These are all positive signs which, I have no doubt, will be accompanied by a perfect balance between the reforms you are undertaking and the European values that every one of us here defends.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council, which opens this week, is taking place in a particular context: speculative attacks against the euro, the revival of euroscepticism and the beginning of reflections on Europe’s finances, while this Parliament is preparing to vote on the 2011 budget. These are, of course, closely linked. The euro crisis and the solidarity measures have an impact on the purchasing power of the European people, who are wondering if all these efforts are worthwhile, if they are leading to anything, whence the euroscepticism even in countries hitherto traditionally pro-European. This is a phenomenon hijacked by populist and extremist political factions, which feed on fear and the temptation to withdraw into oneself and which, when they are in government, do not have a miracle cure. I will start with the euro, which we must protect and strengthen while, at the same time, asking ourselves some fundamental questions. My first question is this: has Europe ever had a currency as stable as the euro? I say this to those nostalgic for national currencies: a step back would have catastrophic consequences for Europe. My second question is: who is behind the attacks to which the euro has been subjected for months? Who is standing to gain from the crime, if I may call it that? I am not a conspiracy theorist but, in my conversations with political leaders and financial analysts, the paths are converging on the source of our problems. When will we learn? I think we can talk directly to our friends. My third question is this: why is the euro still trading above USD 1.30? This is seriously hampering our exports and everyone is saying that the euro has had it. Why are our countries the only ones to practise a strict policy of orthodoxy while our competitors profit from their weak currencies to boost their economies? This is what our citizens are asking us. These are questions I have been asked in the last two weeks in meetings with elected politicians. Ladies and gentlemen, what we need is a message of confidence that we will overcome the crisis, measures to encourage a return to growth and concrete measures like those taken recently by the Barroso Commission to relaunch the internal market or to make the financial markets more ethical. What we need, and the euro crisis proved this, is convergence in our social and fiscal policies. That takes courage. President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, go further and faster and we will solve quite a few problems. We are going to need a lot of courage in the years to come if we want to strengthen our countries in the arena of global competition and if we want to use taxpayers’ money in the most effective way possible. This effort to streamline expenditure must be made at all levels: local, regional, national and European. The political and financial priorities of the Union need to be reexamined and the public finances of Europe need to be fundamentally reviewed. We need to ask ourselves the real questions and, depending on the answers we give, adapt our budgetary framework for the period 2014-2020. It is for this crucial debate that the European Parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that, as the representatives directly elected by 500 million Europeans, we intend to fully participate, even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right. I ask the European Council to give us its agreement and, if necessary, to vote, so that those who deny us this opportunity to participate in the debate assume their responsibilities. It is not, for us, about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction. We must lance the boil, we must take the right decisions, the necessary decisions to ensure that the European budget increasingly becomes an investment budget. If our Member States, mindful of budgetary constraints, can invest less in education, training, research and innovation, let us do so at European level by combining our resources and, therefore, by achieving economies of scale. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the debate on Europe’s finances must not be allowed to descend into a quarrel between Member States who want their money back. On the contrary, the debate should be about reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe by exposing them to the added value that concerted and visionary European action can represent. I am currently visiting the capital cities and I can tell you that the debate is taking hold. Do not miss this opportunity. Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end, I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament, as well as José Manuel Barroso, who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June. I believe that we must continue, together, in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us. We have to show them the way. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an opinion poll I read yesterday in a newspaper states that 70% of French people believe that they are still in the midst of a crisis and that it has not yet been resolved. I am sure that a broader survey in Europe would generate the same results. We must therefore address our citizens’ valid concerns. They are living in difficult times and cannot tolerate the slow and complex decision-making process at European and global level. Many of these people have also asked me what we are doing and what Europe is doing for them and their family. People are scared. At the same time, I see that more and more politicians and more and more countries, even in this House, are using, manipulating and exploiting this fear and this anxiety and do not have any proposals. This populist approach, which is corrupting our policy, is serious, and I should like to mention here that this is not the way to resolve the real and serious problems facing our countries and Europe in the world. I believe that it is up to the political parties and the parliamentary groups that are against such populism and demagogy to speak out more. No, the answer to the crisis is not to shy away from it or resort to protectionism. No, there is no fast or easy solution to the crisis we are facing. No, it is not possible to turn our back on solidarity or on efforts to strengthen all our countries in the face of globalisation and then realise, in the end, that we need partners when times are tough. We must learn some lessons from what is happening in Ireland, and this is not a criticism of Ireland, President of the Council, President of the Commission. We must learn lessons, because the difficulties that that country is facing are due not only to the banks but also to the current government’s fiscal and economic policy over the years. The Celtic Tiger, which was solely responsible for its own growth, with an atypical tax system, minimal banking regulation and an investment code unlike that of any other country in the European Union, is today witnessing a collapse of its property bubble, household debt, record unemployment and a crippled banking sector. The Irish Government has guaranteed the whole banking system, committing EUR 480 billion, or three times its GDP, which increases its public deficit to 32%. Today, the Irish Government has called for and rightly obtained European solidarity. I welcome this and, as Commissioner Rehn said in this very Parliament on Monday, the aid Ireland should soon receive will safeguard the stability of the whole euro area. Yet has this European solidarity, which Dublin is rightly receiving today, as it did when it joined the EU, been shown over the years by the Irish Government itself? How many times have Member States tried to align taxation – a prerequisite, as is all too evident today, for good governance of the euro? And every time the same few countries oppose it. I am not pointing the finger at anyone, but I believe that it is time for us to learn from such behaviour for the future. As I have said several times in this House, a crisis signifies an opportunity for change, and we must not be afraid to change some of our customs, which have not had the positive effect we were counting on. Ladies and gentlemen, the measures adopted by the European Council a few weeks ago and the guidelines agreed at the G20 in Seoul represent a step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. In other words, there needs to be an awareness of the need for cooperation in Europe and among major regional blocs in order to address the instability of financial markets and trade imbalances and also to avoid a currency war. We all know that, on all these issues, our countries alone will be unable to find a viable long-term solution to meet the expectations of the 500 million Europeans, who, as I said at the beginning, are expecting their politicians – that is to say all of us here and back home in our capitals – to make forward-looking decisions. President of the Council, if the crisis has taught us anything, it is that yesterday’s solutions are not necessarily those of tomorrow. We are paying a high price realising this in a time of crisis, but we will pay an even higher price if we continue to ignore it. I call on the European institutions and the governments of our Member States to change, to learn political lessons from the crisis, and to stop seeking solidarity only when it is too late. Mr President, I would like to add one last thing. This is not a question of the Council and Parliament fighting against one another; it is a question of implementing the treaties, of showing solidarity, and of working hand in hand. This is the message I should like to get across to you so that we might overcome the crisis for the sake of our fellow citizens. Joseph Daul  (PPE

I ask you to do so out of respect for democratic rights. Mr Gollnisch, you do not need to challenge me. We know your methods. They are unacceptable, anti-democratic. That is all I have to say to you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last Conference of Presidents, we decided to put the Matera report on today’s agenda. No one asked for that report not to be put on the agenda. Therefore, the question asked by the President is as follows: faced with an individual such as this, are we going to be able to have frank discussions, as we have been used to having for five years? That is the question I am going to ask on Thursday morning. Moreover, if the European Conservatives and Reformists continue to make this person participate in the Conference of Presidents, we are going to change the way we work. That is all I have to say. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR) 
Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the budget comes at a time when our fellow citizens are having doubts because of the weakness of their currency and when Europe is rightly rallying in support of the Irish economy. Contrary to what may have been said about the European Parliament’s objectives in these negotiations, this is not about power struggles or institutional disputes, nor is it about ignoring the difficulties faced by our Member States or the public debt crisis from which we are all suffering. No, it is about ensuring that Europe can honour its commitments. Commitments in the social sphere, and here I am thinking of education and lifelong learning; commitments to the victims of natural disasters, and here I am thinking of assistance for countries affected by food riots; and commitments to programmes that create jobs and growth, such as Galileo and ITER. The reality is that, by looking at things from an accounting point of view rather than from a political point of view, the few Member States that continue to block the negotiations are harming the interests of the 500 million Europeans. By making the European Parliament out to be the villain of the piece, and by suggesting that it wants to spend at a time when the Member States are tightening their belts, that it wants to exercise the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon to the detriment of saving and of Europeans, they are diverting attention from the reality of the problems that exist. What is that reality? It is that the latest economic forecasts offer no hope of a return, by 2020, to the strong, sustainable and inclusive growth that the European Union set itself as an objective. It is also a fact that the current draft budget makes no provision for the financing of the new powers conferred on the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon and fails to fulfil our requests to proceed with the mid-term review of the financial cycle laid down in the 2007-2013 agreement. Lastly, it is a fact that the draft budget makes no – and I mean no – financial provision for the 2020 strategy. In short, the Council is adopting programmes without making any financial provision for them. Moreover, when the President of the European Parliament reminds it of its obligations, it takes offence, but when a local, regional or national authority approves projects without financing them, that authority is condemned. Why, I ask you, would something that is unacceptable at local or national level be acceptable at European level? Is this a way of reconciling our citizens with Europe? I do not think so. I say clearly to the Commission and, above all, to the Council: do not count on my group, do not count on this House voting for programmes that do not have guaranteed funding. My group wants a return to common sense and a balanced agreement to be reached. It must be a comprehensive agreement that relates, at the same time, to the 2011 budget, the 2010 amending budget and its associated letters of amendment, the flexibility procedure and, finally, the guarantees regarding the financing of future policies, which we call the political section. I would stress that our proposals on this political section do not involve any changes to the current treaties, nor do they anticipate in any way the amount, origin or distribution of future EU funds. I would also stress that reopening the debate on own resources is not a new proposal by Parliament, but a decision taken by the Council itself in May 2006, following the agreement reached in December 2005 under the UK Presidency. My group fully supports the objective not only of capping but also of reducing the Member States’ budget contributions. Indeed, the extremely serious nature of the debt crisis must lead to a complete overhaul of European public finances. This is not just about dividing up tasks between national budgets and European budgets; it is also about seeking out all possible forms of mutualisation in order to make savings. Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the two demands made by the Council on 15 October: for the EU budget to contribute to common financial discipline and for the funding of European objectives to be guaranteed. That is all we are aiming for in the negotiations on the 2011 budget, and we are confident that an agreement can be reached if the Council Presidency negotiates effectively with its colleagues in Brussels. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common thread between the meetings of the European Council and the G20 is the need to make the necessary adaptations after the financial crisis. For the European Union, these adaptations consist of putting our respective national and EU public finances in order and protecting our currency, the euro, by consolidating it internally and defending its value against the other major currencies. The European Council will be dominated by discussions on Europe’s economic and financial governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the initial lines that the Van Rompuy task force has taken, including the plans for a system of sanctions against Member States that do not adhere to the criteria of the Stability Pact. However, there is still more work to be done, with more Community method and less intergovernmental method. I welcome the work that the Commission has done along these lines. I would ask the Council to remember that this Parliament is now colegislator and will play a full role in defining the forthcoming reforms. The more Parliament is brought on board in the early stages, the more chance we have of achieving a satisfactory and timely outcome. I call on President Van Rompuy to heed this message. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must make its voice heard in the debate on relative currency values, and the European Council must establish our position on the subject next week, before the Seoul G20 summit. Europe must join with its partners, in particular, the United States, in reminding the emerging countries of their responsibilities. Currency dumping and the social consequences it entails must no longer be allowed. Three major subjects will be on the table at the Seoul Summit: reform of the international monetary system of course, but also the stability of commodities – especially food and energy – and global governance. Europe has a message to deliver on each of these subjects, but this message will only be credible if we put in place effective internal, Community-wide instruments to govern and manage our public finances. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to influence global governance and will not really have a place on the international stage unless we can make the often unpopular effort to clean up our finances and unless we stick to our priorities of combating climate change and development policy. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget is the first budget that this Parliament is called on to negotiate and vote on using its new powers under the Treaty of Lisbon. It is the first in which we have desisted from calling for any increase in the global volume proposed by the Commission, instead preferring a realistic and political approach. A realistic approach insofar as our Member States have been called upon to make unprecedented efforts in stabilising and reducing their public finances. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the first to call upon them to do so. The reduction in public expenditure is, effectively, the prerequisite if our economies are to become more competitive and face up to international competition under favourable conditions. It is therefore not a question of our asking of the twenty-seven, for this budgetary year, expenditure which does not fit within the efforts made by our fellow citizens within their own national framework. However, our approach is also political insofar as we believe that the 2011 budget cannot be disassociated from the more general financial context of the years to come and, in particular, from the perspective of the next 2014-2020 financial cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, if there is an objective that our Parliament must aim for in the course of this legislature, it is to ensure that European policies are funded in a manner commensurate with what is at stake. It is not necessarily a question of asking for more money but rather to ensure that the tasks assigned to the European Union can be achieved with adequate funding. Our States can even economise, reduce their contribution to the Community budget, if they are prepared for Europe to change its financial system, as it is now obsolete, and take advantage of own resources. A euro spent at European level is, indeed, more profitable, more productive than a euro spent at national level, because a European euro does not have a deficit to cover. At national level, the euro is now worth only half or less in some countries. At national level too, this euro which has not already been reduced comes back in the shape of cohesion funds, funds for rural development and for promoting innovation. I request that the Council gives serious consideration to this new approach to European finance. I am grateful to Commissioner Lewandowski for already having opened this debate with our ministers of finance. Europeans have the right to know what their public authorities spend, whether these be local, regional, national or European. Member States must be ready to lift this gauntlet. President of the Council, Ministers, you have in your own hands the key to unlocking these debates and negotiations so that all the Member States can move forward, so that the euro that is at the level of Brussels can return to the level of the citizens in the Member States and be much more productive and create new jobs at a European level. I beg you, the opportunity is still there. As a Christmas present, you must tell us that the own funds and own resources of Europe are starting to be the subject of serious discussion and serious negotiation under your Presidency. I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this.Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report sends a clear message: the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy. The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes. A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world. Culture is a significant asset. It contributes to a living and long-lasting democracy. Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society. Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union’s success for the Mediterranean. It leads nations to share and interact with one another, respect and better understand each other every day.

Mr President, the European Union has finally imposed sanctions on Syria. Unfortunately, however, it appears to have done so with some trepidation, taking care to avoid calling the head of the Syrian regime into question. This lack of determination and clarity is obviously interpreted by the demonstrators as a form of abandonment and by the authorities as an indulgence enabling them to step up their repression, a repression so cruel that it is unimaginable that Syria may be elected to sit on the UN’s Human Rights Council when the country’s authorities are right now refusing UN observers access to the city of Deraa, the scene of terrible violence against unarmed civilians. Having Syria on the Human Rights Council would be an insult to the victims and their families, and an encouragement for that regime to use brute force against its own people, with complete disregard for the values that the Human Rights Council is supposed to uphold. So, Baroness Ashton, what diplomatic options do you have in mind in order to avoid such a disaster? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I supported this resolution because I am convinced that the European Union’s desire to bolster its presence within international organisations is entirely legitimate. European citizens, through our governments, have given a legal personality and specific powers to the Union. European integration has built on a set of fundamental values that are constantly being extended. We have a duty to coordinate our activities and to promote the unity of our Union, as we have already done in the World Trade Organisation. More work remains to be done. However, there are some encouraging signs. The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools (appointment of a High Representative, creation of the European External Action Service). With its newly improved status, the Union will now be able to express its position within the United Nations General Assembly. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report provides a good overview of the current state of relations between the European Union and Iceland. Ever since the Treaty of Paris, we have maintained friendly, close and cooperative links with that country. It has been hard hit by the economic, financial and banking crisis. Reforms must be undertaken, and we must encourage them. Since the start of the accession process, we have begun an open and constructive dialogue with the Icelandic Government, which has also expressed a desire to join the euro area. Enlargement to include Iceland will allow for greater European policy coherence in the Arctic region, especially where fisheries, maritime transport, scientific research and environmental conservation are concerned. However, Europe is not a crutch or a cure for an economic crisis. It is up to Iceland to clearly subscribe to a genuine project of integration with the rest of Europe. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 We need to rethink our policy on the Southern Mediterranean. The European Neighbourhood Policy was supposed to promote the values of democracy and human rights, yet the events that have been taking place in the Southern Mediterranean since the start of the year show that we failed on that score. Admittedly, cooperation in areas such as education and modernisation of the economy has borne fruit. The same cannot be said of good governance, judicial reform and democracy, which are nonetheless headline objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This text has the merit of proposing solutions for radically rethinking this policy. I hope that the European Commission and the Council will be able to take inspiration from it.

The resolution on the situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen rightly denounces the brutal and murderous repression whose victims are the demonstrators in Syria, as well as those in Yemen and Bahrain. The leaders of these three countries are giving orders to fire on their own people, who are legitimately demanding political freedom, human dignity and social fairness. Through this resolution, the European Parliament is strongly expressing its solidarity with the Syrian, Bahraini and Yemeni citizens, who are showing great courage in demonstrating their aspirations while faced with government forces who are opening fire on unarmed civilians.

 I voted in favour of this text on migratory flows. Indeed, the events that our southern neighbours are currently going through are resulting in high levels of migration to European shores. Now more than ever, we have to coordinate our foreign and immigration policies. This is a truly European issue and now is not the time for national egoism. The Mediterranean countries of the European Union should not have to cope alone with the large influx of illegal migrants: this effort should be shared by all EU countries. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament’s clear position. We encourage the Commission to fight violence against women. Of course, there are preventive and repressive legal mechanisms in all the Member States. However, it is also the responsibility of Europe to take up this issue, which falls within its remit. It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis. Dominique Baudis,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels, Mrs Brantner and Mrs Jäätteenmäki, with whom we prepared these amendments. Thanks to the amendments, we have a report that fully accounts for the events taking place in the Gulf, and which states very clearly Parliament’s position on the repression afflicting that region. The first amendment, 16th new citation, is as follows: ‘- having regard to the declarations by the High Representative of 10, 15 and 17 March, and the Council conclusions of 21 March on Bahrain and underlining in this context its full support for the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to peacefully demonstrate,’ This is the first amendment, and it is of course the English-language version, which has been distributed, that is deemed authentic. Dominique Baudis,  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
The second amendment, recital A, is as follows: ‘Whereas current EU-GCC relations require constant reviewing and updating in view of recent important and rapidly unfolding developments on the ground, which are evolving rapidly, at the heart of which needs to be the pursuit of human rights and democracy.’ Dominique Baudis,  (PPE
) 
. – (FR)
 A new recital A bis: ‘A bis. Whereas demonstrators have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations in several GCC States; whereas the violent reaction of the authorities to the protests in Bahrain resulted in deaths, injuries and imprisonments; whereas Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti troops have arrived in the country under the banner of the GCC to participate in the repression of demonstrators,’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 In paragraph 7, after the first paragraph, the first indent should now read: ‘- ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, with special regard to the freedom of speech and of assembly and the right to demonstrate peacefully, and to listen to and take into account the legitimate demands of protesters as well as to ensure their security;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7a: ‘7a. Calls on all Member States in the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognise a continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region, and calls for the full engagement with emerging civil society groups to promote a process of genuine peaceful democratic transition, within their own countries, with partners in the region and with the full support of the European Union;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7b: ʻ7b. Expresses its deep concern at the violent response of and the use of force against protesters by Bahraini authorities and at the participation of foreign troops under the GCC banner in the repression of demonstrators; whereas this stands in stark contrast to the GCC’s support for the protection of the citizens demanding freedom and democracy in Libya; calls for an immediate end to violence against peaceful protesters and for a political dialogue that can lead to further necessary political reforms in the country;ʼ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 18a: ‘18a. Takes note of the declaration by the GCC of 7 March 2011 in Abu Dhabi, which states that “the Ministerial council demands that the Security Council takes the steps necessary to protect civilians, including a no-fly zone in Libya”, which declaration has contributed to the decision of the Arab League and then the United Nations Security Council to pronounce themselves in favour of such a zone;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it expresses the solidarity of the people of Europe with Japan. Parliament is highlighting the courage of the Japanese in this crisis, the most serious since the Second World War, which has so severely affected their country. Among Japan’s friends, Europeans have immediately reported themselves for duty to lend a helping hand to the people afflicted. However, the archipelago is faced with a nuclear problem that is of extreme concern and requires our full attention. It suits Europe to provide all its assistance and expertise to the Japanese authorities in order to prevent a catastrophe of the devastating consequences of which we are unfortunately all too well aware.

 Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for their collaboration. As you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Our work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world. Since then, we have observed everywhere – including in the Gulf – powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. However, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report – and the amendments adopted in committee – raised all the issues that are behind the uprising. We condemn all forms of discrimination – including those founded on gender or religion – we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights. As the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom. We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to take part in the repression, and we express our grave concern in respect of the violent response of those in power. Finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition. Obviously, this report also outlines long-term strategic prospects. It touches on the potential of a partnership in many areas (geopolitics, energy, education and science and in the area of regional integration). From a geopolitical point of view, Iran clearly represents a genuine threat. Between Iran and Israel, the Gulf States would inevitably be the collateral victims of a conflict. These countries expect a lot from us in trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The GCC countries, which make up a quarter of Arab League member states, play a very important role in the peace process. Let us remember that they are behind the Arab peace initiative. With regard to energy, the GCC is the European Union’s leading oil supplier, so the EU is highly dependent on these countries, but their oil reserves are dwindling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy. We can offer our experience in this area. On an educational and scientific level, these countries are making education one of their priorities. Because of the limited number of universities and lecturers, we are seeing units of prestigious American universities being set up. Unfortunately, the European Union, although committed, is very much lagging behind the United States. For example, only eight students from GCC countries came to Europe last year as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme. Finally, in the area of regional integration, the GCC is slow to make progress. Wiser for its experience, the European Union can offer its help, advice and know-how; finally, we call for the signing of a free trade agreement which has been in negotiation for over 20 years.

 I voted for this resolution, which is a step in the right direction as regards the reaction of the European Union to the revolution, which is degenerating into civil war, in Libya. Revolutions are a dream that becomes reality, but civil war is a nightmare. With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi’s troops and mercenaries, and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime, we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them. We have heard the appeal that the Interim Transitional National Council made on 5 March. It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime. With no direct military presence on Libyan soil, a no-fly zone should be considered. But the decision rests with the UN. However, this option could only be envisaged with the explicit consent of the Arab League. At a political and diplomatic level, we have to ensure that Colonel Gaddafi is isolated and help the Libyan people to finally regain their freedom. Dominique Baudis  (PPE
),

 The revolutions in the Arab world must not divert our attention from the Middle East peace process. On the contrary, they are an opportunity to be seized. Palestine is due to hold presidential and legislative elections before the summer, and the Palestinian Authority wants to establish legitimate institutions and manage its security. The ongoing construction of Israeli settlements is an injustice and a provocation to the Palestinians. Today, we have the opportunity, with this wind of freedom that is blowing over the whole of the Arab world, to relaunch the negotiations. The EU must take the initiative to relaunch them. Why not do so within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 With this vote, Parliament has reached another milestone on the road towards global financial regulation. We have sent a strong message in favour of the projects of the French Presidency of the G20. When the economy shows its first signs of recovery, we will have to work together to promote a well thought-out, balanced model of liberalism. The European left tried to take sole credit for the idea of taxing financial transactions. It was misguided, however. Europeans know when to be pragmatic. Today’s vote shows that this notion extends beyond all political differences. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which I believe is fair and balanced. The people of Egypt are seeing their legitimate expectations met. Mr Mubarak’s departure is an essential condition, but it is not enough to ensure that Egypt embarks on a path towards democracy and human rights. The transition is being overseen by the army, which has given itself six months to rise to this challenge. During the 18 days of demonstrations that led to this result, Egypt suffered financial losses, and they are becoming worse each day. The European Union must offer its support to Egypt so that the achievements of the revolution are not destroyed by a harsh economic and social crisis. So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results, and this has not done much for the EU’s image. However, our role remains crucial. We should not criticise ourselves unfairly. Revolutions are peculiar in that they always seem inevitable after the fact but impossible before it. However, self-criticism is justifiable, and we are on the right track, since the Council and the Commission have demonstrated their desire to radically rethink the European neighbourhood policy.

The sudden arrival of thousands of migrants on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is an exceptional event. However, this event brings us face to face with a problem which concerns all Europeans. Right now, it is important that European solidarity should function properly. I agree with you, Commissioner, in your appeal to the Member States to deliver urgent aid to Italy, both in terms of goods and in terms of finance. Very often, in these situations, the countries in which migrants arrive are not their final destinations. Reception centres are frequently outdated, and serious tensions sometimes arise in areas where migrants are received. We have already passed some significant milestones in the fight against illegal immigration and in regulating flows. However, in a Union where internal borders have practically disappeared, Europe must equip itself in the long term with the means to achieve its ambitions. It must create a genuine immigration policy, open a constructive dialogue with countries of origin and strengthen the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) in its missions.

 This motion for a resolution reaffirms Europeans’ commitment to the root-and-branch reforms sought by the people of Tunisia. Europe has maintained a special relationship with the people of Tunisia for a long time. It was the only international organisation to introduce clauses relating to respect for human rights and democratic values into its relations with Tunisia. European economic assistance, provided within the context of the neighbourhood policy, has helped to improve the average standard of living, to create employment, to train young people and to provide access for women to positions of responsibility. Europe is today anxious to support the people of Tunisia in the democratic transition that is beginning. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the situation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion, which condemns the deadly attacks against Christians in the East. The attacks against Christians in recent months are a tragedy for the many victims, particularly in Baghdad and Alexandria, but also for their co-religionists. Christians have lived in the East for 2 000 years; they are inscribed in the history of their country. Today, however, they are fleeing the region en masse. Because of this forced exile, these countries are losing a substantial proportion of their human resources. The Near and Middle East regions have always been an area of diversity and cohabitation of religious minorities. The terrorists behind these attacks are trying to instigate a clash between East and West, pitting the Muslim world against the Christian world. All of this has been fiendishly planned. Christians in Iraq and Egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed. It is important that the Egyptian and Iraqi authorities find and harshly judge the authors of these massacres.

 For the next six months, you will hold the Presidency of the Council, and many challenges await you. You are making the exit from the crisis your top priority. I am convinced that under your Presidency, the institutions and the Member States will continue to work well together. It is our duty to ensure the long-term survival of the solidarity and stabilisation mechanisms, which have already shown their worth. In order to achieve our aims, we will also have to focus on reforming the international financial system. We, in Europe, have been the forerunners of the regulation and supervision of the financial markets. The French Presidency of the G20 is an opportunity that must be grasped. A united Europe should set an example to its foreign partners. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a key instrument in the Union’s foreign policy. Thanks to it, we maintain stable relationships with our closest neighbours. The Eastern Partnership, which is one of your priorities, should not be promoted at the expense of the Mediterranean Partnership. The Union for the Mediterranean is losing momentum and is equally deserving of our attention. Europe remains its firm supporter. What do you intend to do to revive it? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The citizens’ initiative is finally to see the light of day. This incredible democratic innovation will lay the foundations for a new European citizenship. It will become the instrument which enables the European public to give direct expression to their concerns on subjects which may be crucial to our common future. The scope for intervention is as important as the extended mandate of the Union. The European Parliament is encouraging rapid, effective implementation. This initiative was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and it still remained to the European institutions to come to an agreement on practical arrangements. The conditions for organising an initiative, which Parliament wanted to be flexible (a million people from at least a quarter of the Member States, which equates to seven countries today), will give citizens concerned all they need to request the Commission to propose a new legislative text. This will become a possibility next year. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The European Union must grant itself a budget equal to its ambitions. It must not let itself be carried along by the crisis but rise to the challenges it meets. With the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now plays on a level playing field with the Council and has made its mark as a proactive force. I voted for the 2011 budget as it is incumbent on us, as MEPs, to give Europe clear political direction. In 2011 Europe will keep its priorities on target. It will be able to revise upwards its financial needs in order to implement its new powers. Despite difficult economic circumstances, Parliament has managed to win a firm commitment from the Member States. On the proposal of Parliament, in 2011 the Commission will begin discussions on the different types of own resources, resources which Europe needs to guarantee its financial autonomy in the future. However, I am deeply concerned that Parliament has not found a consensus on the additional funding that the ‘Iter’ project will need from 2012. The experimental thermonuclear reactor, a flagship project of international research and European scientific dynamism, could have benefited from an unused and surplus portion of the 2011 budget.

 Looking carefully at the images available on the Internet, one can measure the level of violence used against the Moroccan law enforcement authorities. The scenes witnessed at both the Gdaim Izyk camp and on the road to Laâyoune are evidence of the deadly acts of violence against the Moroccan security services. Not even the emergency vehicles were spared. The reality is very far removed from what the propaganda would have us believe. Our Parliament therefore needs to show restraint and use discretion rather than unduly laying the blame on the Moroccan authorities and holding them fully responsible for this situation.

The financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules. Having stated in September that it was determined to supervise the markets, the European Parliament has today, 11 November, sent another powerful message to the rest of the world. From now on, alternative investment funds (hedge funds) entering Europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by Europe. What is more, they will have to be declared to the authorities and managed within the European Union. The non-regulation of these resources caused many bankruptcies, stock exchange crashes and social crises. France is about to take over the G20 Presidency for a year. Its main priority will be to reform the international financial system. With this vote, Europe is blazing a trail. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The financial, economic and social crisis has now been raging for two years. It has resulted in an unemployment rate of more than 10% in the EU and in the risk of a new recession. This is a crisis that we are unable to bring under control. The next G20 summit will take place on 11 and 12 November in Seoul, under the Presidency of France. Establishing the G20 was the brainchild of President Sarkozy, who believes that nowadays, the global economy is no longer regulated by the 8, but by all the major developing countries, too. This framework allows for the development of an ambition grounded in a long-term vision. This crisis demands that we have genuine economic governance, rules restricting social dumping in developing countries, financial regulation, and a reform of the international monetary system. To achieve this, Europe must know how to speak with one strong and determined voice. Dominique Baudis  (PPE
),

 By voting today, Thursday, 7 October 2010 on a resolution, the European Parliament is demanding that the Commission give thought to significantly improving cohesion policy instruments. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion is no longer just economic and social; it is also territorial. Regional policy is one of the spearheads of European integration. It is the second heading in the Union’s budget, after the common agricultural policy. Europe needs to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of its regions. The development of cross-border transport links is one of the major challenges of this policy. One of the priorities in this area is the route across the Pyrenees between France and Spain, which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West. At the moment, the road and rail links do not meet expectations. Some regions, although linked from a socio-economic point of view, do not today enjoy adequate means of communication. The various projects that the Commission is due to carry forward in this geographical area will be carried out in the medium and long terms. They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013. Dominique Baudis  (PPE
),

Cross-border cooperation is essential for our neighbouring countries. How is it possible to have a prosperous and sustainable economy if the borders are closed? It provides better border security and intelligent management of migratory flows. However, some of our neighbouring regions, such as the Maghreb, do not know how to work together. In the majority of cases where cross-border cooperation among our neighbours is at a standstill there is an unfinished conflict with a long history behind it. It is obviously crucial that we give our neighbours the resources to cooperate. However, in order for the budgets allocated to be really useful, we need the European Union, in other words, you, Mr Füle, and especially Baroness Ashton, to be present on the political stage. It needs to be in a position to have an influence, be heard and be respected. Otherwise the Union for the Mediterranean is doomed to failure. In addition, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument creates a multitude of documents and suffers as a result of its complexity or even opacity. Parliament has almost no right to see the strategy documents and national indicative programmes. We must be consulted more often and be better informed, and the procedure must be simplified.

With the new competences that it has acquired since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union needs to rely on strong diplomacy. The European External Action Service (EEAS) represents considerable progress in this respect. I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on the EEAS because, in order to succeed in her mission, the High Representative urgently needs to acquire a competent diplomatic arm. My decision is based on the conclusions of the Madrid Conference of 21 June, where an institutional balance was found. The European interest of the initial draft has been retained. The Commission, the Council and Parliament will now be able to work together to establish an effective and operational European diplomatic service. I am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the EEAS will respect this balance. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you will now hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union for six months. Numerous challenges await you, including the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), one of the major advances in the Treaty of Lisbon. The agreement reached between the various institutions envisages that the Service will be created by January 2011, even though it took more than seven months to negotiate its organisational structure. The actual and effective creation of the EEAS is now a matter of urgency, because the Treaty of Lisbon’s credibility is at stake, together with Europe’s image within the international community. Your experience of negotiating and reaching compromises will help in the actual implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. We wish you every success. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, this attack on civilian ships by Israeli commandos clearly demands an impartial and credible inquiry. However, what confidence can we have in a commission that would be the judge in its own case? This attack took place in international waters; it therefore concerns the international community and it affects Europe in particular, as Europe has a Mediterranean coastline. Europe should make itself heard more and should become more closely involved in the search for a political solution based on two states with each having Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is making significant financial efforts to help develop the Palestinian Territories, but, unfortunately, it is too absent from the political process which should lead to the creation of this Palestinian state. The financial and budgetary goodwill that we are showing is not enough. We must also express political will and give ourselves the means to make ourselves heard. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, in the follow-up to the Barcelona process, the Union for the Mediterranean is an opportunity to develop our relations with the countries to the east and south of the Mediterranean basin. As the excellent report by Vincent Peillon emphasises, we cannot neglect either the potential of this region or the risks which it brings with it. Let us at least have the presence of mind to recognise that, since the bombing of Gaza and with the continuing colonisation of Palestinian territories, the Union for the Mediterranean has been painted into a corner. The political aspect is blocked. We are not even sure if the planned summit in Barcelona in June will actually take place. I would not be surprised if we were to learn in the coming days or hours that it has been postponed indefinitely. However, we should not give up; the European Union should assume greater responsibility in the search for a political solution. We cannot allow the United States to monopolise political crisis management in this region, our region, and confine ourselves to its development. Our security and growth depend on the development and stability of the Mediterranean, which is why the Union for the Mediterranean is still the best instrument at our disposal. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid any caricatures – we have heard one or two this morning – I would like to mention some objective facts regarding Tunisia, a partner country of the European Union. The social situation has evolved very favourably, with a spectacular increase in the average per capita income, and now the vast majority of Tunisians meet the criteria defining membership of the middle class. More than 90% of Tunisians enjoy welfare cover, and more than a quarter of Tunisia’s budget is devoted to education, with the result that the country is one of the very first to have achieved the Millennium Development Goals in the area of primary education. Finally, as Mr Michel highlighted a little while ago, women’s rights are both recognised and guaranteed. At university level, female students outnumber male students, and 40% of teachers are women. A quarter of politicians, local officials and journalists are women. Many countries would be envious of these statistics. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, the acts of fanatic criminals, who have killed some Christians in Egypt, cannot be ascribed to an entire population and its government. It would be unfair to hold Egypt and the Egyptians responsible for this appalling massacre, for which the perpetrators will be brought to justice. We must not confuse the acts of one criminal with the policy of an entire country! Let us not tar fanatics and an entire population with the same brush. Finally, by seeking to intervene between the Coptic Christians and their fellow Muslim citizens, we are adding fuel to the fire of the extremists, who want to portray Eastern Christians as agents of the West.

Many challenges await you in the field of foreign policy, especially as regards the southern shore of the Mediterranean. What do you intend to do to relaunch the Union for the Mediterranean, the headquarters of which are located in Barcelona? The Secretary General of the Union for the Mediterranean has recently been appointed. How do you envisage your collaboration with the Union for the Mediterranean’s first ever Secretary General?

During the last Foreign Affairs Council, the Council of the European Union made it known that it wanted a Palestinian state to be created in the near future, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is thus outlining the conditions of a viable solution to the Middle East conflict that is acceptable to both parties. The solution proposed by the Council is fair. Israel and Palestine can use it as a basis on which to exchange land for peace. The European Union has a major role to play. It can support inter-Palestinian reconciliation, without which there will be no Palestinian interlocutor in the negotiations with Israel. It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 Mr President, the SESAR programme, which aims to modernise air traffic management in Europe, is a major project. How is the Commission going to prepare for the forthcoming SESAR deployment phase and, in particular, for the financing of this programme, which is essential both for the environment and for our scientific and technical standing? Will the Commission follow the recommendations of the 2007 report, according to which a highly qualified individual should ensure political monitoring of this programme? Indeed, a number of obstacles will have to be overcome – of a legal, psychological and technical nature – to unite national airspaces and to succeed in getting controllers from the various countries to work together. If Europe is not able to create a single airspace, how will it be able to build a strong political union? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Following the negotiations at the European Council of 29 and 30 October and the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court of 3 November, the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, has signed the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty will now be able to enter into force, providing the institutions with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and with a stable President of the Council for two and a half years. The structure of the new Commission, like the choice of figures who will occupy the posts of President of the Council and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, are crucial. The choice of President of the Council is crucial since it is he or she who will embody Europe for two and a half years. Moreover, at a time of globalisation and of power struggles between continents, the choice of High Representative for Foreign Affairs is of undeniable strategic importance. On 19 November, an extraordinary European Council will meet to negotiate the nominations. We are at a turning point in European history. The choices that you make, Heads of State or Government, will determine the Europe that you want in the future. Therefore, be ambitious, because Europe must be dynamic, proactive, effective and political if we want it to continue to progress. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job-creating growth. That was the agenda of the G20 in Pittsburgh. On the other hand – and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference – it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption. In other words, we must restart the machine and ensure that that machine pollutes less. Moreover, these two issues cannot be resolved one after the other; they are both urgent. Relaunching economic activity is urgent, and limiting the consequences of economic activity is urgent. At the G20 yesterday, and at the climate-change conference tomorrow, the European Union must tread a narrow path between two equally formidable threats. The European institutions must be established as quickly as possible under the Treaty of Lisbon adopted by the 27 countries of the Union. By ‘playing for time’ to delay this moment, the Czech President, Mr Klaus, has a big responsibility towards the 500 million citizens of the Union. Jean-Marie Cavada,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this somewhat late hour the students are, I trust, sleeping, and it will not be long before their teachers are doing the same. We, however, are still up. Drawing as it does on the Commission’s last report on the European Schools’ system, our report aims to improve the European Schools concept, which must be adapted to the new economic requirements and the changes in society. This concept must remain a model of inspiration for national school systems, promoting European citizenship and encouraging increased mobility, as well as the learning of the languages of the Member States, the languages of the countries of Europe. These are the main points of this report: first, it contains a set of policy priorities to improve this educational model in Europe, in particular by establishing an appropriate legal basis for it, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The current legal status has reached its limits and requires a radical change to allow the Union to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the work of the Member States, without, of course, superseding their competence, and to adopt legally binding acts to that end pursuant to Articles 2 and 6 of the TFEU. I believe that Article 165 of the Treaty could be a perfectly appropriate legal basis. The European Schools must set an educational example by basing themselves on the dissemination of European culture, values, integration and languages. It is, therefore, essential for the Member States to cooperate when developing their national syllabuses, drawing on the simple example, which has worked wonderfully well up to now, of the teaching approach used by the European Schools. The opening of Type II and Type III Schools must be wholeheartedly encouraged. It is in this spirit that the report insists that holders of the European baccalaureate should be able, once and for all, to apply to any university in the EU, with the same rights as nationals of the country in question who hold equivalent qualifications, as it is essential that the baccalaureate is automatically recognised in all of the Union’s Member States. In this difficult period, I wished to stress the absolute need to rationalise the Schools’ management costs, without calling into question the fundamental principles on which the concept rests, especially mother-tongue teaching by native speakers, in order to maintain the quality of this teaching. Similarly, I believe it is essential to maintain equal and equivalent teaching conditions for the children of all language communities in the European Schools. It is, therefore, with a concern for fairness that the report highlights, in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, the plan to see general use of the working languages for teaching all non-fundamental subjects, without, of course, this being detrimental to those whose mother tongue is not one of the working languages. To ensure good governance of the European Schools, very serious attention must be paid to the lack of seconded staff. This must be compensated for by local recruitment of teachers, whose salaries should be paid by the Schools. The Board of Governors must, therefore, ensure that Member States that do not contribute financially by seconding teachers pay an equivalent financial contribution to the Schools’ budget. I wished to reaffirm moreover that, in these difficult times in particular, provision for students with special educational needs remains a priority, and I have asked the Board of Governors, in this regard, to ensure that coefficients are applied to this category of student when calculating class sizes in order to ensure their full integration. Finally, Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to repeat my call to the Board of Governors to work on providing alternatives that allow students who are unable to complete the course to find vocational courses. I would not wish to finish this presentation without thanking the Commission, my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs, and especially the parents’ associations, who have enabled us to reach a consensus on which to progress this issue. Forgive me for having stolen 45 seconds from you. Jean Marie Cavada  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this is such a serious matter that one must rise above the dreadful arguments that I have just heard in this House, because when we talk about the media we are talking about the health of a democracy. President-in-Office of the Council, I am one of those people who admire and feel affection for your country and for the Hungarian people. I fully understand that your government and some members of the public wanted information to be handled in a more balance way, and, objectively speaking, they were right. However, replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right. Consequently I am pleased this evening, but I am vigilant. I am pleased to see that your government has decided to return to several fundamental points and to change the December 2001 law on the media. This needed to be done and you did well to address this matter. I am also pleased that you are once more showing greater respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights which your people have always craved in the course of recent history. I would like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Kroes, and I support the composition of her group of monitoring experts. However, we will be vigilant, because we also feel that a number of points have not been dealt with, and we shall also pay attention to the details of the legislative amendments. In conclusion, I should like to tell you, President-in-Office of the Council, that you are the heirs to the fatherland of Liszt, of Kossuth, of the 1940 hero, Joël Brand, of Sándor Kopácsi and Colonel Maléter of 1956. You are the heirs of Sándor Márai. You are the heirs of Imre Kertész. So do not let us down! It was a Hungarian who invented the magical game that is Rubik’s cube. Do not teach us, in Europe, to play with the media in the style of a ‘Jobbik’s Cube’ because that is a dreadful game. Jean-Marie Cavada  (PPE

Presidents, we are very fearful of the future of banking. The economy has transferred its toxic debts to finance; finance has passed the buck to the Member States, and the Member States are now turning to the citizens, who will have to pay, if they are able to. Now, Mr Leterme, you know far better than I that Europe must now perform its historic duty; in other words, it must impose a Community approach on Europe’s national leaders in terms of common discipline, certainly, but also in terms of recovery and innovation. In this drama which is being played out before us, there is no longer any national way out of the global crisis. Many European leaders – your colleagues – are watching the popularity ratings. At the moment, Europe’s leaders must look at history before history itself submerges us in the chaos of populism. Belgium is a country that was always strong on European patriotism; whether it is in a good or a bad state is immaterial. It is the will, discipline and objectivity of its leaders that will save us.

 I voted for this resolution, since it strikes a good balance in condemning the serious acts of violence between Israel and Hamas. The cessation of rocket attacks is imperative and cannot be up for negotiation. Terror is not a policy and Hamas must understand that. Equally, however, while there can be no question that Israel is entitled to protect itself, Tzahal should be more measured in its retaliation. The blockade on the Gaza Strip has been going on for too long now. Tel-Aviv must loosen its grip on this narrow strip of land. Its actions are counter-productive from a security viewpoint and create an intolerable humanitarian situation for the Palestinians. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted in favour of this report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, as it makes a pertinent assessment of the Union’s record on the matter and of the challenges that we must prepare to tackle together. It is important not to allow Europe to enter a strategic decline. The European Union has the tools to pursue a truly ambitious policy in security and defence. As the report indicates, the European Union must preserve its military intervention capability, but also its capacity to intervene by civilian, economic, humanitarian and commercial means to deal with the new situations that are arising in the world, sometimes at the fringes of Europe. I believe that Parliament is making a clear appeal for Member States to make a stronger commitment to the Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the only way of maintaining the strategic weight of a Europe that has fallen prey to budgetary difficulties in a multipolar world.

 I voted in favour of these two texts on migration from the Schengen Information System (1+) to SIS II. Our first message is clear: this migration was decided on several years ago, it is very delayed and it is now time to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently in the all of the Member States. We therefore urge the Council to get this system up and running without any further delay. Moreover, the SIS is a vital component of the Schengen system and Europe’s internal structure for the fight against organised crime and for internal security. This second version will modernise this database and, above all, provide a central structure under the Community system. The migration and, more generally, the database are subject to one absolutely fundamental principle (which is reiterated in both texts): stringent rules on the protection of personal data.

 In the lively debate on shale gas in the European Union and its Member States, there is no absolute truth. There is clearly a halfway point between those who are pro shale gas and those who are anti it, and it is essential to take the heat out of the debate. It would be a major strategic error to renounce this energy source now without even continuing the research. Equally, however, allowing unbridled exploration when the technique is not yet fully developed would be environmental madness. Shale gas has undeniable potential and we need to look at it seriously. As things stand, however, shale gas exploration puts the environment at risk and it would be irresponsible to go down that path. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The International Convention on the Rights of the Child, the anniversary of which was the actual day of this vote, states that a child is not simply a fragile being in need of protection but a person with the right to be educated, cared for and protected regardless of the part of the world where he or she is born. On this International Children’s Rights Day, the European Parliament passed by a large majority a resolution on the protection of children in the digital world against the risks of violence, fraud, child pornography and sexual harassment which children may encounter on the internet. Our resolution strongly asks States to make additional efforts to combat illegal and harmful content on the internet, to minimise the risks of internet use for children, while insisting on the importance of educating children in the new digital media. At a time when internet surfing is becoming a habit for our children, we need to provide enhanced protection for them. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The crisis we have experienced since 2008 has shown up the cracks in the current architecture for economic and monetary union. Today we need to learn from the crisis and give the EU the frameworks it needs to ensure it remains economically and financially stable as well as prosperous. That is the very meaning of this report. By voting in favour I also wanted to support two demands relating to democracy and social issues, which I believe are essential to this next wave of integration. Firstly, I believe strengthening economic and monetary union can only happen alongside a guarantee of greater democracy, which requires the involvement of and supervision by the European Parliament and national parliaments. Secondly, in view of the serious social crisis facing several Member States, I particularly support the recommendation to introduce social and employment benchmarks alongside current fiscal and macroeconomic benchmarks.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 is to be the European Year of Citizens, the year of European citizenship, 20 years after the creation of European citizenship and, as has been said several times this evening, one year before the renewal of the European Parliament. It is therefore a very symbolic year, even a very serious year, particularly in the present context. In fact, the latest surveys show that, since autumn 2009, there has been a very worrying and very noticeable trend towards a serious and very substantial loss of confidence in Community actions and the Community acquis
, even, when it comes to rights and freedoms, within the European Union itself. Faced with this situation, the essential question has always been, and still is, the need to consolidate a European identity, to succeed in creating a common feeling of belonging, to make a real success of defining the shape of this European citizenship, a shape which will be applicable to all Europeans. There is no doubt that this objective which has been announced can be achieved in 2013, but only by means of more information, more dialogue, more meetings, more exchanges and more sharing. Although I am delighted with the excellent quality of the text, I wish that our institutions, when making their choices and decisions, would show enough determination to give themselves the means of achieving their objectives, and would thereby demonstrate a strong political willingness to practice what they preach. Moreover, though of course I am happy about the results obtained in the negotiations, in particular by Ms Papadopoulou, who showed great determination, especially regarding the broadening of the scope of this European Year of Citizens in the decision-making process, the European civil dialogue, etc., I have strong reservations about the ridiculous budget allocated to this European Year, the smallest ever given to a European Year. Since the task is so enormous, I am sorry that the Council and certain members of the Committee on Budgets have refused to grant resources for this Year, which is, without doubt, one of the most important and one which, in my opinion, should be regarded as the Union’s first priority, because without European citizens we have no Europe and we cannot integrate Europe.

 I voted firmly in favour of this report, which, once again, strongly condemns the inadmissible practices of ‘extraordinary rendition’, secret prisons and torture, and, above all, EU Member States’ complicity in these CIA ‘programmes’. We have been demanding, for years now, that Member States involved in such activities conduct thorough, impartial and independent inquiries into the failings and abuses which occurred, and demanding that the European Union bring its action in line with its values. In this new report, we restate these demands. More detailed enquiries must be carried out and responsibility must be determined. The adoption of this report is a new step towards remedying these inadmissible practices. However, much work still remains to be done in order to establish the truth and acknowledge all of the violations which were committed. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

By adopting this own-initiative report, we wanted to send a clear message – separately from the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the asylum package – that the Dublin II system, whose faults and limitations have become clear, needs to be reformed. Our message is twofold: it emphasises both responsibility and solidarity. This is because it is fundamentally necessary to increase solidarity among European states in the area of asylum, as has become clear following the recent migratory flows following the events in Tunisia, then in Libya and now in Syria. More than ever, Europe needs a genuine common European asylum system, and there is an urgent need to implement European directives on asylum in order to make our European asylum system credible and efficient.

 The European Union had to react to the Mediator scandal, which claimed hundreds of victims, due to a lack of effective alert and response mechanisms in the face of a harmful drug. I voted for this amendment to the European legislation on pharmacovigilance because I think it is moving in the right direction: that of transparency and control. I think that the three main measures it introduces are very important: the real reasons behind a company’s decision to withdraw a medicine in a country will be known, these medicines will be systematically subjected to an urgent assessment, which will reveal the levels of hazard, and finally, a symbol on the medicine’s packaging will inform patients and practitioners if the medicine has been subject to an additional safety study. Within the framework of the organisation of the market for medicine, in which the EU has some powers, these measures will help to ensure, at EU level, that a health crisis such as the one we saw with Mediator will never happen again.

 I felt it was important to vote in favour of this resolution, which reaffirms certain principles regarding the donation of tissues and cells. It is an ethical requirement. However, several Member States do not take it into consideration: donations of tissue and cells should be voluntary, unpaid and, without any exception, anonymous. These ethical failures in certain Member States are set in an environment of regular revelations of cases of trafficking in human products. The main reason for my vote is to send a message to the Member States that they must put a stop to this trafficking. The scope of this resolution goes beyond ethical questions and addresses the issues of public health and the fight against criminal activities. Moreover, this resolution encourages the creation of systems allowing for greater European and international cooperation, aimed at improving the management of the growing need for human tissues and cells for innovative treatments, a need that, in itself, constitutes a major challenge for public health.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate our two co-rapporteurs on their work. After intense negotiations, which were difficult but exceedingly well organised, they managed to come to an agreement with the EU Council that will allow minimum standards on the protection of victims to be introduced throughout the European Union, marking another stage in the creation of the area of freedom and justice at Community level. Given the current situation, it is rare in the Union to find so many reasons to be satisfied. This evening, we can all welcome the mechanism outlined in this text to protect victims, who form a legal category that, as you said, Commissioner, is often forgotten in our national legal systems. Justice for victims means protecting them, facilitating their access to justice, supporting them and giving them the right to legitimate compensation. It was therefore essential to have this coordinated, integrated approach that benefits victims. I welcome three points in particular. The first is the fact that the Council largely agreed to better protection for children. This text pays particular attention to children and their needs, and to their vulnerability as far as protection is concerned. That is covered by this text, and Article 22 in particular, which enshrines in full the principles and standards advocated by the Council of Europe, and the rights specific to children and their protection. Secondly, as you pointed out, Commissioner, we need to train practitioners and all those likely to come into contact with victims, including civil servants, lawyers, and those responsible for victim support: Article 24 emphasises the need for general and specialist training, which is a good concrete, realistic step forward at Community level. Finally, it is essential to develop the network of host structures to ensure that all victims can find someone nearby who will listen to and support them. This personalised aid is fundamental in the European Union because these victims are often alone and distraught because of these traumatic situations. Now, Commissioner, all that remains is to take the necessary measures to inform the public and raise awareness of this new mechanism. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted resolutely against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) because the Agreement contained too many uncertainties and posed too many serious risks to the fundamental rights of Europeans. The benefit of ACTA, however, was that it tackled some real challenges: protecting intellectual property rights against counterfeiting and piracy, and setting out some real issues for enterprises, creation and intellectual property rights in Europe and in the world, which are essential. However, the negotiations on the agreement did not reconcile these requirements with the protection of citizens’ individual freedoms and fundamental rights. The outcome of the vote could not have been any different. It is an historic vote because it is the first time that the European Parliament has rejected an international trade agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 After many months of negotiations, we have at last adopted the recast of the European railway legislation. Although it does not regulate everything, it nevertheless allows rail transport to be strengthened in the EU, particularly by clarifying the roles of the various actors in the rail transport sector. The flagship measures include strengthening the independence of the national regulators and establishing a European network of regulators in order for there to be a uniform interpretation and application of the legislation. Another vital aspect of this recast is the clarification of financial flows between the infrastructure manager and railway undertaking. This vote does not signal the end of the reform of the European railway market. Indeed, next year, the Commission should present new legislative proposals, particularly on the thorny issue of the liberalisation of national passenger transport and on the separation between the infrastructure management and transport operations.

 Better working conditions and greater compliance with legislation on driving and rest times for drivers in Europe: these are the reasons why I have decided to vote in favour of this text. It is also about creating greater transparency in an industry that is still very opaque. It is too easy to manipulate the tachographs currently in use and they do not provide the necessary guarantees to ensure that drivers’ driving and rest times are recorded efficiently in Europe. That is why it was crucial to adopt a text which lays the foundations for the use of new digital tachographs that will enable more effective checks which are also less restrictive for drivers.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution, which calls for the eCall system to be installed in all new cars by 2015. This is an important step forward for road safety as, were this technology to be introduced, it could enable a great number of lives to be saved on European roads. It is now up to the European Commission to come back to us with a legislative proposal. We in the European Parliament have expressed our view in the clearest possible manner.

 In accordance with European legislation, the Commission has a duty to translate European law and the related documents into all EU official languages to allow citizens, economic operators, NGOs and other interested parties to exercise their rights. However, in reality, many documents are only available in English. These include public consultations, even though they address citizens directly and are a fundamental component of drawing up transparent EU policies. Our resolution therefore urges the Commission to ensure that every EU citizen’s right to address the EU institutions in any of the EU official languages is fully respected and implemented. Respect for multilingualism is a principle, a right which is very important to me and we must defend it. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As Vice-Chair of the Tibet Intergroup, it is with much conviction that I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet. Our Parliament works tirelessly to protect the Tibetan people from the attacks and violence that they have been suffering for many years. In this sitting, we have adopted a new text which calls for the appointment of a special coordinator for respect for human rights in Tibet, which calls for constructive dialogue between China and the Central Tibetan Administration and which also calls on China to grant Tibetans their autonomy and to respect the fundamental rights (freedom of expression, freedom of belief, freedom of association, and so on) of the Tibetan people. Finally, the resolution strongly condemns the Chinese attitude towards Tibetans: the repression, prison sentences, and so on. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The PIP breast implants scandal has brought to light all of the shortcomings in the legislation on breast implants. For years, companies have been able to sell implants with defective gel to thousands of women worldwide without concern. In terms of public health, there should be no half measures. That is the message that I wanted to send by voting for this resolution, which proposes a strict framework so that such mistakes are not made again. We are clearly asking for more safety controls, but also, and above all, for greater traceability and a more restrictive marketing authorisation system. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I am pleased that the issue of the negotiations on the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) has finally been put on the work agenda of our European Parliament, particularly thanks to pressure from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to which I belong. By this, we hope that our Parliament is able to voice its opinion on this matter and that the European institutions adopt a strong common position to find a solution to the problems of arms transfers. Indeed, for the international community to sign a treaty of this nature sends a strong signal, insofar as it will establish common binding standards for the import, export and transfer of arms. This trade must urgently be regulated in view of the arms transfers that fuel conflicts, poverty and violations of the rights of individuals. We are calling for clear, binding provisions, which meet the highest international standards in accordance with international humanitarian law. This problem must urgently be tackled head on if we are to ensure lasting security and stability in the world. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Europe and its institutions are often depicted as being far removed from the citizens and their concerns and needs. Nonetheless, the European Union regularly steps in to assist ‘distressed areas’ or areas ‘experiencing difficulties’, especially through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This week, for example, Parliament has approved support amounting to EUR 1.6 million from the EGF for footwear workers in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain. The industry is currently being hit by highly aggressive competition from Asian countries and is faced with making numerous redundancies. I voted firmly in favour of adopting this report. Such assistance is both natural and essential: Europe is based on solidarity, so when one of its Member States is in difficulty, it is perfectly normal to come to its aid. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted for this report, which aims to strengthen and facilitate cross-border volunteering and to reduce the administrative, legal and linguistic barriers to volunteering. In this report, we call on Member States to set national targets for volunteering and to recognise the rights of volunteers, in particular, by establishing a European statute for volunteering. Our report also suggests introducing an online information portal on issues related to volunteering. 100 million European citizens are currently working in voluntary activities. Volunteering offers an incredible opportunity for exchange and learning, and cross-border volunteering offers great potential for education, employment and citizenship, to improve mutual understanding and help develop a stronger European identity. Volunteering is one way of living as an active European citizen and, being from the only French region that borders three other Member States, that is something close to my heart.

 The issue of equal pay for men and women has been on the political agenda for very many years now, but progress has been extremely slow. That is why I voted in favour of this text, which recommends, amongst other things, laying down stricter penalties for employers who practise pay discrimination of this nature. While I am not in favour of imposing penalties right, left and centre, it is true to say that certain employers today do not comply with rules which were laid down in the past. In 2012, it is no longer acceptable for women to earn around 17% less than men. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Once again, the European Parliament has voted in favour of this financial transaction tax with a large majority. I welcome this vote, which sends a strong signal to the markets and to those Member States still reluctant to impose such a tax. The high-risk behaviour of the financial markets contributed extensively to the crisis we are going through. It is absolutely crucial that they participate in the collective effort being made to get Europe out of this crisis and back on the road to growth.

 As the EU pursues its goal to build a European area of freedom, security and justice, it needs a strong internal security strategy. The own-initiative report that we have adopted by a very wide majority therefore stipulates, first and foremost, that this strategy and all measures that are taken must thoroughly satisfy the obligations placed on them in terms of fundamental rights and upholding the rule of law. Our report then goes on to stress that the strategy must be backed by sufficient financial resources in the next budget period, to allow the European Union to actually address these challenges, and to do so in a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent way. Lastly, our strategy sets out five key areas for action in which the EU provides added value, and for which we need greater European cooperation. I am delighted that this report has been adopted.

 I voted in favour of this report, which sets out a framework for the future development of an EU criminal policy. In the building of a European area of liberties and justice, the criminal sphere has always been treated somewhat separately since it is a rather sensitive area directly affecting regulatory powers. Yet, at the current time, it is difficult to imagine that criminal law should fall outside the scope of constructing a Europe based on laws. The communitisation of criminal law is a considerable challenge, but also a necessity in terms of large-scale crime and cross-border crime, and this is the issue addressed by this report. Moreover, I welcome the perspectives provided by such communitisation in Europe: firstly, ‘eurocrimes’, as well as the creation of a genuine European Public Prosecutor’s Office, whose remit must go well beyond the mere protection of the financial interests of the European Union.

 At a time when the crisis and the disparities between regions are being accentuated within the European Union, territorial cohesion must be at the heart of EU policies now more than ever. It is this basic principle that I wanted to reaffirm by voting for this report. Indeed, regional airports have a key role to play in the economic development of the most remote regions by attracting companies, in particular, and also by enabling the development of tourism. Furthermore, as we are currently discussing the review of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), it would be appropriate, in this debate, to grant regional airports an important place alongside other major European transport nodes. In my view, this seems essential in order to achieve an optimal network across the EU. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution accompanying discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament’s 2010 budget. While I support the general guidelines contained in this resolution, I strongly oppose two clearly anti-Strasbourg amendments (Amendments 6 and 15), which were tabled and incorporated into this resolution. The debate and the attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament resurface with increasing regularity, and I am very mindful of this. Although it was long a symbolic issue, today it has become a predominantly legal and political one. I remain firmly committed to this permanent fight to keep the seat of the European Parliament within our beautiful European capital. Moreover, I voted against Amendment 4, which wanted to abolish the LUX Prize. Awarded each year by the European Parliament, the LUX Prize rewards films that go to the heart of European public debate and illustrate the universality of European values, cultural diversity and the process of European integration.

 While three out of four Europeans use their mobile phone while travelling, many find horrendously high bills waiting for them when they get home. Competition in the mobile roaming sector within the EU is still weak, leading to very high prices for consumers. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached at first reading on a text which I am sure provides effective solutions for improving the situation in the mobile roaming market for European consumers. Firstly, separating the provision of mobile phone services on national territory from roaming services will improve competition, as consumers will be able to choose whether they wish to keep the same communications provider while travelling and benefit from more attractive pricing. Secondly, gradually capping the maximum allowed charges made when billing for voice, SMS and data services between now and 2014 will be hugely beneficial to consumers. Furthermore, consumers will benefit from numerous measures improving transparency, such as the provision of information on roaming tariffs outside the EU, information on accumulated consumption expressed in the unit or currency of billing, and the introduction of safeguard caps (EUR 50 by default).

Once again, pirates from the Horn of Africa are attacking cargo boats off their coasts. Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is not, therefore, in decline. There are increasing numbers of incidents and they are becoming more violent. At the same time, more than 190 sailors are still held hostage and poverty remains ever present in this region of the world. I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, which calls for a strengthening of military resources, and also for solutions to be found to address the root causes of piracy. It is obviously essential to step up military presence, but that must be accompanied by an increase in humanitarian aid. Let us not forget that piracy and violence in the Horn of Africa are nourished, first and foremost, by the extreme poverty that prevails in the region. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Mr President, after being there in July 2011, I was, of course, deeply affected, as we all were, by the stories, the journeys, the courage, the path taken by these men, these women, these children who were suffering, arriving every day in Italy on the island of Lampedusa, before being crammed into detention centres in terrible conditions, sometimes defying all humanity, violating all human dignity, a long way from the much coveted European dream. There are both questions being asked and long-term political effects. Some such questions are: following our visits, we have all denounced the lack of information and today, one year later, we are still lacking information. How are the recent arrivals being managed? How many people have arrived? In what conditions are they living today? How many have been transferred to other centres or to the continent and where are the programmes on the island itself? We would like to know how the Italian authorities have used the more than EUR 232 million given to them to enable them to respond to this difficult situation. However, there are also long-term political effects. Apart from the fact that the paradise shores of the Italian island will forever remain extremely famous – the island of hopes and dreams for the arrival of these many Mediterranean boat people – I regret that this crisis in Lampedusa has brought us where we are today. This migratory crisis has been caused by poor management with regard to the arrival of these immigrants, which has furthermore led us to a famous France-Italy episode, to Italy granting temporary residence permits for migrants, then to the closure of borders by France and by Mr Sarkozy, culminating in a dramatic result for Europe and European integration, to a debate, which is today highly politicised, on the Schengen area, and to a situation where Europeans no longer like Europe because of Schengen and where this is being reflected in the elections. A real policy is therefore needed … (The President cut off the speaker) Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, SWIFT, ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) and PNR (Passenger Name Records) are acronyms that we often hear and which are a source of concern to Europeans who do not really know what lies behind them. What is the reality hidden behind these names? Excessively generalised surveillance of passengers, and an agreement which means that if I take an aeroplane, the United States will know about my dietary tastes, my behaviour at the airport, aspects of my health, and so on. Without going over all the arguments that have been advanced this morning in a long but fascinating debate, I would like to remind you that, since 2007, we have been calling for guarantees, such as red lines, which would have allowed us to obtain an agreement from Parliament. Yet we do not have this at the moment, either in terms of reciprocity or in terms of proportionality, as our admirable colleague, Mr Watson, reminded us in relation to the position taken by the United States, and I would question the proposals of Mrs Foster, which claim that passenger name records do not involve all that much. If they do not involve all that much, then let us call for reciprocity from the United States. In this Chamber, some people are saying that this is the best that we could achieve, that we will not get any more, that we must ask the judges. It is unacceptable to abdicate our responsibilities in this way. It is up to us to create the conditions of balance, of European democracy, between the security of combating terrorism and the preservation of liberties. That is why I will vote against this agreement. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Madam President, although slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, there are still many children, and some women and men, who fall victim to human trafficking in Europe every day. We are talking about domestic slaves, prostitutes, beggars and clandestine workers who live through a genuine ordeal of physical violence, humiliation and, at every stage of this hell, anger. Moreover, in nearly 40% of cases this phenomenon involves children. Totally powerless, these people are taken away, held against their will, beaten, subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, and deprived of their rights. The Union and its Member States have a historic responsibility, as you have reminded us, Commissioner, and we must act together to face up to this criminal activity which flouts the whole spectrum of human rights, particularly those of women. Above all, though, it is of course up to the Union to protect children, the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society. In relation to this cooperation, Commissioner, although the directive does of course represent an advance and a step forward, it is your task to exert strict supervision of the Member States’ responsibilities through specific and tangible measures, so that we can eliminate this veritable cancer which contravenes the foundations of our democratic societies and the values that have been cemented by European integration. What will you do in relation to the Member States’ obligation to transpose the directive? The second question is: what news is there of the information and awareness campaign? Finally, what about the collection of information relating to trafficking in human beings, and what actions could be taken precisely on the basis of this data collection? Nathalie Griesbeck,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have spoken about challenge. While it is true that Greece is facing an enormous challenge, we need, above all, to respond to a challenge facing the European Union: its image in the world, and how the citizens see it. One would have thought that the end of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin wall, would lead us to believe that we would never again see the construction of other walls anywhere in Europe. Yet this is not at all the case. There is an enormous project, devised by Greece, to try to resolve to its huge problems caused by the arrival – as our Greek colleague said – of more than 300 people a day at its borders through a transit country, Turkey, and these are citizens who do not come from Turkey but from many other countries around the world. One would have thought that such a thing would never be seen again. What is more, this phenomenon is accompanied by an utterly disgraceful humanitarian situation, which violates the human rights we are constantly developing, protecting, defending and safeguarding as the most precious gift that the European Union has given to its citizens. The solutions to the problems are, needless to say, difficult, and the messages are complex. Without getting into the technical side of things, it is of course quite clear that solidarity – as Cecilia Malmström has just explained, through the idea of shared responsibility, through technical mechanisms, the funding that must be used, the earmarking of EU funds – should make it possible to provide effective aid and to address the situation in which these people find themselves with dignity and in a manner that is consistent with human rights. The second message, which has often been heard in recent weeks in Europe, is to up the stakes in the construction of texts and a rule of law system conveying the solidarity of the Member States towards Greece, which is coming under pressure along its borders. To ‘up the stakes’ means to construct a veritable arsenal of texts applicable by all and not to miss the point either, like when in my country, France, we talk about re-erecting internal borders when what we should be doing is protecting external borders – in a spirit of humanism, it should be remembered. Finally, Madam President, the third reply, or the third message underlying our proposals, is to have the possibility and the political will to achieve a balance between the north and the south and to use development aid and partnerships with southern countries so that migrants have no desire to come to an El Dorado that does not exist.

Madam President, I of course fully appreciate that Greece cannot deal with the situation alone. That is what I was trying to explain. I had the opportunity to visit the island of Samos in Greece where I saw the very difficult situation at first hand, and I also visited the island of Lampedusa, where I saw just how complicated the problems were. It is by acting together in solidarity, supporting Greece, a Member of the European Union, as much as possible, that we will be able to respond. However, for these responses to be substantive, they must be taken into account across all EU policies. I of course recognise the difficulty facing Greece. It is as if I were Greek.

 I voted for this report, which makes two noteworthy improvements to the coordination of social security systems within the European Union. The first is the clarification concerning access to unemployment benefits, enabling self-employed frontier workers to receive unemployment benefits in the country in which they have been working if they are resident in another Member State where there is no unemployment benefit system. The second is the introduction of the ‘home base’ concept for aircrew members (pilots, air hostesses, etc.), which will put an end to the social dumping that low-cost airlines practise against their personnel and thus guarantee fair social security for all aircrew personnel. As a native of a very ‘cross-border’ region, I fully support any initiative that strengthens the mobility of European citizens within the European Union, so that they can travel, move and work throughout the EU without administrative barriers.

Given their situation, their characteristics, their geographical distance, the structural weaknesses of their economies and their dependence on the outside world, etc., the outermost regions (ORs) of the European Union should be granted special treatment under the European Union’s cohesion policy, so that their unique features are adequately considered and protected. At a time when we are negotiating the new EU budget programming with the EU institutions, our Parliament has strongly objected to the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for ORs by nearly half, pointing out that these regions should receive special treatment. In this resolution, which I supported, we also insist that the specific characteristics of the ORs are taken into account in all European Union policies: fisheries and maritime policy, transport, the environment, etc. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Cancelled flights, lost baggage, delays, overbooking, etc. are all dysfunctions that are currently poorly addressed by the regulations in force. What was needed, therefore, was a new framework and new instruments to guarantee air passengers’ rights in all circumstances. That has now been achieved through this resolution, which, above all, provides greater transparency both in the information given when flights are delayed or cancelled and also in the prices that airlines advertise. Together with this need for transparency, there was also a need to improve the assistance given to passengers. Accordingly, this resolution states that passengers in difficulty should be able to talk directly to contact personnel who can provide immediate solutions and answers. In addition, the report considers that, if luggage is delayed by more than six hours, compensation should be offered that is proportionate to passengers’ needs so that they have the items they need while waiting for their luggage to arrive. Lastly, the resolution stresses that persons with reduced mobility should be given easier access to aircraft. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

In the negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in securing a number of key points: the explicit reference to regional protection programmes, especially the visibility of North Africa, the addition of ‘survivors of violence and/or torture’ to the vulnerable persons category and a reference to refugees from Iraq. I therefore voted in favour of this agreement at second reading. In addition, the negotiations on this text, aimed at amending the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund in the light of the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme, have been going on for nearly two years. We cannot allow this situation to continue when there are thousands of refugees who could benefit from this programme. Indeed, resettlement is the only viable and safe solution as these people are often in an extremely vulnerable situation. The European Union must step up its resettlement efforts in order to protect refugees and maximise the impact of resettlement by focusing, where possible, on those most in need, in accordance with the common priorities established at EU level.

 I voted against the Vaughan report on the draft budget for the European Parliament for the financial year 2013. I do fully support the measures and guidelines contained in this report, such as freezing our Parliament’s budget in real terms, freezing Members’ allowances, the cuts made in the budget relating to travel, the various savings that have been made, etc. However, this report contains three provisions/paragraphs that are clearly anti-Strasbourg. That is why I voted against it. The debate and attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament are coming up more and more often and I am very aware of that. Of course, for a long time, it was a question of symbolism; but today, and above all, it is a legal and political matter. I remain firmly committed to this ongoing fight to keep the European Parliament’s seat in our beautiful European capital. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The report that we have adopted by a very large majority this week aims to list the obstacles to European citizenship that still exist and persist (with regard to free movement, recognition of qualifications and non-discrimination, for example) and to firmly ask Member States to remove these difficulties. Beyond that, citizenship should be the European Union’s number one priority as, without European citizens, there would be no Europe and we could not construct Europe, especially in the context of the economic crisis, the crisis of values that we are facing today. There is currently only a slight sense of European citizenship. Yet, this lack of ‘European sentiment’, this lack of involvement from citizens in the European Union and the EU’s lack of transparency for European citizens are Europe’s greatest flaws. What European citizens are missing is the feeling of belonging to a European community and this is vital for the European Union. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 This week, our Parliament approved the setting up of a special parliamentary committee on organised crime, corruption and money laundering and I welcome it. I am convinced that this committee will provide an effective tool in analysing and evaluating these complex transnational phenomena, in preventing them and, most particularly, in combating them. This committee will be able to establish contacts, make visits, hold hearings, act with civil society and grassroots actors who are fighting on a daily basis against these scourges and, consequently, will be able to recommend measures to enable the European Union to combat these threats.

 Language difficulties, lack of understanding of neighbouring judicial systems, infrequent contacts and exchanges between institutions: these are all obstacles to the construction of a European judicial area. The challenges of judicial training at the level of the European Union are therefore considerable as there can be no construction of a European judicial area if we do not provide appropriate training for those who are the actors within it. Therefore, we must really take this issue in hand and make considerable efforts in relation to judicial training, not only of judges, but also of all other legal practitioners: lawyers, notaries, ombudsmen … in other words, all legal practitioners. There is a clear need today to build a European judicial culture and to do everything in our power to achieve this. We must promote contacts, exchanges and, in particular, I would like to point out the importance of setting up a genuine ‘Erasmus for judges’. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The European Union is the world’s principal consumer of chocolate, 70% of global cocoa production is cultivated in West Africa and approximately 18 million children throughout the world are estimated to work on cocoa plantations. The European Union cannot turn a blind eye to this utterly unacceptable situation which is dreadful in human terms. These children work in extremely dangerous conditions, they are frequently exposed to pesticides, and many are victims of human trafficking. I therefore strongly voted in favour of the annex to this resolution, which follows Parliament’s consent to the renewal of the International Cocoa Agreement in terms of production and commerce. This resolution is aimed at focusing on the issue of child labour in cocoa plantations and, in particular, it strongly condemns the use of child labour (and unacceptable types of work) in the growing and harvesting of cocoa beans.

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on addressing the European Union’s diabetes epidemic, which calls on the Commission to develop and implement a targeted European strategy on diabetes prevention, diagnosis, education and research, and calls on the Member States to implement national diabetes programmes, focusing on prevention. Diabetes affects almost 10% of Europe’s population and this figure is expected to increase by 16.6% by 2030. It is therefore necessary for the EU to adopt a European strategy to complement the national efforts in order to provide ongoing financial support for research and encourage early diagnosis of the disease.Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, José Manuel, I do not know if I should make a speech: I fully support yours! I do not need to repeat it but I will just echo a few comments that you made and look at them in more detail, although I feel that you covered everything. The only thing that has not been said is that with EUR 1.1 billion or EUR 1.13 billion, the budget that we have today, we can continue our policies; but below EUR 1 billion, we cannot do anything. I think that the Commission and Parliament have to stand firm in relation to what is happening now in the Council. As you said, on the one hand, there are those who want a long-term budget that can meet the challenges ahead: because the European budget is an investment budget and not a budget of expenditure; because we need it to relaunch growth and job creation and, in my opinion, no Head of State or Government is opposed to that. Then there are those who want a reduced budget to make short-term savings. In these conditions, do we really need a summit this afternoon? We need to meet to discuss, but not to reduce, the budget. The European Parliament’s position is clear, however; this position is now that of the majority in Europe and 517 Members of this Parliament voted for a multiannual financial framework (MFF) that is realistic and meets our ambitions. Sixteen Heads of Government are following this line and they met last week, as you said. If I were to give them one piece of advice, I would say: ‘be united at the Council and stand firm when it comes to defending our common budget’. At the risk of repeating myself, those who see only a free trade area and a single market in Europe are lying to themselves and they are lying to their citizens. The European Union is, above all, a Community of values, including that of solidarity. Did you know that, through the European Stability Mechanism, the Estonians and the Slovakians are helping to fund pensions in Greece, which are even higher than their own? I wanted to highlight this – and it is not said often enough – because these countries believe in the added value of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, my group is convinced that the European Union needs a sound, solid, responsible budget because, with the crisis, it is the only way for certain Member States to make investments. In the Baltic countries, for example, a Prime Minister told me last week that without funding from Europe, railway lines will continue to be connected to Moscow, and not to Europe. That is not what European integration means. However, like us, the Baltic countries need these connections to Europe. To achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, we will need more than a trillion euros worth of investment in infrastructure networks. Yes, most of these investments will be private, but without European support, without cofinancing on our part, these projects will not see the light of day because of a lack of start-up capital. Let us take another example: we decided to invest nearly EUR 270 billion so that all European households and all our businesses benefit from broadband between now and 2020. However, if we had waited for private investment alone to achieve this, we would only have reached EUR 50 billion. That would mean no broadband for Europe as we would be EUR 220 billion short. These investments are necessary for our businesses, however. They create jobs, they stimulate the economy, and they contribute to our competitiveness. The only way to get out of this economic crisis is to develop through investment. Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crossroads. Either we learn the lessons of these last 60 years and we work together to relaunch Europe around peace, solidarity and competitiveness, or we trap ourselves in selfish, nationalist positions and founder together.  The 16 Member States plus Croatia who met last week in the European Parliament demonstrated that there is a core of Member States who want to move forward together. We, in the European Parliament, are going to defend our position on the budget. We will defend the European aid programme for the poor, which you mentioned. The proposal to reduce this programme by EUR 400 million is unacceptable. We will not allow this programme to be touched, even if we have to make an effort on all the other budget lines. It is out of the question to sacrifice aid to our poorest citizens, especially since their number will grow with the crisis. We have to fulfil this responsibility in order to support the NGOs that look after these people voluntarily. Removing this funding from the budget is not really a sign of solidarity; it is exactly the opposite. I am counting on this Parliament: we must not allow this position to be attacked. We will defend the Europe in which we believe: not a sum of countries that pick and choose from the menu of common policies, but a real union of 27 that is united, responsible and prosperous. We are at a crossroads. It is our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand firm if things do not move in the right direction, and it is also our duty to go beyond the selfish, national positions in our various countries to pave the way for the Europe of the future.

Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am, by nature, an optimistic person. My optimism is realistic, however. It is based on concrete elements, on facts and accomplishments, and on experience of everything we have achieved in the past 60 years, which, in the end, is just a start. The Nobel Prize awarded to the European Union is recognition of what we have built together over 60 years. However, it is also encouragement to go further, and I believe in Europe. I believe in the Community method. I believe in the added value that the European Union offers through its common policies. I also believe, however, in the European investment that allows our budget to inject some EUR 100 billion into our economies every year, and it is by no means enough. Europe needs these ambitious policies, policies that are going to help us to restore growth, but to implement them, we need an ambitious budget. I think that the debate here has clearly demonstrated that. I therefore appeal to everyone to face up to their responsibilities. We need a financial framework that matches our ambitions and, above all, we need an agreement at the end of the year if we want to appear credible to the outside world, Mr President. Last week’s European Council took a further step towards achieving our economic union. Our crisis is an economic crisis, but our mistake has been to fail to meet our commitments and comply with the rules that we set ourselves. In recent months, we have faced up to our responsibilities here, in this Parliament, and we have introduced the necessary instruments. The ‘economic governance’ package now has force of law but it has to be applied. The same goes for the ‘two-pack’ that we are discussing today. I think that we are going to conclude that very soon. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the lessons of this crisis is that we cannot exclude certain sectors, such as the banking sector, from our common laws. My group is aware of that, which is why we support the Council’s proposal to establish a European bank supervisor. In our economy, everything is connected. The slightest failure, the collapse of a single bank, affects the entire system. The banks may think that they are too big to fail, but no bank is too small to be supervised. We are convinced of this: our citizens, our businesses and the banks themselves need to have confidence in our financial system. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will make every effort to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from this crisis and that our European Union is reinforced because we believe that Europe is the solution. For some 20 years, the single market has been our success, but for that success to last, we must complete it and finish our work. We must force the Heads of State or Government to quickly fill in the gaps in the single market. I am thinking, in particular, about the establishment of the digital single market. If we do not do this, we will lose a turnover of EUR 1 billion every year. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crossroads. Some people want to do away with some of the European Union’s competences and reduce Europe to an economic free trade area. Europe is much more than that, however. Since the signature of the Treaty of Rome by our founding fathers, the European project has been synonymous with peace and prosperity. That has now been rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize. For 60 years, Europe has set an example in the world. Our role tomorrow is to strengthen the social market economy, increase our solidarity, continue to defend human rights and, above all, spread our values throughout Europe and beyond. President-in-Office of the Council, as I have said often here in this House, in times of crisis we need to take decisions. When we take decisions, it is inevitable that we will make some mistakes, but the worst thing to do in a crisis is to wait for too long. If we wait for too long, we will eventually cost our fellow citizens billions of euros. That is my appeal to you, and I hope that we will see a very good European budget before the end of the year. That will be proof of our commitment for the outside world and the markets. I wish you the very best of luck; I hope that you have the determination to reach your goal and bring us a nice Christmas present at our December part-session. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank José Manuel Barroso for his address, his speech, his analysis and his realism. We are back after summer break and, as is the case each year, we have two things to do: take stock of the past twelve months and discuss the future of the European Union. I think we are heading in the right direction now. What I mean is that we need to continue along the road towards greater European integration We also need more specific reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking about the crisis for three years now. We know that we were living beyond our means for too long, we know that we need greater discipline and a return to balanced budgets. Only then will we be able to invest in our future generations. We know the ways out of the crisis. In economic terms, what we have done over the last three years, we have done too slowly, and that has cost us billions. As for the economic governance package, the Euro Plus Pact, the European Semester, the Single Market Act, and in some sectors, for example, the banks, the need for European solutions is evident. Banks are no longer national, but transnational. A failing bank can bring down the entire banking system. This is why my group supports your proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism in the banking sector. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that our solutions are positive and we have examples to back this up. Although, I have not written it down on my sheet here, you have made me realise that there are also some positive examples. I think that the governments that have made the most reforms in Europe also belong to our political family. I am thinking about our friend Mr Dombrovskis. Although his is a small country deep in crisis, he got it out of crisis and there is now meaningful growth. Here too, as I see it, is an example, and he did it without having to rely too much on European solidarity. In his speeches, he stressed that in this deep crisis the only money he had to invest, was money he received from the EU budget. I think this needs to be given some thought because, unlike some, we realised how serious the situation was. We know that our economies are in bad shape and that the only way to get them better is a complete cure. To kick start this, we need a change of habits. We need large-scale rather than small-scale reforms. Yes, it is hard, but what choice do we have? For these reforms to succeed, we must also promote competitiveness and growth. My group supports those governments that are going down this route. I would also like to make another point. European solidarity should not be confused with charity. That is why I support the European Central Bank’s proposal to buy bonds because any State that benefits from this solidarity must act responsibly. Without a programme of reforms offering credible proposals, a State cannot receive this aid. This is the right approach. It is a European approach and, by bolstering States in difficulty, it is Europe, as a whole, that we are strengthening. Ladies and gentlemen, I will say it again, 20 years after it was introduced, we have still not completed the single market. Mr Barroso, I am appealing to you again. We must, as a matter of urgency, develop an action plan with precise deadlines to finish the job we started. The rules on the single market should be simple, consistently applied and implemented as a single package. For example, because of red tape, 23 million European SMEs still have no access to all 27 markets. Let me tell you that one job created in each of these 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises – if you tot it up - is a significant number. That is why my group has called for a reduction in red tape by 2015. At least 50% less paper: think of the trees saved for the environment. By doing this, we are giving European companies the chance to create jobs. The Commission must play a full part and have no hesitation in enforcing the law. Publish lists of States that have still not implemented the directives and force them to do so. Use your powers! Governments are frequently challenging us Europeans. Everything is always our fault. Let them, then, take some responsibility too. I call on you, Mr President, to define new, concrete fields in which the European institutions should intervene. I am convinced that there is a very simple remedy for the current crisis: it is more Europe, yet more Europe and more Europe again. What we need is fiscal and social harmonisation. Our joint actions and policies are successful. Let me give you one example that will surely surprise you: agricultural policy. This truly is a joint policy which has ensured food security – as you mentioned – during periods of significant fluctuations. It has also got entire regions out of poverty. This policy must remain European. Above all, we must not do what many are now calling for and renationalise it. That would be a disaster. This is a European policy that been successful and must remain European. To take another example, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment. No country can solve this problem on its own. Even if this comes under national jurisdiction, again, it is time to find a European solution. Again, I am thinking about this extra job in each of the 23 million SMEs. It might make you all smile, but not me: twenty-three million extra jobs with a European policy for youth employment; that should make you think. Ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Mr President, we are in the throes of an unprecedented storm. There are those in Europe and elsewhere, who would be only too pleased to see the euro collapse. Personally, I do not want to give them that pleasure and nor do you, José Manuel. Besides, why do the credit rating agencies prefer to attack the euro, rather than judge the country they know best where their head office is? They are not making the same analyses. I know why but, all the same, it is not right. We must face this storm, not by plastering up the cracks, but by strengthening our foundations. We must not repeat past mistakes. Creating an economic union without an accompanying political union is inconceivable. Our credibility is at stake. Mr President, let us show some European ambition. Europe makes decisions that affect 500 million Europeans. These decisions should be taken under democratic control, by the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage. The place of democratic legitimacy is here in Parliament, and I thank President Schulz for having refocused matters. We are elected democratically. I therefore think we should be recognised democratically. The so-called ‘four presidents’’ proposal aiming at real economic and monetary union is ambitious but it needs to be more so and Parliament should also be involved in this. Concentrating only on economic reforms is the wrong way to go because the economic crisis has become a political crisis, a crisis of confidence – as you rightly pointed out at the end. Now, I agree on a Treaty change in the medium and long term, but this is not the solution we need in the immediate future. Because I am French, all we need is for some Rules of Procedure to be applied to fiscal and social policies, and to be included in the Treaty when we have time to think. Now is the time for action. The latest Eurobarometer struck me. It reveals that a majority of Europeans think that Europe is indeed a good thing. But in many Member States, more and more of our citizens do not feel European. It is our duty - as you said - to explain the added value, but it is also the duty of all national leaders. For me, a good, responsible politician is like a good doctor. Both have to explain things, both have to tell the truth, both have to convince you, even if you do not want to hear it. We need to discuss the next steps of our integration with this reality in mind. Ladies and gentlemen, I am calling for more Europe, not more power for the sake of having power. We must build a Europe that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. This is why we want the 2014-2020 EU budget to have a credible, solid and ambitious framework, as it has been prepared by the Commission and Parliament. Here too, the Heads of State or Government are being held to political account and it will show our citizens whether or not we want more Europe. The European budget is not a budget of spending, but a budget of investing. It is a forward-looking budget, a budget for growth. Let us be serious and ambitious. I call on all those responsible to find a solution before the end of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, judges will today rule on the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Here in Parliament, we champion democratic control at European level. We also need to have the courage to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg when we think that our rights are not being respected. We must go before the Court frequently, as others do, and I am sure that will also strengthen Parliament. This is also why we need a real political Europe. A Europe where Parliament is the only direct representative of the citizens of Europe. If we do not do this, we will fail. Political union is legitimacy, it is more democratic control, more citizen participation. This is the Europe that I believe in. These are the values that our group supports. (Applause) Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Cyprus is taking over the Council presidency at a decisive moment for Europe. I said here, only yesterday in fact, that the European Council has held 30 meetings on the economic crisis and it is not over yet. Thirty meetings and only last week did we see the start of an action plan. That is why I am calling this morning on the new Presidency to show courage and determination. I hope that this Presidency will convince its 26 partners to opt for an integrated Europe, a political Europe and, at last, a united and therefore sovereign Europe. The economic crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge relates to the competitiveness of our economy and to unemployment, which is breaking records with an average rate of 11%. The opportunity is to do what the countries in the euro area should have done at the outset, in other words implement a common economic policy, a policy of balanced budgets and, above all, a long-term investment policy. President Christofias, although you and I are from radically opposed political parties, my group supports the priorities of your Presidency. In particular, I heard you use an expression that is very important to me: the Community method. In that respect, I know that I can count on you. Like you, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants the European Union to be more effective, more relevant and more efficient and to experience renewed growth. On that basis, we need to act. We need to take advantage of the 20th anniversary of the single market in the autumn to complete, at last, the work that began under Jacques Delors and implement the Single Market Act as quickly as possible. We need to apply the Services Directive in full. We need to create a genuine digital single market. We also need to reduce the burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. All of these measures will create growth and will thus create jobs. These are the measures that I am asking you, Mr President, to take along with this Parliament and in close cooperation with the Commission. There is another key aspect of your Presidency: the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. My group truly hopes that progress is made in this regard during the next six months, in the knowledge that the European budget is an investment budget, a growth budget and an employment budget. We need investment in all 27 Member States in infrastructure, investment in all 27 Member States in energy networks and in education, research and innovation, cohesion policies and food security; you spoke about food aid for the most deprived, I believe, and you also have my support in that regard. That is a credible and tangible response to the crisis, too. The Cypriot Presidency will find in the European Parliament an active and committed participant when it comes to the financial perspective, as long as the proposed budget is large enough and tailored to our needs. We will be keeping an eye on that, but we will help you to reach the end of the year with a Christmas package for this budget for the multiannual financial framework. Now, Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen – do not laugh, Mr Barroso, the package will be good, you will see – I would like to talk about another issue before you here this morning and that is the worrying political situation that has prevailed for a number of days in one of our Member States, Romania. Yesterday the Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, expressed grave concern. I quote: ‘I am seriously concerned about recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania. For me, a well-functioning, independent judicial system is a precondition for mutual trust in the European area of justice’. My group shares the Commission’s concerns and last week I, myself, expressed my concerns about the current state of democracy in Romania. This morning, I ask the Commission very sincerely to continue to monitor this issue as it has monitored others, in spite of the summer break. It is important for us to make progress over the next six months on various issues that are on the table and, President Christofias, we are counting on you. There are a lot of good things that you can do. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the thirtieth European Council dedicated to the crisis. Although, in comparison to previous meetings, we are closer to reaching the desired solution, the road map towards European political integration is still not forthcoming. Of course, this time, substantial progress has been achieved. Following the country-specific economic recommendations proposed by the Commission, the document presented by Mr Van Rompuy is a step in the right direction, as it finally refers to political Europe as the ultimate aim. He mentions a preparation period spread over 10 years. Yet, each of us knows that Europe will not survive between now and 2022 without budgetary, fiscal and social integration. I often wonder what political development the Twenty-Seven will judge sufficiently serious in order to consent to shared sovereignty. I wonder what graver problems are necessary, other than unemployment, the difficulties experienced by our companies, the prohibitive interest rates that our Member States must pay, in order to prove that a single currency must include a common economic policy. Having said that, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is satisfied with the advances contained in the Growth and Employment Pact, even though this contains some of the long-standing proposals already put forward by this Parliament and the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you must continue, together with Parliament, to put whatever is needed on the table, because when the Heads of State or Government come together, they are unable to find a solution. For each of them, it is a question of survival in their own countries. Therefore, we need Parliament, together with the Commission and Mr Van Rompuy, to come forward with, and put on the table, concrete proposals so that when governments find themselves strangled by the markets and suchlike, they may have a solution, as was the case with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’. My group supports the system of banking supervision, the proposal for a European guarantee and the European banking union project. Our fellow citizens must know that their savings are protected at all levels and that the instruments used to guarantee them are going in the right direction. Here too, we must strengthen protection. We need to guarantee the savings deposits of people who have worked all their lives, and you know we have problems with this issue at the moment. What now remains is the implementation of the instruments. That is why I again call upon the Commission, the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure this happens. The PPE Group also supports the EUR 10 billion increase in capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Indeed, we must ensure that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can finance their projects, keep their employees, in the first instance and, above all, be able to hire new staff. Although the provisions on the single market remain insufficient, project bonds, which were decided upon last Friday, are a step in the right direction. I welcome this move, insofar as it does not consist of supplementary funds that no longer exist, but rather better use of existing European funds. I would like to highlight here that last month, the Latvian Prime Minister once again came to speak to our group in order to tell us that, faced with the imperative of budgetary cuts that were being forced upon him, he has only been able to restart his country’s economy thanks to European funds. This is an example that must be repeated. The Latvian Prime Minister did it and he informed his citizens. Thanks to European solidarity, combined with the courage of its leaders, this country has restored growth and employment. Just because it is a small country does not mean that we cannot emulate this example. We do not talk enough about these amazing examples for Europe. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we see that the solution to the majority of our problems lies in having more Europe. It is for that reason that my group places so much importance on the next multiannual financial framework, which is presently under discussion, as it will allow us to continue to finance our common policies. These funds constitute the base of European solidarity and are an essential instrument for growth and employment. In the 1950s, European integration was necessary to guarantee peace and security in our continent. Today, this same integration is essential in order to protect our European social model which we have patiently constructed. It is essential in order to defend our common interests in international trade. It is essential for the promotion of our values and our humanist ideals, human rights, human dignity, transparency and the rule of law. That is why I repeat my call for a politically integrated Europe, not an intergovernmental Europe, as was supported by the Council in the Schengen case, or again last week concerning the issue of patents. For as long as the Community method is not our governance rule, nor that of the Council, Europe will lose ground. I know you have a difficult job, Mr Van Rompuy, but fear not! Make proposals with us, with Parliament and the Commission, to these Heads of State or Government who, as I said, do not have the capacity for reflection as they are obligated to manage their very difficult issues on a daily basis in each of their respective countries. We need a much more integrated Europe. We must compare what works, the countries that cope – because there are some – and apply their example to those that work less well. There you have what I want us to put on the table, Mr Barroso, during the next two months. We will reflect further on this during the holidays and then we will make proposals in September, if the markets allow us to do so. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, allow me to ask a question as I, like you all, am very worried. If you look at the statistics, they show that from September onwards, we will increasingly see a situation in which some countries will have made unswerving efforts over a period of several years, and other countries will not have made such efforts. These countries will refuse to continue and will no longer be able to pay for solidarity because things are going badly for them. Therefore, in the Democrat groups, we must also, from August onwards, discuss the formulation of real proposals. For we cannot spend money that we do not have. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that the Member States tackled the real problems and had the courage to answer the real questions. It is time for the European Council to finally adopt tough measures on 28 and 29 June, rather than settle for fall-back mechanisms that are immediately overtaken by events. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), these real questions in actual fact boil down to one: are we ready to make the necessary political leap to make the European Union and the euro area work? This is a question that could not be asked two years ago. Are we both clear-headed and politically courageous enough to defend and organise shared political sovereignty, or are we going to allow our laws, our policies, our societal choices to be dictated by the financial markets and banks, as we have been doing for two years now, lurching from one crisis Council to the next? (Applause)
 We must assume our responsibilities once and for all. What we want is a European Union with a social and fiscal model, and we need to show this. This is a difficult time and, in times of crisis, we move forwards and not backwards. We have to face reality and stop deluding ourselves. The reality is that no country in Europe can tackle global challenges, whether economic, social, demographic, military or political, single-handedly. We see this every day. Each Member State says, ‘I do not need Europe, I do not need Europe,’ and, the next day, it asks for help. Members of the Council, the reality is that, over the last 60 years, we have achieved peace and prosperity and that this has been possible thanks to a method, the Community method. I believe deeply in this method, just as I am convinced that Europe is the solution and not the problem. So, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 and 29 June, notwithstanding such important issues as economic governance, the credibility of the euro, and financial perspectives, the PPE Group will, first and foremost, call on the Member States to make a choice, a major choice that will determine the rest: do you want to ensure a future for Europeans and to focus on what is really important, which is to ensure strong political integration through the Community method? Or do you prefer to keep on pretending that you have economic sovereignty only to find, the day after each summit, the day after each meeting of Finance Ministers, that the decisions taken are inadequate and untimely and that we are heading for disaster? Do you prefer, as you did on 7 June in relation to Schengen, to withdraw to your borders and fall back on your intergovernmental arrangements? If you go for the first option, Parliament will be happy to work with you to find lasting solutions to the problems of our fellow citizens. However, if the Council stubbornly refuses to agree on the main issues, we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel in the short term. Those are my requests to the Council. I would also like to request that the President of Parliament be finally given the opportunity to debate with the Heads of State or Government all the subjects that will affect the future of Europeans. The President of the Commission has his place in the Council, as does the President of the Central Bank. Is the democratically elected President not as worthy as the President of the Central Bank? (Applause)
 The person who represents 500 million Europeans, presides over the only institution elected by universal suffrage, and who leads the institution that legislates with the Council is asked to leave the Chamber after he has given his presentation. What democracy, what transparency can we demonstrate to the outside world? European integration cannot be achieved without the democratic legitimacy embodied by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, I will end by saying – and I know that you repeat things time and again, as we do, in this Chamber – that we need to continue to make recommendations. We need to continue to table new proposals on social and fiscal union and we must not be afraid to publicise them. Go ahead – Parliament is with you. We are the driving force behind the proposals, and the Council needs us in the difficult crisis situation in which it finds itself. It needs to find solutions and we need to put them on the table, even more so than we have done so far. You can count on us. I would also like you to go further and publish, every three months, an up-to-date table of the economic and social measures on the internal market taken by each of our governments, both on the right and on the left. Europeans need to know which Member States are making an effort to get their public finances back in shape and to promote growth and jobs and are not just talking about doing so. All these proposals need to be continued. We are going to haul Europe out of the crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, what the PPE Group wants is honesty with regard to our fellow citizens and, above all, a great deal of political courage. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 I think I have always had the courage to say what I think and I have had it all my life. It is the only thing I inherited from my father, who told me, ‘Take care never to be taken hostage,’ and whenever I was taken hostage, it never lasted more than two days, I assure you, Mr Cohn-Bendit. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I will try to stay calm, even though I am absolutely seething. Minister, we had already been provoked, and you have provoked us even further this morning. However, I will stay calm. (Applause)
 By deciding unanimously, against the opinion of the European Commission, to alter the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the interior ministers have made a decision that is completely unacceptable to the Group of the European People’s Party. I would like to thank Ms Malmström for the courage she showed right to the end. She did not bend under pressure from the Council. (Applause)
 Ms Malmström, we will need the Commission over the next few weeks, as the debates will be tough. Minister, I am surprised that you did not introduce visas at the same: you would have protected our 500 million consumers even more. (Applause)
 By proposing this initiative, you have broken the bond of trust with this Parliament: this initiative has broken the fundamental principle of the community method in a very dangerous way and, as you know, I am very attached to that principle. You have attacked it and you will find us blocking your way. This principle prevents the larger Member States from imposing their will on the smaller States. It ensures that Europe’s general interest comes before national interests. You have broken that, my friend. The European Parliament and Commission are the guardians of this community method, and we have no intention of giving up on it. Last Thursday, I asked the Presidency of the Council, in the person of Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is a former member of the European Parliament herself, to appear before this Parliament to explain her position. She telephoned me yesterday evening, and I think she ought to have been here this morning, because the community method is important and she knows what she is talking about. The Danish Presidency does not have enough respect for Europe’s 500 million citizens to even bother to tell them why it has denied its Members of Parliament the right of codecision on a subject as important as freedom of movement. As far as I am concerned, since the evening of 7 June, the Danish Presidency is over. Between now and midnight on 30 June, we will address either the Council or the incoming Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus. You should know that I had to think long and hard before saying that, but you have broken the community method. That is something that must not be done. (Applause)
 At a time when the economic and social crisis we are going through calls for a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and respect from everyone and from all our national and European leaders, you have broken that respect. By withdrawing their trust in Parliament, the Member States are going in the opposite direction to the one that will allow us to come out of the crisis from the top down: in other words, via political integration between us. The solution to our problems is not to withdraw behind our borders; quite the opposite: the solution is shared sovereignty and joint management, in a spirit of mutual trust and of respect for the thing we hold most dear: our freedoms. Our group asks the Council to reverse its decision. Only by doing this will it be able to come back to this European Parliament. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are celebrating Europe. This celebration on 9 May is particularly significant at a delicate time for European integration in economic terms, but also in political terms. We often forget the progress our countries have made since signing Robert Schuman’s declaration, yet never in our history have we known such an area of peace and prosperity in spite of the current crisis. We Europeans have paid a high price to understand that there is no difference between our neighbours and ourselves. We know at last the value of tolerance, of dialogue, of solidarity, which take precedence over individualism. Ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism and the lure of populism require our attention. Left-wing populism has no more place in Europe than right-wing populism. I urge all the mainstream political parties to remember that they have nothing to gain and everything to lose if extremism becomes commonplace. Intellectual shortcuts and easy solutions are mere demagogy. They simply entertain the false hopes of our citizens, which quickly come to nothing. How, then, in this context, can we reduce Europe’s democratic deficit? As I said, Europe is experiencing a difficult period and the decisions that will be made over the coming months will determine the stability of our economies and the social cohesion of our countries. The debt crisis and the recent attacks on the markets against our currency have at least had the merit of making us aware of the deterioration of public finances that has been going on in several European countries for decades. We have shown, in Parliament, with the ‘six-pack’, with the fiscal treaty, and soon with the ‘two-pack’ as well, that Europe has demonstrated the courage to take itself to task and reverse this trend. However, our efforts have only just begun and we must under no circumstances relax them. I must say, what worries me most is this current political debate between growth and cleaning up national finances. Indeed, behind the caricatures, it is not that there are those in Europe who are in favour of good management and those who are in favour of growth, simply because they are two sides of the same coin, as I have often said here in this Chamber. The reality is that we cannot separate deficit reduction and growth, and you have said so yourself. There will be no sustainable growth unless we reduce our debts and this reduction will come about all the more quickly with strong growth. The reality is that growth-stimulating measures cannot be synonymous with additional spending. We no longer have the resources. The reality is that, as long as the most spendthrift countries refuse to lead debt-reduction policies, the countries that are themselves making an effort towards sound management will no longer be able to show solidarity. Ladies and gentlemen, confidence is what will come from investment and growth. I am not talking about artificial growth. There is only one way to achieve this: enhancing the competitiveness of our economies in the context of globalisation. Europe has a promising future so long as we all assume our responsibilities and we implement the decisions that have already been adopted. We know very well what is needed: completing the single market, investing in research and development to continue to play the leading role among 21st century economies, and reducing administrative burdens to unlock the potential of our SMEs and our companies. It is in this way, and by cleaning up our public finances, that we will ensure growth and that we will create jobs for the future. Robert Schuman’s declaration paved a new way for Europeans. Now more than ever, we are bound together. We are united, responsible for one another, and this involves budgetary convergence, which is under way, but also fiscal and social convergence. Yet this solidarity can only work if each of us makes efforts and is ready to combine cleaning up public finances with sustainable growth. You know that Robert Schuman’s declaration brought us a project for peace, which has been a success. Let us say it too. However, I should like to finish with these words: solidarity, responsibility, enthusiasm, conviction and let us have a project for the future, for growth and for employment. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of European fiscal discipline, we have achieved a lot in a short space of time. What we did was necessary, because in 2008 and last autumn, we were on the brink of disaster and we almost lost everything: the euro, our financial system, but, above all, our credibility in the world and our social model. We now have the instruments for greater discipline. We needed to do all of this so that Europe could regain its credibility. We needed to do all of this to create the conditions for a return to growth. Growth which, being the only way to get us out of crisis, must be at the heart of our debates, starting with this afternoon’s. We cannot achieve growth by passing laws, but what we can do is create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth. How so? Firstly, by focusing on European policies for growth and employment and putting others on hold. This means acting quickly to conduct a qualitative audit of European public expenditure so that we can make informed decisions. The EU budget must be one of the key instruments for kick-starting the European economy. Therefore, having done it with fiscal discipline, I propose a joint initiative committing us to growth, an initiative that would make the EU budget a reserve for investment for all of us. The growth principle needs to be the equivalent of the principle of subsidiarity. This principle would mean that each proposal, each EU policy would, in future, have to demonstrate how it contributes to growth. No potential for growth, no money. That should be our rule for the next two years. This principle would mean that we could, for example, examine the issue of trade agreements. Are we gaining market shares or are we losing them? Are we gaining jobs or are we losing them? Another point close to my heart, as you know, is the single market. Twenty years after its launch, as I have already said and I will go on saying, we have a duty to achieve it fully. Our 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises need it, because unlike the major players, they cannot adapt to the competitiveness gaps that still exist today. We therefore have to do it for our SMEs, the very ones who, over the past decade, have created 85% of new jobs. Business leaders are now being accused of being rich. Did you know that, like me, these bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises earn at most just EUR 1 000 to 1 200 and are looking for contracts that will guarantee employment to the workers of their SMEs. Here, too, Mr Barroso, we need to support them so that the banks offer finance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Instead, they are dropping them, and that is not right. We need to establish a more effective support. We need to adopt a much stricter approach in order to maintain support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These are jobs that exist and we do not want to lose them. On the completion of the single market, let me add another point: we need to reduce paperwork and red tape which, alone, costs our economy nearly EUR 40 billion. We need to simplify matters in order to move on. Ladies and gentlemen, the growth we need to kick-start our economy is not the growth of the future. What we need, right now, is to rapidly increase the added value that these companies bring. What we need is productivity gains in public services. What we need is an employment policy adapted to the new situation and I welcome the proposals adopted by the Commission this morning in this regard. The markets have already shown renewed confidence in the Union. This confidence will remain thanks to the unprecedented discipline and solidarity of Europeans. Such solidarity was inconceivable just two years ago. I also welcome the Commission’s plan for putting the Greek economy and its public finances back on a sustainable path and for guaranteeing financial stability in that country and in the euro area as a whole. It is now up to our Greek friends, whose courage I commend, to stay the course, before and after the upcoming elections. Ladies and gentlemen, we must make the most of this new impetus to step up a gear and urgently refocus the EU’s action and budget on real growth. I would like to thank the Commission – José Manuel and his team – for their work, which is no mean feat, and I also call on the Member States to move up a gear as they are the ones with deficits. It is now time for them to move back up into top gear to restore growth and jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

Blue-card answer.

 I will do what my friend, Georges Marchais, used to do. I did not understand the question but I will give you an answer anyway. Anyhow, my dear friend, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is responsible for what is happening in the various countries as we shoulder our responsibility. If we have made mistakes, then we need to accept where we went wrong. That is the first point. As for the second, I do not understand what you are saying about my group. We voted for the ‘six-pack’, that was the first point. We are currently preparing the ‘two-pack’, and I do hope it will be based on the growth and employment model favoured by you. As I way saying … I do not really know what you were driving at … I am also a company director working on a voluntary basis to manage my company employing just 160 people. I do not get a penny from it. We have faced difficulties four or five times now and, each time, with the help of my employees, we have managed to get ourselves out of trouble. However, we are not yet out of the crisis and that is why I maintain that it is vital that we keep the jobs we have and create new ones. That is my answer, my dear friend. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, you are aware of what is happening in Argentina as concerns the threat of nationalising YPF, a company in which the Spanish group Repsol is a shareholder. We are calling for a debate with a resolution because we wish to protect European investments in third countries and, more specifically, to react to the unilateral and arbitrary decision taken by the Argentinean authorities. We are calling for this debate to take place tomorrow and for a resolution to be drafted that we can work on and later put to the vote. We do not need to adopt it tomorrow. We can do it on Thursday. That is our group’s request. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your appointment, and I wish you a great deal of courage for the next two and a half years, since we all need good proposals to create jobs in Europe. I think there are two lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The first is putting national and regional finances back on track, and it can wait no longer. The signing of the fiscal treaty, with 25 members, two days ago, shows that this lesson has been learnt by the most far-sighted countries of the EU. The treaty imposes an obligation on its signatories to show good faith, honesty and discipline. However, everyone knows that actually applying a provision is more important than signing it. This is where we are waiting for the Member States, and for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties. Everyone remembers how the Stability Pact was infringed by the largest Member States. Everyone remembers that a certain President of the Commission even called it ‘stupid’. I therefore welcome the fiscal treaty which is, with the ‘six-pack’ and, soon, the ‘two-pack’ as well, a useful instrument. However, I would like to call for vigilance regarding how they are actually applied. The second lesson to learn from the crisis is the emphasis to be placed on a return to sustainable growth and growth that creates jobs. I must say that, in this area, there has been no real progress since the start of the crisis. The Council meeting in January merely contented itself with making recommendations to the Member States, without any coordination or overall plan. As for the Commission, it is working extremely hard, but the many initiatives it is undertaking would be better understood and more effective if they formed part of an overall project, particularly a project for growth and employment. Above all, I am struck by the difficulty and also the slowness with which too many Member States are applying the rules to which they have, nonetheless, made a commitment. On this point, I also expect the Commission to be more vigilant in its efforts to put Member States back on the right path. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is proposing two courses of action, which it will place on an official basis in a public letter to the Council and the Commission. The first area concerns the internal market. At the end of this year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market. However, 20 years on, there are still more than 150 bottlenecks hampering the operation of that market. It is for this reason that I am calling not only for us to ensure that the rules that have been adopted are actually applied, but also for a legislative package to be put forward, together with a precise timetable to enable us to complete the internal market. This is an urgent matter and within in it we can find, as I say every day, at least a small percentage of growth for all the countries, which is very important at this difficult time. The services sector, which is vital for Europe’s economy, constitutes in itself one of the largest blockages. Prices vary within the European Union; they can be up to twice as high for medicines, three times as high for medical treatments, four times as high for certain kinds of insurance and 100 times as high for the same university qualifications. When we know this, it is clear that action can wait no longer. Of course, we cannot do everything at once. It is for this reason that I call upon the Commission to start with a new legislative initiative in 10 sectors of the internal market. The second course of action recommended by the PPE Group concerns the investments needed for growth. I am also proposing, on this point, that in the European budgets for the next few years, a share allocated to investments generating growth and jobs should be protected. Let me be clear: it is not a question of new expenditure or additional budgets, but of channelling funds that are already available towards sustainable investment. Finally, we must provide ourselves with our own resources. It is not widely enough known that one euro invested by the EU can produce, through its multiplier effect, up to EUR 5 in investment. To take the example of energy, in 2010, the EUR 4 billion injected into the sector ended up generating EUR 22 billion in investment. I will finish with this: our fellow citizens, particularly young people, need jobs now. Our economy needs small growth to begin with and guaranteed growth for the future. The budget pact will ensure healthy and honest finances. Mr Barroso, I believe that on this point, you are right. We must combat tax evasion more rigorously. You have quoted the figures, and it is an enormous problem. We must act to create jobs, while the completion of the single market and the protection of the investment budget ought to generate sustainable growth and jobs. Joseph Daul  (PPE

Mr President, I would simply like to know what the reaction of my friend Guy Verhofstadt is, since Mr Sarkozy does not have a representative of the Front national
 in his government. We have a problem regarding the Netherlands, where the government has never condemned anything. That is much more dangerous and much more insidious. The second thing I would like to ask him is this: when Neelie Kroes says that Greece must leave the euro, I have never heard Mr Verhofstadt criticise the suggestion. Please answer these questions.

 Madam President, Vice-President Reding, thank you for being here and thank you, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council for attending this sitting. This afternoon, we are talking about racism and discrimination. These are serious issues, but they are clearly not serious enough in the eyes of the Dutch Prime Minister for him to come and debate them with us. Nevertheless, it is because of a partner in his parliamentary majority that we are forced to hold this debate today. Over and above his empty chair politics, I regret, above all, that the Dutch Prime Minister is refusing to distance himself from a website that is racist, violent and misleading. Indeed, it is wrong, first and foremost, to say that European workers do not contribute to the Dutch economy. Throughout Europe, the economy has benefited from the mobility of workers from Central and Eastern Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, although it is not perfect, the internal market, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of the pillars of Europe and there is absolutely no doubt that Dutch companies have benefited from it over those 20 years, as have companies from other countries, and that they have taken advantage of the Central and Eastern European market. Indeed, since 1993, those companies have invested more than EUR 23 billion in Poland, they are the largest investors in Romania and I congratulate them on that. However, beyond the economy, I ask the following question in particular: what message is the Dutch Prime Minister sending when he refuses to condemn the PVV website? That the single market is only for goods and services, and not for workers, men and women? That there are good and bad workers, depending on the passport they hold? The internal market is not a one-way street. Its rules apply to everyone alike. They apply to services, to financial transactions and to workers. I will say it again: Europe is not just a single market; it is also and, above all, a community of values. We know only too well that discrimination, racism and xenophobia led to the darkest pages of our history. Here among us are Members whose parents fought and died to liberate Europe and the Netherlands 60 years ago. Can we in all good conscience remain silent and fail to respond to the incitement to hatred of certain parties? I will simply repeat what the Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke said: ‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) reiterates its moral appeal to the Dutch Prime Minster to condemn the offending website clearly and quickly and, like Ms Reding, I am very pleased that here in this Parliament, the democrats have tabled a joint motion.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trust is the foundation of the single market, the foundation of the European Union. However, the financial crisis has undermined this trust, the trust that our fellow citizens have not only for each other but also for policy makers, and this distrust continues to grow. In the face of this danger, we must be unambiguous. We need measures to restore confidence in the good management of our finances and the Treaty to be signed next month will be one of the cornerstones of this. We also need measures to restore confidence in the governance of the euro and this cannot be achieved by issuing contradictory statements. In this regard, I am very surprised by the statements made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the Commission, who is of the opinion that it would not be a tragedy if Greece left the euro area. I ask the Commission: is this your official position? I would ask the Commission to address this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, after years of imprudent management of public finances in many of our countries, now is the time for change. This applies even more to Greece of course, but we will not avoid spending cuts —and Greece cannot take any more. Our Latvian friends showed the way some years ago, by reforming their public management without any outside help and accepting painful sacrifices that led to a return to growth. That is why, for my part, I also trust in the Greek people’s enormous sense of responsibility and I am not among those who would have them believe they will immediately overcome the crisis without reforming. That said, as I stated just after the last European Council, it will take more to build the economy than growth and employment reforms. However, the package proposed to us at this stage is not, in any way, up to the challenge. I firmly believe this is no longer the time for business as usual. It is time to make commitments on a par with those of the post-war Marshall Plan or even the 1992 single market project. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for Europe to be ambitious. The time has come to establish a project which mobilises all our resources to restore growth and employment. My group expects the European Commission to propose a legislative package of this kind, in close cooperation with Parliament, as we did with the ‘six-pack’. This package could include measures as ambitious as completing the internal market. We need to know which countries are still blocking this market. The Single Market Act, the Services Directive and the European Patent are all being blocked by an absurd dispute over location. This package must also reduce the burdens imposed on our businesses which stifle their competitiveness. In return, leave it to them to commit to providing more employment, above all, for young people. Ultimately, there is no magic formula for overcoming this crisis unless we demonstrate political will, have the courage to tell our fellow citizens the truth and see through our commitments. As a former manager, I can tell you, I have lived through many crises and I would ask the Commission and the Heads of State or Government who are always thinking of the next election — I understand this and therefore, it is up to us, in Parliament and in the Commission, to show them the way, to put forward proposals, bold proposals for major projects, for example — to establish the internal market and condemn those who do not. These are measures, small measures, which together will perhaps allow us to quickly return to 1% growth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr Fox, no, we need rules, and I am a firm liberal like you. However, allow me to explain my liberalism for you. Imagine a football pitch. There are two teams playing. I hope the best team wins, but there is still a referee and rules to be respected. That is what I call liberalism. Joseph Daul  (PPE

Blue-card question.
 – (FR) 
Mr Lambsdorff, I do not wish to be rude but although I know Ms Kroes well, as she has been with us for a long time, I see things differently. If Greece files for bankruptcy, there are some insurers who will pay out 75% to certain companies. If it does not file for bankruptcy, these companies will be forced to give up 75%, or even 100%, of what they have invested in Greece. I am simply asking the question and we will ask Ms Kroes whether she ever thought about this. Secondly, I spoke to Mr Samaras on the telephone yesterday evening. He expelled 21 members from his party on Sunday. That is what I call a brave man. Have you ever expelled 21 members because they didn’t vote in favour of a text? It is clear to me that Mr Samaras does not lack courage. He proved this on Sunday evening. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in this Assembly, we are convinced that Europe must both restore its public finances and find the road to growth. That is what you have just said to us. I would like to say to you, Mr Monti, that the economic reforms that you have undertaken in your country serve as an example of this twin approach. On the one hand, you have continued with many reforms initiated by the previous government, and this too you have told us about. On the other hand, you have made major changes, especially by liberalising some professions. That is the right approach as it will create jobs and stimulate competition. Thanks to your proposal to introduce a type of flexible security, you will strengthen the social market economy, and you will make the labour market more dynamic and more protective too. Your fight against fraud and in favour of a more transparent tax system is equally appropriate and will allow a reduction of the tax burden borne by Italians. My group supports this package of measures which, I will repeat, serves as an example for Europe. I hope that many countries will follow suit, since a return to growth requires us to re-establish a favourable economic and political climate. We also have to give hope back to our fellow citizens, not a false hope that would soon be dashed as it foundered on the realities, but a hope based on the development of a more competitive economy and on the indispensable reforms of our collective lifestyle. Now, like most European countries, the Italian economy is strong, as it is built on a real economy, on competitive sectors that are full of potential. Mr Monti, you have begun to optimise this potential, to free the economy from burdens that were overwhelming it. We must do likewise in all of our countries and take our example from those who do it best. We must promote under-used resources via, as you said, both national and European policies. In particular, we must allow our SMEs, our researchers and millions of Europeans, especially the young unemployed, to develop their potential. This policy requires a spirit of responsibility, the very one that you, my dear Mr Monti, are displaying at the head of your government. For some, there is a great temptation to confuse public spending and investment, as you have said, but it is only through investment that we shall achieve sustainable growth. Former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, used to say that one cannot fall in love with the internal market. On the day after Saint Valentine’s Day, neither can one fall in love with European competitiveness. However, Mr Monti, in the report that you have published on the re-launch of the single market, you laid out some good pointers on how to restore growth and employment. I would like to speak about greater fiscal coordination between the Member States. I would like to speak about a new impulse for political and social support for the integration of the European market. I would like to speak about the internal market which, almost 20 years after its launch in 1993, remains unfinished. You reminded us of this. Mr President, although everyone knows how much I favour the Franco-German engine, to the same extent I wish that, like Italy, other countries would make their opinions, their proposals or even their counter-proposals heard. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome your determined commitment to the Community method and to European integration. Like the European Parliament, you know, Mr Monti, that the return of the intergovernmental method would be a serious mistake, a retrograde step for the 500 million Europeans. I am grateful to you for having punched to your full weight. Carry on opposing this intergovernmental method. You have the majority of this Parliament with you. This Parliament wishes to make another voice heard, that of a united, responsible Europe, that of an integrated, political Europe. We know that we can count on you as an ally in this. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, as we speak, more than 600 people have died in Europe, victims of the cold and, above all, isolation. This is an opportunity to remember that Europe is not just about economics and finance. It is first and foremost about solidarity, and the spell of cold weather affecting our people is an opportunity for us to prove it. Yet what are we seeing? Food supplies for European food aid programmes are at their lowest and here we have called for help for the NGOs in charge of them. Some EU countries have taken these programmes hostage and have only renewed them until 2013, using legal problems as an excuse. We are also seeing that not enough is being done in response to the real scandal of food waste. I am referring here to all that is being thrown away by major supermarket chains every day when we all know that there are organisations that do not have enough food to hand out at the moment. It is high time that we reacted by putting our support networks into action. Having been mayor of a village for many years, I know that it is at local level that things first play out and I welcome the informal assistance networks that have sprung up over the last few weeks. These are the most effective networks and these are the ones we must support. We must also react by extending the European food aid programme. It is also high time that we promoted a common energy policy. What, then, are the facts? Today, people in need are having their gas and electricity cut off because they cannot pay their bills. Yet we are reacting much too slowly in all our countries. Here too, we must call for help. Finally, Mr Barnier, we must update the basic European civil protection project that we are so desperately lacking. We must act to stop the same tragedies and the same emergencies from happening again year after year. We have experienced them and we must be prepared. We must provide our NGOs and our fellow citizens who are dealing with these issues with the necessary means to do so rather than passing them over to large organisations. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, 25 Member States faced their responsibilities by agreeing to sign the fiscal treaty. They decided to fight against the poor budget management which has left us without the necessary room for manoeuvre to stimulate growth and employment. They showed their ability to find European solutions to European problems, even though two Member States decided that they would rather go it alone, which they will live to regret. I have, at this stage, three wishes. The first is that this treaty be ratified as quickly as possible, the second is that it be applied as quickly as possible and the third is that this agreement be fully integrated into EU law, as Parliament has called for. Ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has forced us to rethink our bad habits. It has forced us to respect the rules of balanced budgets, which are obvious, yet so difficult to apply. We must reduce national deficits, which also often cover up regional and local deficits. However, while the decision on this treaty is the correct decision and a positive one, the decision on growth leaves me rather disappointed. This is because combating deficits and stimulating growth are two sides of the same coin. One without the other will not help Europeans to escape from the difficulties they are facing, particularly the unemployed. There are two ways of boosting growth: one is artificial and has no future, the other is structural and therefore sustainable. The first is to kick-start the economy through spending. That is what we have been doing for years and look where it has brought us. Never mind the fact that, today, spending is actually limited, as the time has come to repay our debts, and not to borrow. The second method, the one recommended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is to make our economy more competitive. This could already be done, Mr Barroso, by finally completing the internal market. All the laws, all the texts were adopted long ago. The problem, once again, is that they have not been applied. I therefore call on the Commission to let us know as soon as possible which countries are not applying these rules and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties by placing restrictions on those which do not apply them – perhaps even France, my friend, as I make no exceptions. All Europeans should know which States are playing the internal market game, and which States are slowing it down or standing in its way. Increasing our competitiveness could also be achieved by reducing the charges that weigh heavily on entrepreneurs and by reducing the considerable discrepancies in charges between our countries, which harm competitiveness. This could also be done by getting as good a return as possible from European Funds that have been allocated to the States but have not yet been used. The time has come to make the best use of this – considerable – surplus by investing it in common projects to create growth and employment. Finally, growth and job creation can be encouraged by turning public funds, which are not bringing in investments, towards research and innovation, or towards training. With a quarter of young people looking for a job, we must offer them the chance to acquire strong skills and to redirect them anywhere in the EU. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, chairing the Council of Ministers of the Union at this time is not an easy task, but I am sure that, after your training as an MEP, Prime Minister, you are fully equipped for this task. Madam President, I endorse the four priorities under which you have so classically positioned your six months at the head of the Council, namely, responsibility, European dynamism, green Europe and security. I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide. That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however. My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency. I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors. The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method. Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth. Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency. Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens. I wish you all the best for the next six months. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, in 2010 Hungary’s citizens entrusted you by a very large majority with the task of carrying out reforms. You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election. The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature. Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly. Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values. Joseph Daul  (PPE
),  
Blue-card question.

 Mr President, what we are dealing with today is a fundamental discussion about our values and rights. I would like to ask Mr Swoboda: did this Parliament ever have to ask for a commissioner to be sent to Hungary because of repression under the socialist regime? I have never heard of Parliament having made such a request, and no repression of the sort took place. Do you acknowledge that? Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, for once, I am not the first to speak up, but I would just like to point out that a debate has taken place. We are a democracy. If it is not working properly, the democrats are there to listen, to move things forward and change. You have all been to Hungary, as have I. For the time being, you can still move freely in Hungary and I do believe that we will be able to move around Hungary for a very long time to come. Politics is politics, but in Hungary there is freedom of movement. Yet it is true that it is not just Hungary facing the current difficulties; we are all facing them. This applies to the whole of Europe. The current crisis will increase the number of poor and I do not think that it is the Hungarian Government at fault for this. Nor would I accuse the governments of yesteryear blaming them for the deficits. We all have a duty to find the solutions. I am sure that here we are looking for solutions with Viktor Orbán, as he is no Chavez – a name which it pains me to use here in this debate, in a democracy, in a democratic house, this is one step too far and not normal. He is here, even if he is not perfect. Who is perfect? Let he who is perfect cast the first stone. I think that together we will find a solution. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, my dear Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you and to congratulate our new President. I wish you a great deal of courage, lucidity and strength to guide this institution, which collectively represents 500 million Europeans, in the most dignified and responsible way possible. However, I should firstly like to pay tribute to Nirj Deva and Diana Wallis who also stood as candidates to the Presidency of this institution. I should like to say to them that, although the two main groups in this House took the political decision at the beginning of this term of office to entrust the Presidency of Parliament to one of their own Members in turn, my group respects Mr Deva and Ms Wallis for standing as candidates and thanks them for their contribution to this election. However, this morning, Mr Schulz, I should also like to thank your predecessors and, in particular, Jerzy Buzek, whose capabilities as a statesman, which were already well-known in Poland, have been of great benefit to Parliament. Mr Buzek and, before him, Hans-Gert Pöttering and all their predecessors, starting with Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, all of the Presidents here today who have succeeded one another, have, in their own way, strengthened the powers and competences of this institution. Your political action, Mr President, will follow their lead. Mr President, for years we have had the opportunity to work together as chairs of our political groups. For the most part, I do not share your political convictions and our respective political groups have differing opinions on a number of subjects. This has not stopped us from placing our trust in you because, in the difficult situation facing Europe, what brings us together is far more important than what divides us. You are determined, as you have just told us, Mr President, to defend the European general interest resolutely in the face of diverse national interests. My group can only support you fully in this mission, in this action, knowing that the coming months will be one of the most critical periods that Europe has experienced since its creation. In our view, you have three priorities: defending the Community method, supporting the Community method and safeguarding the Community method. Nothing is more important than defending European heritage, namely, guaranteeing the general interest, protecting the small States from the bigger ones, and respecting their points of view without allowing it to lead to a deadlock. Nothing is more important than coming out of the crisis on top, through greater European integration, and nothing is more important than showing our citizens that the euro will be a strong, sustainable currency, insofar as we are doing what we should have done since its creation, namely, implementing political and economic governance. Finally, nothing is more important than preserving the common good that is solidarity between 500 million Europeans. Ladies and gentlemen, by creating what would become the European Union, the founding fathers have left us with a challenge the likes of which has never been seen, namely, uniting the destiny of countries and peoples who, in the past, tore one another apart and fought against one another for centuries. Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi rose to this challenge, and their successors, to this day, have kept this European dream alive in spite of the economic and internal difficulties, and in spite of a radical shift in the global geostrategic situation. It is our generation’s responsibility not to fail in this task. It is up to us to overcome the financial crisis, the current crisis of confidence, to guarantee our children – and you have said it yourself – not only a viable future, but, above all, a better future. This is a challenge primarily facing you, Mr President, and us, ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives of the people of Europe. It is up to you and us, along with the European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to display enough responsibility to convince our States that shared sovereignty, that real economic and political convergence, are our best tools to face the challenge of growth. Mr Schulz, as President of this institution, you will have to face many external challenges, and the PPE Group will be at your side to help you in the European spirit I have just mentioned. We would also encourage you to transmit this message to countries such as Ukraine, where Yulia Tymoshenko has faced unacceptable treatment, or Syria, where the population’s will to change has been unspeakably repressed. You are also planning to improve the internal functioning of Parliament and I welcome this. Your predecessors have largely paved the way and the recent adoption of a code of conduct is fully in keeping with the desire for greater transparency and greater responsibility from each of the Members. My group will therefore support you on this front. Mr President, from now on, you will be leading an institution unlike any other in the world: a plurinational Parliament, which votes on legislation. For two and a half years, you shall be the leader of a House that does not seek to impose on the Council the idea that we will not overcome our current difficulties by creating a new treaty, a new Parliament, new governance, but that seeks to convince the Council of this. Mr President, we will join forces behind you each time you defend this integrated Europe, this Europe of solidarity, this Europe that delivers innovative solutions. We will join forces behind you each time you plead the case of common European policies, as well as each time you fight for funding to live up to the ambitions of these common policies. Finally, we will join forces behind you each time you defend and promote the ideas and values that are the foundations of our Union beyond our borders, namely freedom, tolerance, respect for the weakest in society and solidarity. Mr Schulz, I wish you every success in your Presidency. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Presidents, Mr Tusk, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, rather than speaking myself, I simply wish to subscribe to your speech. At the end of the day, when it comes to speaking about Europe, your discourse is my discourse, it is ours, the discourse of our group, and indeed the discourse of many people within this Parliament. On 6 July, you gave us your vision of a Europe proud of its values, of its successes, of an inclusive Europe, of a Europe confident in its power to exercise its influence throughout the world. This is a vision that we share. Paradoxically, the current crisis may turn out to be a unique opportunity for Europeans to recover their enthusiasm, to bounce back, providing that we are able to adapt, providing that we are able to change our habits and the way we operate. Prime Minister, you indeed have suffered, and you know what suffering is. The old Europe no longer knows what it is to suffer. President-in-Office of the Council, with your government – I shall use just three of the examples that you have mentioned – you have helped to achieve, over your Presidency, the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance. The Polish Presidency, working in close collaboration with the European Parliament on an ambitious package for strong national public finance management, has shown that the Community method can be effective and can sit very well with the euro and the European Union. Similarly, we can credit to this Presidency progress on the supervision of financial markets. More generally speaking, Poland has been working side by side with the European institutions to advance the notion whereby it is an advantage and a way out of the crisis to share economic sovereignty between the 17, the 17 plus and Poland. As you so rightly said, and as I said yesterday, we must put together a way out of the crisis for our fellow citizens for January/February. Second example: the neighbourhood policy. The Polish Presidency has worked extremely energetically, both on the Eastern front, with the signing of the accession of Croatia, and with the launch, last September, of the Eastern Partnership, with the preparation of the association agreement with the Ukraine, and on the Mediterranean front, with European support for the current democratic process. I thank it for that. The third and final example is that in the field of law, the Polish Presidency has enabled considerable progress to be made both on the protection of patents and on European contract law. I hope that we will still be able to carry these through to completion under your Presidency. My group hopes that these efforts will be rewarded and that the final agreement will be signed in the days to come. President-in-Office of the Council, the Polish Presidency has not just produced legislative texts. It has supported a principle dear to my parliamentary group and to the overwhelming majority of this Parliament, namely, the Community method. Indeed, your country, like all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, is more aware than any other country in Europe of the price of freedom, and the importance of solidarity. You have made effectiveness and respect for other people’s opinions a priority, without seeking to impose your own point of view. For many of our Member States, this is an example worth following. We are counting on you – for when you stand down from the Presidency, you will remain an influential member of the Council – to ensure that this Community method returns and is implemented. I shall finish this speech by inviting every one of you in this House to read attentively Minister Radek Sikorski’s Berlin speech. On 28 November, he reminded us that we Europeans are in the uncomfortable position of standing on the edge of a precipice. If we take action, we can emerge from this situation, if not, we shall plunge into the abyss. The Polish Presidency has helped us to take action together. We now need to continue resolutely along this path. I shall repeat a sentence from a very well-known Pole, John Paul II: ‘Have no fear’. Let us work along the lines that you described this morning. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council opened the way, last Thursday and Friday, to governance of the euro area. It showed that the period of waiting, uncertainty and divisions is now behind us and that an end to the crisis is finally in sight. Twenty-six out of 27 States have demonstrated their desire to revert to a healthy finance policy by establishing strict rules allowing for a return to balanced budgets and a reduction in public debt, and by agreeing to incorporate those rules in their constitutions and ensuring that any instances of non-compliance are punished. Twenty-six out of 27 States have shown a sense of responsibility by ensuring that their main political and economic decisions are taken jointly, and by developing crisis mechanisms to be implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB). Twenty-six out of 27 States have conceded that shared sovereignty is preferable to sovereignty held hostage by markets. In short, the spirit of cooperation has prevailed over the attempt to create divisions. Determination has proved stronger than indecision. Three major issues still need to be resolved: that of the nature of the new agreement, that of the United Kingdom’s place in Europe and the attitude of the 26 towards it, and, finally, that of the crucial ‘growth’ strand of our economic policy. Ladies and gentlemen, since the United Kingdom has refused to support the decision taken by its counterparts, the resulting project is not a Community one, as we were hoping, and as I have often said, but an intergovernmental one. This situation presents us with a number of problems, not only legal problems, but political problems, too. My group calls for the European institutions to be fully involved in the discussions that will culminate in the drafting of the new provisions between now and March, and, in particular, for Parliament to be accorded its rightful place in this process so that it can ensure its democratic legitimacy. I solemnly call upon Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso to work closely with the European Parliament. We must ensure, in fact, that no radical changes are made to the spirit and the letter of what has been done for the last 60 years and what has made European integration the success that it is. Cohesion must continue to prevail over power struggles, something which only the Community method can ensure. The second major issue raised by the decision of 9 December concerns the United Kingdom’s place in Europe, and I will come to this. I respect the decisions that were made but, clearly, the UK’s isolation shows that its government sees the European Union as nothing but a free trade area, and that it has no interest in showing solidarity with, and acting responsibly towards, its partners. To my mind, this calls for a change in behaviour towards the country by the 26 and also, to some extent, within the European institutions. In particular, I believe that the UK rebate should be called into question, since the resources of our fellow citizens should be used for something other than rewarding selfish, nationalist attitudes. Solidarity is not a one-way street. It is time Mr Cameron’s coalition government was made to realise that and was reminded of its obligations, in particular, with regard to the financial regulation rules from which it even requested an exemption, which fortunately was refused. The third and final issue relates to the ‘growth and employment’ strand of our economic policy. Of course, there will be no growth unless we put our public accounts in order, but the Union must now set about strengthening and developing its industrial activities, exports and competitiveness with the same level of energy and coordination. Indeed, Europe will not resolve the crisis permanently without a radical two-pronged approach consisting of sound management, on the one hand, and growth, on the other. As far as Parliament is concerned, I believe that we need to work closely with the Commission, on the basis of the proposals it made two months ago. I believe that we must do so, Mr President, in order to overcome the crisis, and that we must vote by a very large majority in February. This is what I propose as ‘homework’ for the Christmas holiday, and on that note, I wish all of you and your families a very happy Christmas. (Applause)

Blue-card answer.

 Mr President, I would like to reassure my fellow Member. With Christmas nearly upon us, I have neither a tank nor a Kalashnikov. Therefore, he is not in any danger over the Christmas holiday; you can be sure of that, Lord Dartmouth. Secondly, I clearly said that, if, as I believe, the United Kingdom has given up on showing solidarity with the other 26 States for now, then I do not see why the 26 should make a further concession regarding the budget. Let me be quite clear: this is not a declaration of war; it is simply about ensuring that solidarity is shown between everyone and not just one way. That is all! Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis is turning everything on its head and things are changing at an increasingly dramatic pace: changes in Greece and Italy, with the establishment of governments of national unity, which we welcome; whereas until now, our citizens saw European integration as being far removed from their day-to-day lives, now they are calling for more integration. Well, not everyone, as just yesterday, David Cameron saw fit to attack a Europe to which, last time I checked – yesterday afternoon –, his country still belongs, when what we really want is constructive positions, even from him, on how to emerge from the crisis. Still, all the influential players in the Union acknowledge – as I have been saying for years – that the answer to our problems is not less but more Europe. The solution is Europe. I think some presidents realise this. Those who do not are replaced; which is a good thing. A Europe that needs to be transformed along the lines of integration which should have been done when the euro was created because, I will say it again, the current crisis is not just a crisis of the euro which, this morning, Mr Juncker, was still trading at around 1.35 against the dollar – or 1.34 as it might have dropped a centime, which is still acceptable. The reason for this crisis is the mistake made in setting up a currency without giving it the governance needed to make it work. We need to acknowledge this political error, but, above all, we need to put it right, and very quickly. That is what the euro area Member States are being forced to try and do and, once again, I congratulate the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, which is hard at work but which, in my opinion, is not working quickly enough because when your house is burning down, the fire-fighters get to work and, I tell you, fire-fighters are never criticised. I used to be a voluntary fire-fighter myself. We would sum up after the fire: we would look at what had been lost and what could be improved. That is what I am asking of you, Mr Van Rompuy. Do not be afraid. Be stronger. We will work it out later. However, once again, I want to emphasise the importance of crisis management which is a new source of division in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing it more and more, we need to take care to distinguish between those that are in a deep crisis and those that have managed it better. We need to recognise this. I want to stress how crucial it is that the Seventeen take into account all the instruments of the Euro Plus Pact when making any decisions on governance of the euro area. Mr Juncker, this is your job, do it. There are many countries wanting to join the euro area. We must not create different categories of players in this Euro Plus zone. We must not leave those countries wanting to join warming up on the sidelines. We must not exclude them from strategic decisions taken in the dressing rooms. I want to underline, here, the merit of countries like Poland, which has the Presidency, and which, despite not yet being in the euro area, are making extremely brave efforts, from a political viewpoint, to clean up their finances and boost growth. We should encourage them; we should make them feel a part of our club. Similarly, and I shall say it again, we should not abandon the Community method. As much as I firmly believe that the Franco-German alliance is a key driving force in Europe – which recent weeks have again proved –, I call on all Member States to contribute and go further than Paris and Berlin, instead of complaining about the impetus provided by Paris or Berlin. Nobody is stopping them. Likewise, Mr Barroso, I also call on the European Commission, with your commissioners, to do everything in your power to safeguard, strengthen and shield European cohesion. Do what you can to reassure small and medium-sized States that the Community method is still the glue that holds us together, that makes us stand firm and binds us together. It is in times of difficulty that it needs to be reinforced. That is the main responsibility of both institutions, the European Parliament and the Commission, which stand up for the European general interest. I want to finish my part in the debate on a possible revision of the European Treaties. Yes, changes will definitely need to be made to put right what is necessary. Yes, these will definitely have to be major adaptations, given the significance of the issues at stake. My group is open to this process as long as there is open, democratic debate involving elected representatives and civil society as part of an agreement. Above all, however, we must not fall back into the temptation of spending all our time talking about the mechanical tools, to the detriment of our political objectives. We must not lose sight of what is urgent, namely credible economic governance, and of what is less urgent, and let us do what can and must be done to current treaties, if necessary by making small changes to the rules of procedure as I call them. I am thinking of the establishment of the internal market, of the rules governing financial supervision or credit rating agencies. I am thinking about the political role played by the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for economic and monetary affairs, which is yet to be defined. I am thinking about the rapid implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of macroeconomic surveillance. (The President interrupts the speaker following an interruption off-microphone from Mr Bloom)
 I am thinking about real budgetary, fiscal and social integration. Mr President, it is Europe which speaks while the anti-Europeans scream and shout. That is not my way of moving Europe forward. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, to start with, I would like to point out that in life, one can either see the glass as half full or half empty. I see the glass as half full. I would like to thank you for the work you have done over the last 48 hours, because as a farmer, I know that it is not always the right horse that gets the oats, and this morning I would like to give you the oats and tell you ... (Laughter and applause)
 If he does not like oats, he can give them to the Commissioners; no problem there, a few of them like them. The elements that I picked up straightaway from your speech, and which I want to reiterate here, are that we are dealing with the banks, we are not doing enough to challenge the rich, you understand what I mean by that, but above all, and I thank you for saying it, we need to take care of the poorest. It would be outrageous if we failed to find a solution concerning the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons before the winter months. (Applause)
 Some people thought that everything would be sorted out by Monday. I do not think anyone here in this House believed that, since we are responsible men and women. However, we were still apprehensive, and late last night I watched the news to see whether we would effectively have an even deeper crisis this morning or, as I have often said, whether we would start to see the end of the crisis take shape. I believe this Council has at least come up with an initial solution to the crisis, and I congratulate both of you – I know that it is not easy. Undoubtedly it does not go far enough, but I will come back to this. I also wish to highlight the progress made by the 17 countries in the euro area. Over recent weeks, we have seen the 17 countries in the euro area being criticised by those who are not part of it. I would like to point out, in this Parliament, that we are all Europeans, whether we are inside or outside the euro area. Nevertheless, we have duties and rights, and those who took centre stage the most were the 17. Here too I believe we have made progress. With regard to solidarity with Greece, following the release by the Troika of a new tranche of loans, the agreement announced last night with the banks sees 50% of the debt being written off. This is an achievement. The increase of the European Financial Stability Facility’s firepower is a step in the right direction and, as everyone knows, one of the trickiest aspects of the negotiation. The agreement of the 17 on this point is absolutely crucial. By ensuring that this Fund acts as a credit insurance for investors who buy loan certificates from countries deemed vulnerable, the resources of the Stability Fund will be increased. The third area in which progress has been made is bank recapitalisation. I believe that we have already referred to this. Consequently, the European Council and the euro area have kept their promises for the short term and for part – a small part, I would stress – of the medium term. My group encourages you to progress even more quickly, and you are not on holiday as far as I understand. Tomorrow morning further progress will have to be made. The most important thing is to adopt a new model of economic governance, without which the euro cannot work effectively in the long run. We say the same things every day here, but we can see that by dint of repeating ourselves, some things are starting to be done. This integration and this European policy are an absolute necessity. I note that the countries which are the first to ask the euro area to take strong action have, for years and even decades, vigorously rejected any proposal for fiscal harmonisation. They are quite simply being inconsistent. Ladies and gentlemen, the European project is not about imposing something on someone. The European project is not about placing anyone under supervision, nor about governing with no regard for the democratic balance of powers. However, the rules must be complied with, Mr Barroso, and we must ensure that the measures that have been accepted and signed on paper are truly applied in practice. The European project and the strategy for Europe are about an ambition: that of offering the 500 million inhabitants the chance to live with dignity. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) does not want us to depend in future on Chinese and Brazilian investment, but to draw on our own work and our own know-how. What the PPE Group wants is to map out the route that will lead to that outcome, and that requires a shared European sovereignty between all those who want it. Mr Van Rompuy, yesterday you made good decisions, difficult and brave decisions. Nonetheless, these measures are not the end result of a plan to exit the crisis, they are merely the beginning. I call on the Member States, I call on Members of Parliament, both national and European, and I also call on our fellow citizens to agree to further political integration. I call on this Parliament and, Mr Barroso, on the European Commission, to carry on defending the EU model, which is a model of inclusion and not exclusion. I hope that next week, the G20 will respect the decisions that Europe has taken. For that to happen, though, they must be sure that we will not stop halfway. We need more fiscal and social integration, even if it is not written in the Treaty. We need to move forward in that area. We cannot afford to wait 10 years, to wait until we have amended the Treaty. We must adopt rules of procedure if the Treaty cannot be implemented quickly. I think that we are in the process of proving that in the difficult moments of managing a crisis, we can make progress without respecting the Treaty to the letter. And that was a little painful for us in the European Parliament. We felt to some extent that we had been forgotten. However I do think, Mr Barroso, and you said so this morning, that you are applying what we voted for here. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, once again, our Parliament is being asked to debate the decisions that we expect to be taken by a European Council and, once again, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is calling for a European response – an EU response – to the crisis. Once again, a resolution will be adopted, tomorrow, by an overwhelming majority of MEPs, calling on the Heads of State or Government to show a sense of responsibility when they meet on 23 October. Like most of my colleagues who are present, I sometimes feel as though I am repeating myself and taking part in a discussion between the institutions and our Member States in which everyone is talking at cross purposes. Yes, we agree on the significance of the crisis, on the urgent need to come up with solutions, and on the vital mix of deficit reduction measures and measures to boost growth and employment, but we differ as to the measures that need to be taken and whether those measures should be taken piecemeal or with surgical precision. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must stop debating the ways in which it could possibly take its decisions and whether or not it should embark upon yet another reform of the Treaties. Europe must stop analysing, weighing things up and, above all, hesitating. Europe must act; Europe must put a stop to the debate about solidarity with Greece. Of course it must show solidarity, and the decision taken by the Troika yesterday was just as responsible as the political point-scoring episode in the Slovak Parliament was irresponsible. Europe must stop questioning whether or not we should cut our public deficits. Of course we should tackle public deficits at national and regional level! It is just a question of knowing how to do so and of making sure that any action we take is completely fair from a fiscal and social point of view. President Barroso, I am not going to read the text that I prepared for the Commission. I am simply going to congratulate you and tell you that I agree with what you have said today and that I am behind it. The only thing I would add is that I wish you luck in getting it past the Council, and you will have the support of our political group. Go for it, do not be afraid. Measures need to be taken before Christmas. Thank you very much, then, for this presentation that you have delivered to us today. When I talk about Europe, I am not just talking about Brussels and Strasbourg. I am also talking about Bratislava, London, and all the European capitals. They must understand that real sovereignty is not just the gilded treasures found in republican or royal palaces. Real sovereignty, ladies and gentlemen, is the ability to give our fellow citizens the life they deserve, the standard of living they work for, and freedom. We will not achieve that by withdrawing behind our national borders, closing the Schengen borders again or bringing back protectionism. Growth and jobs – although I know that the anti-Europeans do not agree, and I love the fact that they are grumbling, because it means that we are on the right track (Applause)
. Mr Farage, you gave a good example of this at the last Conference of Presidents, and I hope that it will be the same today – growth and jobs, President-in-Office of the Council, will only materialise again in Europe if, as from 23 October, our Member States play the game, the European game, the solidarity game, the game of ‘all for one and one for all’ fully, unconditionally and quickly. Let me say it again, for the third time in my speeches: we need to bring into line tax rates, retirement age and weekly working time, to mention just a few examples. My group has not given me enough time to list everything that is impossible in Europe. However, you know that the word ‘impossible’ is not in the French vocabulary. Therefore, anything is possible, and that is also my party’s slogan. Europe must act, and I am convinced that it will succeed. President Barroso, we need a response for our fellow citizens. What kinds of questions are we having to answer today in our campaigns? When I listen to people who have worked hard all their lives, who have a savings book, I find that the question they ask is: ‘Are our savings and what we have struggled to acquire throughout our life protected by Europe and the euro?’ Yes, they are protected! Yes! Therefore, that is the response we must give them; that is the guarantee we must confirm to them. We have a duty, at Heads of State or Government level and in the European institutions, to give them that initial response. As far as everything else is concerned, you are right; we do have the tools, we do have the political means. If we implement them, we will overcome the crisis. Moreover, I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that European countries are not the only ones that are contacting our offices today. We are also being contacted by those who are already worried about whether we are going to succeed and whether the euro, at EUR 1.10 perhaps, is going to revive the European economy in relation to that of other continents, which are beginning to ask themselves questions. As you have said, then, let us take action together, ladies and gentlemen; let us not play cat and mouse, but let us be bold. I am convinced that we are now going to pave the way for our exit from the crisis, for Europe’s exit from the crisis, so that we can restore it to its place in the world in which we want to live. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Joseph Daul  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 The answer is very simple, Ms Jaakonsaari. We have done the following: last weekend, four of my colleagues travelled to Greece to hold talks with our sister party, in order to move things forward, as you mentioned in your question. We are therefore working on this issue every day, and at the end of the week, three more people travelled to the country. We are working in close cooperation both with the party and with the Greek delegation, and we are also discussing this issue within our group. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr Barroso, it is heart-warming to hear such a speech. Like you, I may give an analysis, but after this speech, we will act together. Europe is going through a confidence crisis and a growth crisis. As if that was not enough, it is going through a leadership crisis. It is high time that Europe came up with a political answer to the crisis. A united and strong answer, which puts politics in its rightful place, that is to say in the driving seat; I am talking to the Council. Because, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about a currency – the euro – created 10 years ago. We truly believe that we are giving ourselves the means to secure its governance. We talk about countries which, for decades, have lived above their means, always more, without wondering whether or not the money spent actually created growth and jobs. We talk about a Europe born to prevent internal conflicts and to ensure its peoples’ prosperity, a Europe that, until now, has succeeded on all these fronts. But we also talk about a Europe that is misunderstood, even criticised, because its leaders have not been able to explain why the choice of Europe is the only choice for the future and why the answer to global challenges can only be a European one. All too often, one forgets that the European Union is one of the most advanced and developed regions. It is the world’s leading power in terms of trade. Our duty is above all to make sure that it remains in that position. What is the problem, then? And how can it be solved? The problem is that, even though economists agree on the reasons behind the financial and economic crisis, and on how to respond to it – namely a mix of rigour and incentives for creating wealth and employment – the political class has not had the courage to set about the task. The reforms proposed these last few months by the Member States of the Union and of the euro area, in particular, are along the right lines. However, they are clearly insufficient, late and poorly explained, or not explained at all. They stem from the intergovernmental method which – it is plain to see – paralyses Europe, as you rightly said. The national approach, ladies and gentlemen, must give way to the European approach. We do not want to discuss subsidiarity here, but the Community approach is the only one that will enable us to meet in a united and effective way the urgent and huge challenges that are before us. I can understand that, in times of crisis, one feels the need to turn in on oneself. No, we must reach out and seek the Community approach. The European method is not two, three or four Presidents bringing different messages, but a single and swift exit strategy. Mr Barroso, you are the head of the executive for economic governance. You demonstrated it this morning in your speech. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) urges you to fully play your double role of proposing and implementing European legislation decided with the Council and Parliament. The Commission has a crucial role to play: that of guarantor of the European general interest. This is difficult and demanding, but necessary: we must resist national interests which are not always compatible with the common interest. (Applause)
 This is essential. That is why this Parliament placed its trust in you at the beginning of the mandate and continues to do so. Mr Barroso, I ask you to go even further in your ambitions, because there is urgency. There is urgency to save the euro, to demonstrate our solidarity towards Greece and towards all the member countries that are seeing their markets attacked and their rating downgraded. At the same time, it is urgent that these same countries adopt and implement measures that are a match for the events, for European solidarity comes at that price. We must act urgently, not in the months, but in the days and weeks to come, to prove to the world that Europeans are able to defend and stabilise their currency. If they do not do it, the whole European project will suffer in the long term. The decision that – I hope – this Parliament will take today on economic governance, the famous ‘six pack’, is an important step in the right direction. We now have to apply it as soon as possible, and the same goes for the decisions of 21 July on the stability funds. Mr Barroso, entrepreneurs need visibility and security. The markets expect the euro area and the countries of the Union as a whole to take strong and consistent measures for reducing expenditure but also for supporting growth. On the first aspect – that of streamlining public expenditure – a few days ago I called for a ‘big bang’, a common decision of the 17 on fiscal, budgetary and social convergence. I reiterate this call today. It is very difficult for one country in isolation to take the strong measures that the euro area’s financial situation requires. However, we must recognise that the election campaigns that are coming up in several European countries in the next few years will undoubtedly not be conducive to courageous measures. Therefore, I ask the Commission to seize the proposal to bring into line tax rates, particularly for businesses, but also retirement age and weekly working time. Europeans will only stand shoulder to shoulder with each other if they see the same rules applied. That is when we can feel European. (Applause)
 I am convinced that strong and swift decisions by the 17 on this triple convergence would have considerable impact and would be a tangible sign of leadership on Europe’s part. Ladies and gentlemen, I said this earlier on: the current crisis is as much a crisis of confidence, which calls for collective decisions like those I have just described, as it is a growth crisis. And without growth, Europe will be unable to reimburse even the interest on its debt. Without growth, Europe will not be able to develop or survive competition from emerging countries. This growth requires increased competitiveness, more resources allocated to education and training, as well as increased efforts in research, development and innovation. I call for a new public-private partnership with a view to creating centres of excellence in research and innovation and to creating – why not? – an Erasmus programme for first jobs, following the success of the Erasmus university scheme. I would like to see the European political policy-makers listening more to entrepreneurs and to social partners, since they are the ones who live with the reality of globalisation and who can help us emerge from the crisis. Ladies and gentlement, achieving growth also requires that we pay special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must not ride roughshod over them. They are the ones who bring us jobs and who help us to overcome the crisis. Yet they are asked to bear administrative, fiscal and social costs that are too high. If we want them to be able to expand and hire people, this growth will require greater flexibility for investing as well as for keeping and creating jobs. Ladies and gentlemen, the single market was the great idea of the 1980s. With the single market, Europe has won growth points and our manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale by gaining access to a continental market instead of a national one. Nonetheless, we all know that the European single market is far from being completed, especially in the services sector. I am asking the European Commission to get down to the task with as much ambition and determination as it showed 20 years ago. That is where growth is. Ladies and gentlemen, growth cannot be decreed. It is achieved by a whole series of structural measures, the ones precisely that we have already adopted in the Europe 2020 strategy. We now need to roll up our sleeves and above all apply these measures. It is time for Europe to speak strongly and intelligibly, not only to counter populism, which is the enemy of the European people, but to propose long-term solutions that our citizens understand and expect. It is time that our elected national representatives accept that voluntarily shared sovereignty is the only future for our countries, and I mean the only one. I am asking you, Mr Barroso, to propose to the European Parliament and to the Council a plan to get us out of the crisis. A plan that can be, for the 500 million Europeans, the chance for a fresh start, the chance to overhaul their project. We need bold actions and proposals, understood – I repeat – by our fellow citizens. Europe has always made progress in crises, but we still have to make the right proposals and believe in them. I always say that, before the crisis and after the crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. Things will be different. Mr Barroso, we must propose this change to our fellow citizens so that once again they believe in politics and in Europe. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr Juncker, for weeks and months now, the leaders of the euro area have shown how determined they are to stand up for the euro and to make European solidarity the cornerstone for their political actions. Yet we need to recognise that what has been decided since the summer is not enough, is too late and, above all, difficult to implement. You get the feeling that it is the markets rather than politics now in the driving seat. That cannot last. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that only strong and simultaneous EU decisions will have the necessary weight to reassure our fellow citizens and the markets of our decision-making ability. Mr Juncker, intergovernmental management of the crisis has reached the end of the road. As both a head of government and President of the Eurogroup, can you tell us then what the plans are to get us out of the crisis? The worst thing is that we cannot see a way out. There are a number of instruments: Eurobonds, guarantees from AAA countries, quadrupling the stability fund’s firepower, but over and above these instruments, where is the political will and how do we bring it all together? We need to be strong and, above all, we need to lead the way in getting out of the crisis. So where are you? (Applause
) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the European Union has been seeking sustainable solutions; however, faced with the attacks on the euro, initiatives have been taken. I am referring here to the first public finance consolidation measures and to the positive golden rule proposal. I am also referring to the introduction of measures to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility and the establishment of new economic governance instruments, or the six-pack, on which I should like to see a definitive agreement reached before the end of the month. I am also referring to the coordination of national budgets and to this summer’s proposals regarding European economic governance, the financial transactions tax and tax harmonisation. (The speaker broke off due to an interpreting problem)
 Mr President, since the start of the crisis, billions of euros have been committed. European citizens are indeed concerned, as they can see no end to the efforts being asked of them. They feel as if they are feeding a bottomless pit, even though they are aware that this European crisis calls for a Europe-wide response and not only a national one. They question the ability of national and European leaders to end this crisis of confidence and growth once and for all. The markets remain unsatisfied, doubtful and particularly volatile, and react to the slightest rumour. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come, for eurozone Member States and for any other EU Member States that would like to be involved, to pull out all the stops and adopt strong measures, together and at the same time, to put an end to the doubts over the EU’s capacity to shoulder its responsibilities. President Barroso, President-in-Office of the Council, Europe must restore its credibility. Europe must face up to reality and regain control of public finances. It must prepare itself for a transitional period characterised by stringent financial management at both national and regional level, and by incentives for savers and for investment in innovation, education and training. Europe must undergo a dramatic transformation to be referred to as the federation of the United States of Europe, or simply integration. In this crisis, as in any other crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before. The question is: are we capable, right now, of envisaging a different future for ourselves? I recommend that, on the basis of a Commission proposal, all eurozone governments and all other EU governments who so wish, take a decision to drastically reduce their debts by taking coordinated measures, all at once and on the same day, to ensure the viability of their pension systems and to actually harmonise their taxation, in particular their corporate taxation. By suddenly making economic governance a reality, and one that is accepted by all the Member States of the euro area, the EU would achieve two things: it would demonstrate its capacity to take long-term action, and it would strengthen cohesion between citizens, who would at last be subject to the same rights and obligations. By taking coordinated budgetary discipline measures while stimulating crucial growth in our economies, countries would establish a single or converging set of rules and would send a clear and strong message as to their will to further integration. I should like to say a word, President Barroso, about growth. We are constantly saying ‘growth, growth’. Many people still dream of achieving double-digit growth. Our primary duty is to sustain low growth and avoid deflation. The European institutions, for their part, must be more ambitious as regards common policies. We need those policies that we refer to regularly: a trade policy, an ambitious research policy, a food-safety policy, an industrial policy that has finally undergone reform, and above all a policy enabling the internal market to function properly. We have many regulations, but in these difficult times it remains to be seen whether they are actually applied. If there are things which need revising, we will revise them, but there is no need to add to them in the current climate. Let us also enhance integration of the euro area, the heart of European integration, in order to help reform the European Union. That is what we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for, as we are aware of the responsibility of the centre-right, which is in the driving seat in times of trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, our credibility is going to be at stake over the coming months. It is true that we are under very heavy attack, which is probably exaggerated in some areas. It is now up to us to show that the EU has the capacity to restore growth conditions and avoid succumbing to deflation. This, too, will safeguard employment levels. Everything must be done to protect our way of life as much as possible and to defend our values. A major integration effort is ultimately not the way to succeed. Instead, ladies and gentlemen, we must find a way, among responsible democratic political groups, of showing a new approach and a new path to our Heads of State or Government, who are in a very difficult situation. What I am asking of this Parliament, and of President Barroso and the President-in-Office of the Council, over the coming weeks, is unity, that is to say a single vision for European citizens for the four or five years to come. That is what we must work towards today. Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, Prime Minister Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, by way of an introduction, allow me to say, Mr President-in-Office, that if, during these six months, you apply the European method you have described this morning – as I do not doubt you will – we will be considering ways to extend the Polish Presidency of Europe. (Applause)
 European integration will be at the heart of the priorities of the new Presidency of the Council, to the great satisfaction of our group. This integration, and especially this Community method, must feature in all the major debates over the coming months and years. I am thinking of the financial resources of Europe. It is a significant issue that we will discuss together for the 2014-2020 period. I am also thinking of the internal market. Mr Tusk, you are concerned about the rise of Euroscepticism in several countries. I share this concern, as does my group. Euroscepticism and isolationism are symptoms of a cancer in our society. Your response to this ‘every man for himself’ attitude is a call for integration, which echoes the watchword of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is not the problem, but ‘more Europe’ is the solution. Your Presidency will be dominated by the necessary consolidation of public finances in the Member States, the stabilisation of the euro and the opening of the debate on the financial framework. The euro can only be stabilised if the countries experiencing difficulties really implement the necessary reforms in order to reform public finances and to create the conditions to enable a return to sustainable growth. Half-hearted measures will not solve the underlying problems. If I take the case of Poland, which is growing by nearly 4% and, with an uncommon level of efficiency, has known how to best use EU funds since it became a member, I see that European solidarity, combined with political will, can lead to the construction of a real, solid economy. Mr Tusk, you are one of the few Heads of State or Government in Europe to agree to debate with the national parliaments, with this Parliament and with other European institutions about the issue of the resources needed for Europe to operate. You are, moreover, the only one willing to discuss an issue that is important to a large majority in this Parliament, namely, the introduction of own resources to finance Europe’s role. Therefore, we will be by your side to deal with this issue seriously and we know that this task will be challenging. The Presidency of the Council believes that all our economic and social policies must be based on the Europe 2020 strategy, which all Member States have already accepted. It is right because the economic crisis will only be overcome in a sustainable manner if the Member States understand that all 27 States acting together is less expensive and much more productive than each one acting in isolation. Solidarity, ladies and gentlemen, is not just virtuous; it is also profitable. That goes for European finances as well as for the internal market and I am pleased that the Polish Presidency has established this issue and, in particular, electronic services, improved working conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the long-awaited creation of a European patent system, or indeed the Single Market Act, as its main concerns. Mr Tusk, just like the European Parliament, you have found the recent disagreements on the Schengen issue hard to bear. My group supports you in your desire to strengthen our resources and our joint effort on our external borders. In this regard, I call on the Commission and the Council to take a clear position on the unilateral decision made by Denmark to exempt itself from the rules on freedom of movement. My group would like to express its serious concerns. I would like to know what your position is, and that of the President of the Commission. (Applause)
 Mr Barroso, some commissioners will not be able to take holidays in July and August, since it will also be necessary, at this time, to closely monitor the Danish borders. I stated yesterday that perhaps we should think about introducing visas for Danes to be sent to Europe so they are better protected! Just as the European Parliament has done, you have identified the key challenges for Europe, which are food security and energy dependence. It will certainly not be possible to resolve all these issues in just six months. You will at least be able to take the credit for raising them and, as I told you when we met in Warsaw, it will be you who will lay the foundations, and I am certain that they will be solid foundations. I shall conclude by commending your determination in the management of relations with your neighbours. We have recently often discussed support for our southern neighbours, and firm policies on this issue should be developed. Relations with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, as well as with other countries like Ukraine and Belarus, in particular, are just as deserving of our attention and efforts. Mr Tusk, my group has great expectations of your political will and your leadership. I shall conclude by drawing inspiration from the words of a great Pole whom you know well, Pope John Paul II: ‘Do not be afraid, Mr Tusk: go ahead; we are with you’. Joseph Daul,

Mr President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has shown how the rotating Presidency has continued to play an important role in our decision-making system. We have to recognise the importance of the advances that have been made in these last few months on a number of fronts. Firstly, there are the advances on the economic front, with the progress that has been made on governance and the success of the first-ever European Semester. Secondly, there is the common policy front, with the measures taken concerning social cohesion, the common agricultural policy, food security, the single market, the Danube strategy and, of course, energy policy. Thirdly, there is the external front, with the accession of Croatia, but also the expression of our solidarity with our Japanese friends and with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Let me inform you, Mr Orbán, of the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on most of these points. First, I want to thank the Hungarian Presidency. In particular I would thank the Minister of State for EU Affairs, our former fellow Member Mrs Győri, for the enormous efforts she has made towards taking the governance package forward and, in particular, granting Parliament’s requests for the Community method to be applied. We have been successful on 90% to 95% of our requests. I am very disappointed that, because of the stance some people have taken, we cannot reach a conclusion this week as planned. Without economic governance, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no stability for the euro. Without a stable euro, the chances of Europe winning the battle for growth, and thus the battle for employment and social cohesion, are next to nothing. The PPE Group is convinced of this. President of the Council, I also want to emphasise the progress that has been made on common policies since January. There has been progress on the cohesion policy, with the agreement reached in February on the strengthening of this device in the coming years. There has also been progress on the common agricultural policy, with the agreement reached in March on the broad outlines of the reform, against a background of worrying increases in the prices of raw materials as well as ever greater challenges in relation to food security. Thirdly, there has been progress on energy and innovation, strategic themes to which an entire meeting of the European Council was devoted at the start of February, one month before the Fukushima tragedy. Finally, there has been progress on the single market, which will be consolidated further thanks to the Single Market Act. On all these major topics, the Hungarian Presidency has made progress in spite of a difficult political and economic environment. I would add one important element to that, namely the policy on the Roma, on which you, Mr Orbán, have been able to conciliate the Europeans and propose specific actions. I am particularly grateful to you for that. I will end by mentioning the advances made in the area of external affairs. I have already had the opportunity to welcome the progress made by Croatia during the last few months; it is only because of this that the 27 were able to give it the green light for its accession in accordance with the timetable that President Orbán wished for, starting in January. This accession is good news for the Croatian people. It is also good news for the peoples of the Balkans, who must be able to rely on a concrete European perspective. The events that have occurred in the Mediterranean, too, have dominated the Presidency to a great extent. Europe has managed to give a clear demonstration of moral solidarity, but has also shown real solidarity with its southern neighbours, and it has also managed to resolve the problems that arose concerning the economic refugees who immigrated to the Italian coast. At the same time – and I am particularly happy about this – the Schengen area has been opened up to Romania and Bulgaria, not in order to do them a favour, but because they are respecting the rules that apply to everyone. This shows that European solidarity has to be earned and that effort is rewarded. I thank the Hungarian Presidency and wish all the best to the Polish Presidency. Joseph Daul,

Madam President, you know that I am always very brief. Martin, we are proper Democrats –
 you respect democracy and so do we. It is true that it is easier to win than to lose. We will continue the negotiations and at the beginning of July, we will take a final vote on the report after negotiation. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Győri, I would firstly like to say a brief word to you, in acknowledgement of all the work you have done and especially of the methodical approach you employed and the hours you devoted to this work, with Parliament in particular. I think that is worth mentioning and so, once again, thank you. (Applause)
 You are applauding her, but it could not have been any other way: we have trained her well within our group. Therefore, she knows what Parliament is all about. Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances. Seldom have expectations been so high among the people in our various countries, expectations of brave and united decisions from their leaders on the burning issue of the euro and the debt crisis, as well as on economic governance. In several countries, and especially in Greece, our fellow citizens are confused, anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children’s future. I would like to take this opportunity to send out three messages to our Greek friends. Firstly, Europe is in solidarity with them, and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility – and I stress the word responsibility. Secondly, the situation that they – and indeed many other countries in Europe – are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means. This has to be said, and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality. My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term. This will involve making sacrifices, but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end. This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country’s twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation. Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking – that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) – or, after having expressed their concern, they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy. My group, ladies and gentlemen, is calling for a shake-up. It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial. We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves – and when I say ‘us’, I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens. This brings me back to the European Council, from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity. However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily, as they have done in the past. When the Council, with Parliament, decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States, it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity. We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with. If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past. I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that. I will conclude on a positive note, by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th Member State in a few months’ time. This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government, whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend. This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans, who are doubting themselves right now. However, the values that Europe embodies – solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity – have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else. I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view. Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro and public debt crisis demand solutions at European and not national level. This is the message that Mr Barroso, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, has been sending the Member States for months. However, a European solution means European funding. My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe, both in its objectives and its terms of reference. My question to the Council is as follows: is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s? Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable? I think not. It is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers. It has changed, and it would be irresponsible not to reflect these changes in the ways in which Europe is funded, in other words, in the way Europe is designed. (The speaker broke off, hoping to continue his speech later) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe’s new realities, trends and aims. Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe’s place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed. It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes. The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate. When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources. We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets. This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets. Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits. Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States. Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year. Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts. So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances. Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments. Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt. Europeans need to be told the truth. The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum. The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish. The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen. The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage. Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe’s capacity for influencing the world. The European Parliament – and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me – is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework. If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever. If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects. Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe. Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes. As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions – some more peaceful than others – taking place in a number of neighbouring Mediterranean countries and, more recently, by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism, namely, the end of the Bin Laden era. What is Europe’s role in all of this? Are we willingly and actively involved in the situation? Yes, we certainly are. The action being taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government has demonstrated that, when it wants to, Europe – or some of Europe – can act decisively in difficult times. Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding ‘No’. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion. Europe backed stability and development aid in the Mediterranean. Yet the people are – quite legitimately – demanding political freedom and are fleeing their countries because there is no prospect of a life of dignity and opportunity for them and their children. The humanitarian assistance that we have provided over recent months has definitely been useful. Baroness Ashton, we need to do more. Have we begun to learn from these events? I would like to think so. What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea – and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths – are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement. (Applause)
 Is all of this worthy of Europe, of European values, principles and ideals? I do not think so, nor does my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) nor, I am sure, do the majority of Members in this House. Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon. We now need to move on and take action. That entails making choices and sticking to them. What, then, are Europe’s priorities? Relations with our eastern and southern neighbours? Combating terrorism? A solution to the conflict in the Middle East? Trade policy? Tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task. Who are our preferential partners? The United States, emerging countries, or others? How can we achieve the best results? By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice? Ladies and gentlemen, an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs, security and defence: instead, we need more Europe. We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level. Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives. Ladies and gentlemen, 2011 should be the year of the Mediterranean, of combating terrorism, even of achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East conflict. If Europe is capable of becoming a key player in this area, it will be able to put the errors of its youth behind it. Let me close with a quote from someone very familiar to you: John Paul II. ‘Do not be afraid,’ Baroness Ashton. We have made savings of EUR 4 billion in the European budget. Please come up with some proposals for using that money, rather than returning it to the Member States. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentleman, the last European Council has set our countries on the right track. By increasing the capacity of the Solidarity Fund and deciding to make it permanent, the 27 have once again demonstrated their commitment to the euro and the importance they place on solidarity between the more financially stable countries and those facing temporary difficulties. At the same time, the decision to seal a euro pact between eurozone countries, and further afield, is indicative of the political will of European leaders to draw lessons from the financial crisis. The fact that we share a currency forces us to be more coherent in our economic and social choices. The time when countries could set an atypical rate of taxation or specific social rules without first consulting their partners is long gone. The reason for this is simple: all countries should benefit from the solidarity of their eurozone partners. Yet our people will only accept this solidarity if they think that everyone is putting the same effort into managing public funds. In this respect, the euro pact is a major step forwards towards the convergence of our economies. My group strongly supports it, but demands – and I shall continue to demand – that it is implemented in the context of the Community method, under the auspices of the Commission, Mr President. You are taking the right steps, you have done some good work, but more needs to be done within this Community method under the auspices of the Commission. That is how we will build Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, you know how stubborn I can be and I will repeat it as many times as necessary here so that no one forgets. Europe sets itself apart from the rest of the world with its model of the social market economy, a model which our fellow citizens are quite rightly proud of and which is based on the principle of solidarity, but one which is difficult to preserve in the face of globalisation. The question is knowing how to ensure its future is sustainable by striking a happy medium between the nanny state favoured by socialists, which we have seen almost bankrupt us, and that of excessive liberalism, the dangers of which we have seen with the financial crisis. Three things are needed to achieve this. Firstly, all our countries need to reduce their deficit; secondly, they need to adopt comparable budgetary, fiscal and social rules; and, thirdly, they need to invest together in innovation to boost growth, which to date is clearly inadequate. Indeed, we can only preserve and strengthen our model if we invest in growth sectors: green energy, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, and so on. Given our limited financial room for manoeuvre, the best way to meet the growth challenge and achieve economies of scale is to pool our skills as well as our capital. Without massive investment in innovation, without a genuine European plan, we are denying ourselves the ability to keep up with our competitors. Ladies and gentlemen, while our Heads of State or Government were meeting, 10 days ago, the Fukushima power station continued to be an issue of global concern and the insurgents in Libya were looking to Europe for strong action. On these two matters, our countries and the European Union have shown a great sense of responsibility. We have in fact offered Japan our nuclear expertise in what is an extremely difficult and worrying situation for that country, and also for the international community at large. There will no doubt be a pre-Fukushima and a post-Fukushima. Although unfortunately not there yet, my group wants the post-Fukushima to be a period of reflection and action, firstly to ensure that the rules governing nuclear safety are significantly tightened and, secondly, to further our efforts in the field of green energy. I agree with your approach to Côte d'Ivoire, Mr President. Turning lastly to the Mediterranean, I welcome the European Council’s repeated call for Colonel Gaddafi to relinquish power, allowing for a new page in this country’s history. What I want is for all our countries to come together and discuss a neighbourhood policy as ambitious and successful for the South as the one they were able to make in the 1990s for the East. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would simply like to tell Mr Cohn-Bendit that, in order to challenge a seat, an official proposal must firstly be made. If no proposal is made, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot analyse the situation. Before intervening in this way, I suggest that you think before you act. That is all. (Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit: ‘Yes, but he might not have a seat’)
 You are the one asking me to observe the law. I have always observed the law. Now let us leave it to the Committee on Legal Affairs to give its verdict. It cannot give its verdict without a proposal. If that proposal is not lawful, the Committee on Legal Affairs will tell us. Let me say again: let us think before we act. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is preparing to meet for the second week running amid a climate of international uncertainty and tensions. There is the uncertainty in Japan, where the level of human loss is still difficult to determine, and uncertainty in the Mediterranean, as further populations rise up against their regimes, in Bahrain and as you mentioned President-in-Office of the Council, in Yemen. Inevitably, all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe. Our fellow citizens have witnessed Japan’s drama unfolding live. On top of the empathy we feel for the thousands of families shattered by grief, as we speak there are fears associated with the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the dread of the dangers that we too could face in a similar or comparable situation. These events should certainly be taken on board by all countries that have nuclear power plants and it is good that this Parliament is organising a debate on nuclear safety, though we should not lose sight of the fact that in Europe we need to be increasing and not reducing our energy independence. This is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session. This weekend, the 27 Heads of State or Government will also be discussing the UN decision to intervene in Libya to save the insurgents from imminent attack by the regime. I would like to highlight the fact that European States have taken the initiative in these operations and were the first to intervene within the framework of the UN mandate, which itself was the initiative of several European States. No doubt they heard what us MEPs said during our last part-session here in Brussels. My group would like to see the Council take this opportunity to further develop the EU’s Mediterranean strategy, whilst maintaining the goal to help and support but never to impose. This is our duty as neighbours. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following last week’s euro area summit, at which the groundwork was done, the Council’s flagship measures this week will relate to strengthening the euro and making progress on economic governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of increasing the funds available to support the euro and of making the ad hoc instrument we adopted last year to help Greece and Ireland more permanent. This political will reflects the responsible attitude that Member States have taken in managing this unprecedented crisis in our single currency’s history. However, we wish to stress very strongly that these exceptional circumstances that the loss of control of national public finances has brought about must not be seen by the Council as an opportunity to adopt a different method for managing European affairs. The Community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception. A very strong majority within Parliament supports this principle and the Barroso Commission also supports us in this approach, quite simply because it is vital for the future of the European Union. I am sure that President Van Rompuy will succeed in persuading the Heads of State or Government of this. The Pact for the euro should also be adopted on Friday. We welcome it insofar as it introduces provisions for which we have been calling for months now, namely convergence between Member States’ budgetary, social and fiscal policies. I cannot stress this enough: European solidarity will only be accepted by our citizens if they feel it is fair and deserved. This will only be the case if the working conditions are met and if our businesses can invest and recruit under comparable fiscal conditions. Lastly, our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament’s position as co-legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion. Europe must get back on the path of growth and employment, and the measures that are taking shape are a step in this direction. Provided they are planned within a Community framework, they will give Europe a healthy basis for a fresh start and a promising future. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal. Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments – all the amendments – requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members. Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts. The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament. My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world? Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law? (Applause)
 In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes? The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality. Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores? (Applause)
 Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same. The credibility of Parliament is at stake. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what lessons have we learnt from the financial crisis? The lesson we learnt from the Second World War was that our nations should work together and stop tearing each other apart. From the fall of the Berlin Wall, we learnt lessons about authoritarian and communist regimes and we were able to reunite our continent around the values of freedom, democracy and the social market economy. From the terrorist attack of 11 September, we learnt that we had to strike a new balance between security and freedom. From this financial crisis, the lesson we must learn is for our Member States to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary, fiscal and social fields. I know exactly how far we have come. The establishment, this year, of cooperation between the 27 on their budgetary priorities constitutes, in itself, a major shift in attitude. The regulations that we have provided ourselves with to make the financial markets more ethical are, also, exemplary, but they do not suffice. My group would like to call for an agreement to be reached between Parliament and the Council, before the summer, on strengthened economic governance. My group would also like to call for efforts to be pursued on the coordination of social and fiscal matters. That is the thrust of the competitiveness pact, the initial version of which has already been revised to be in greater accordance with Community values. However, we must go even further still and ensure that both Parliament and the Commission exercise all the prerogatives that they enjoy in this respect, and in this, we are counting on the President of the Commission. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes and supports these proposals as did the national leaders of the party in Helsinki. Ladies and gentlemen, how can we explain to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as we are in a delicate financial situation in mid-July each year, most of our Member States should continue to spend as if nothing were amiss? How can it be that the over-indebtedness of our States is more acceptable, more tolerable and more bearable than that of households or businesses? I have witnessed this at company level. The crisis has led to job losses and family trauma; the least we can do is to learn lessons from this and tell things as they are. The first lesson is that we should no longer treat lightly the obligations placed on States – whatever their size – to respect budget limits. The second lesson is this: European solidarity can only operate if, and only if, our social and fiscal regulations are at least comparable. They do not necessarily need to be identical – just comparable. At the moment, this is far from being the case. The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy. The fourth and final lesson is that even in a storm, Europe is standing firm and European integration is becoming stronger. Our American and Japanese partners have debt ratios far in excess of ours, without, it must be said, being excessively worried by it. However, that will probably not always be the case. For our part, now is the time to consolidate our economy and our competitiveness. Now is the time to work on creating jobs for the future. Now is the time to tell things as they are. Let us not miss this opportunity! Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, there is something that I do not understand. Last week, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we would be holding a debate on Russia in March because Baroness Ashton would be present. Secondly, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we needed to organise a debate on Russia because Mr Putin was going to visit the Commission, or rather Mr Barroso. According to the information I have received this afternoon, Mr Putin is not coming to see the Commission. Do you have any information on this issue? The debate was requested last week only because Mr Putin was coming. However, a debate on Russia, together with a resolution, is still scheduled for March. I should now like to receive some information concerning what we discussed. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what will the European public take away from the meeting of its leaders this Friday in Brussels? Will it understand that European responses to European challenges – the euro, energy, research and innovation and employment – are being sought in good faith? Or rather that, once again, we are surrendering to the sorry spectacle of division and power struggles? What headlines will the major newspapers run? What will people be talking about on Saturday in blogs and on Facebook when they refer to the European Council’s decisions? About the timidity of Europe when faced with the situation of Mediterranean countries which long to have their rights respected, or, on the contrary, about its leadership? Europe’s duty in this regard is quite clear: it must harness all its resources and all its diplomatic skills to aid the transition and the organisation of democratic and open elections. Ladies and gentlemen, as far as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the solution to our problems lies in having more Europe, not less. The solution does not lie in more so-called national victories, but in more common victories and more coordinated responses. The solution does not lie in a lax attitude towards applying our common rules, but in greater discipline. The solution, ladies and gentlemen, does not lie in greater divergences between our budgets, our labour laws and our taxation rates, but in greater convergence. As far as the PPE Group is concerned, there is but one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, which is that, without a common vision and without shared resources, our countries will sink into sluggish growth and plunge into social crisis. If there is just one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is that, by thinking, working and investing as Europeans, our countries will emerge from the difficult patch they are going through and will be forever stronger for it. What else will make us react as one if not the difficulties that we have just experienced? Together with the European Commission, the majority of my colleagues in this House and, I am sure, the majority of the 500 million Europeans, I put the following question to the European Council: when are we going to act and react more as one? As for the euro, I now know that that our governments will hold fast and will not allow speculators to destroy 60 years of European integration. I now call on them to concentrate on the consolidation of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, as this is essential. I call on them in particular to strengthen their budgetary discipline and to keep up their efforts to reduce public debt. European governance is the sine qua non
 of the success of our common project. My group supports it as much as it supports the euro, that is to say, totally. The solution to our problems, as I said at the beginning of my speech, is to have more Europe, not less. While this is true in the cases of employment and the economy, it is also true for energy, a topic which the Council will also cover on Friday. Having more Europe means, first and foremost, fully implementing the laws that already exist in relation to the internal energy market. It can never be emphasised enough that making this market fully operational will make us more competitive, will ensure the security of our supplies and will guarantee a substantial increase in renewable energy production. Having more Europe also means encouraging our States to meet the challenge of increasing their energy efficiency by 20% between now and 2020. They were the ones that set themselves this objective. We must ensure that they reach it, or else we shall have to raise the standards they have to meet to do so. Finally, having more Europe in the field of energy means investing more. The Commission estimates that it will cost EUR 1 billion to reach the required infrastructure level. We expect ambitious decisions from the European Council in order to achieve this. Europe needs secure, clean energy just as much as it needs a research and development policy and a policy for promoting industrial innovation. Here too, the solution lies in having more Europe and paying more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The solution lies in reducing bureaucracy to a minimum and finally reaching an agreement on a European patent. In the area of innovation, too, we expect common solutions from our leaders, not parochial squabbles. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to move on from our knee-jerk reactions of the past. Promoting our differences is all well and good, but making them mutually complementary is even better. Taking individual initiatives can be useful, but playing as a team is the way to win the match. Harbouring national ambitions is perfectly legitimate, but understanding that the game is won at international level by playing as a team is the way to guarantee a future for the people of Europe. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the last European Council clearly showed that the euro is a vital pillar of European integration. Everything possible must be done to stabilise and strengthen it. Our Heads of State or Government have since confirmed their deep attachment to the European currency and the fact that Estonia is joining the euro area at the beginning of this year is yet another signal in this direction, as well as setting a very good example of how to respect standards to the major countries that fail to respect them. That said, no one underestimates the seriousness of what Europe is going through economically and socially within the euro area. Everything possible must be done in 2011 to overcome these problems and to reassure the markets, not superficially but structurally, in other words, by creating the right conditions for growth and employment in the long term. I think we are speaking the same language on this issue. Firstly, this means that national public finances must be restored to better health. Push hard for this, let us not give in! Secondly, it means that the Member States must get their fiscal policies to converge more closely, and also their taxation and social policies. It also means that we must come to a swift agreement on the euro area bail-out fund and that this fund only makes sense if it is backed up by strict enforcement of the fiscal discipline rules. Our citizens must know that the countries they are assisting in difficult circumstances are keeping a very strong check on their public accounts; otherwise, they will no longer agree to stump up, if I may put it that way. Finally, as I said, we must create the conditions for growth and employment. That also implies completing the European internal market, investing more in research and innovation, and in lifelong education and training. My group wants the EU approach to be promoted over the intergovernmental approach in all these areas, quite simply because it is far more effective and far more sustainable. Mr Van Rompuy, I call on you to ensure that reform of the Treaty, confirmed at the last European Council, be concluded as soon and as swiftly as possible. The budget debate is only just beginning. My group will continue to call for a thorough review of European public finances in forthcoming years, with the aim of once again creating the conditions for growth and employment in Europe. Mr Barroso, let us scrutinise everything, let us not be afraid and, as I have already said several times, let us take two or three different examples of budgets: for example, how can we pull Europe out of its current situation with 1%, 2% or 5%? We will not succeed by reducing resources. If we want to create jobs, we need more European resources, and this does not mean that the Member States have to spend more money. Let us not be afraid, President van Rompuy and President Barroso. Put these proposals to us and we, the Heads of State or Government, as well as Parliament, will be forced to find the right solution – but at least let us have a number of options from which to choose. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, rarely will the Presidency of the Council of Ministers have had to face so many challenges: the challenge of the euro, which we must stabilise, the challenge of employment, which is experiencing stronger growth and therefore a more efficient economy, the challenge of energy independence and food security, while prices for raw materials are rising alarmingly. I have no doubt that the Hungarian Presidency will be able to deal with these challenges, alongside the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Mr Orbán, you have won the confidence of your electorate in Hungary. Your party, Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége (FIDESZ), is based on an idea, on an ideal, on a value: that of liberty and democracy. Since your election, you have, with the Hungarian Parliament, undertaken a whole series of reforms which your people have called for by democratically giving you a large majority. Today, one of those reforms – the one concerning the media – is the subject of legal scrutiny by the European Commission, guardian of the Treaties. You yourself stated last week – and I thank you for doing so – during your talks with Mr Barroso, and since then, that were this law incompatible with European law, you would submit it to your parliament for the necessary changes. I have complete faith in your word. For my part, I, like you, have confidence in the European Commission, which plays its role as guardian of the Treaties, and I also have confidence that you will respect the letter and the spirit of the European rules. Prime Minister Orbán, we have known each other for a long time and I consider you a very great European. For my part, I have no reason to doubt that you will do what you have said with regard to the media law and to the other priorities faced by your Presidency. I now come to those priorities, beginning with the first: the stability of Europe. Perhaps it is a good thing that the two presidencies of the Council that will follow one another in 2011 will be assumed by countries that do not belong to the euro area but which wish to join it in the very near future. Indeed, both Hungary and Poland are both entitled to join it. They therefore have a stake in ensuring the stability of this currency. I repeat: the only effective way of ending the speculative attacks against the euro and of strengthening the fundamentals of the European economy is to restore order to our public finances. This involves stronger coordination of fiscal and social policies in our countries, as is quite rightly provided for by the new budgetary period for the European Semester. It also depends on greater flexibility in our employment market and greater productivity. Like the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) firmly believes that the future of 500 million Europeans depends on a stronger, more united and more coherent Europe. It depends on having more of a Europe and certainly not less of a Europe. Mr Orbán, we need European economic governance. We need more communitarianism and I am sure that you will work towards this. President-in-Office of the Council, you have defined the setting up of a common energy policy as one of your main priorities. I think you are right. Mr Buzek, our President, has also, quite rightly, made it one of the strengths of his Presidency. I agree with you on this point, but I also want to warn you about the terribly worrying consequences that may result from the increase in the prices of all kinds of raw materials which has been particularly sharp over the last few months. We have already seen the social implications in several Mediterranean countries of such a price rise in basic foodstuffs, especially for the poorest countries. I hope that Europe will take this problem seriously and deal forcefully with speculators. I also hope that the Hungarian Presidency – I thought that the Group of the Greens were going to be silent, but I can hear them talking; it is not right, people should be quiet all the way through – will back the Commission in its assistance to Tunisia, which is going through a crucial time and must be supported as it moves towards change. Mr Orbán, you know that to succeed in your mandate and help Europe through its current difficult phase, you need the confidence of Parliament. In December, when we were in a difficult position with regard to the Council, you had the courage to sign the first-rate letters for us which really helped Parliament to approve its budget. Thank you, already, for what you did in December! Even before January, you included the political groups when defining your priorities, and naturally chose Mrs Győri, one of our very fine former colleagues, as Minister for EU Affairs. These are all positive signs which, I have no doubt, will be accompanied by a perfect balance between the reforms you are undertaking and the European values that every one of us here defends. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council, which opens this week, is taking place in a particular context: speculative attacks against the euro, the revival of euroscepticism and the beginning of reflections on Europe’s finances, while this Parliament is preparing to vote on the 2011 budget. These are, of course, closely linked. The euro crisis and the solidarity measures have an impact on the purchasing power of the European people, who are wondering if all these efforts are worthwhile, if they are leading to anything, whence the euroscepticism even in countries hitherto traditionally pro-European. This is a phenomenon hijacked by populist and extremist political factions, which feed on fear and the temptation to withdraw into oneself and which, when they are in government, do not have a miracle cure. I will start with the euro, which we must protect and strengthen while, at the same time, asking ourselves some fundamental questions. My first question is this: has Europe ever had a currency as stable as the euro? I say this to those nostalgic for national currencies: a step back would have catastrophic consequences for Europe. My second question is: who is behind the attacks to which the euro has been subjected for months? Who is standing to gain from the crime, if I may call it that? I am not a conspiracy theorist but, in my conversations with political leaders and financial analysts, the paths are converging on the source of our problems. When will we learn? I think we can talk directly to our friends. My third question is this: why is the euro still trading above USD 1.30? This is seriously hampering our exports and everyone is saying that the euro has had it. Why are our countries the only ones to practise a strict policy of orthodoxy while our competitors profit from their weak currencies to boost their economies? This is what our citizens are asking us. These are questions I have been asked in the last two weeks in meetings with elected politicians. Ladies and gentlemen, what we need is a message of confidence that we will overcome the crisis, measures to encourage a return to growth and concrete measures like those taken recently by the Barroso Commission to relaunch the internal market or to make the financial markets more ethical. What we need, and the euro crisis proved this, is convergence in our social and fiscal policies. That takes courage. President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, go further and faster and we will solve quite a few problems. We are going to need a lot of courage in the years to come if we want to strengthen our countries in the arena of global competition and if we want to use taxpayers’ money in the most effective way possible. This effort to streamline expenditure must be made at all levels: local, regional, national and European. The political and financial priorities of the Union need to be reexamined and the public finances of Europe need to be fundamentally reviewed. We need to ask ourselves the real questions and, depending on the answers we give, adapt our budgetary framework for the period 2014-2020. It is for this crucial debate that the European Parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that, as the representatives directly elected by 500 million Europeans, we intend to fully participate, even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right. I ask the European Council to give us its agreement and, if necessary, to vote, so that those who deny us this opportunity to participate in the debate assume their responsibilities. It is not, for us, about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction. We must lance the boil, we must take the right decisions, the necessary decisions to ensure that the European budget increasingly becomes an investment budget. If our Member States, mindful of budgetary constraints, can invest less in education, training, research and innovation, let us do so at European level by combining our resources and, therefore, by achieving economies of scale. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the debate on Europe’s finances must not be allowed to descend into a quarrel between Member States who want their money back. On the contrary, the debate should be about reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe by exposing them to the added value that concerted and visionary European action can represent. I am currently visiting the capital cities and I can tell you that the debate is taking hold. Do not miss this opportunity. Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end, I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament, as well as José Manuel Barroso, who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June. I believe that we must continue, together, in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us. We have to show them the way. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an opinion poll I read yesterday in a newspaper states that 70% of French people believe that they are still in the midst of a crisis and that it has not yet been resolved. I am sure that a broader survey in Europe would generate the same results. We must therefore address our citizens’ valid concerns. They are living in difficult times and cannot tolerate the slow and complex decision-making process at European and global level. Many of these people have also asked me what we are doing and what Europe is doing for them and their family. People are scared. At the same time, I see that more and more politicians and more and more countries, even in this House, are using, manipulating and exploiting this fear and this anxiety and do not have any proposals. This populist approach, which is corrupting our policy, is serious, and I should like to mention here that this is not the way to resolve the real and serious problems facing our countries and Europe in the world. I believe that it is up to the political parties and the parliamentary groups that are against such populism and demagogy to speak out more. No, the answer to the crisis is not to shy away from it or resort to protectionism. No, there is no fast or easy solution to the crisis we are facing. No, it is not possible to turn our back on solidarity or on efforts to strengthen all our countries in the face of globalisation and then realise, in the end, that we need partners when times are tough. We must learn some lessons from what is happening in Ireland, and this is not a criticism of Ireland, President of the Council, President of the Commission. We must learn lessons, because the difficulties that that country is facing are due not only to the banks but also to the current government’s fiscal and economic policy over the years. The Celtic Tiger, which was solely responsible for its own growth, with an atypical tax system, minimal banking regulation and an investment code unlike that of any other country in the European Union, is today witnessing a collapse of its property bubble, household debt, record unemployment and a crippled banking sector. The Irish Government has guaranteed the whole banking system, committing EUR 480 billion, or three times its GDP, which increases its public deficit to 32%. Today, the Irish Government has called for and rightly obtained European solidarity. I welcome this and, as Commissioner Rehn said in this very Parliament on Monday, the aid Ireland should soon receive will safeguard the stability of the whole euro area. Yet has this European solidarity, which Dublin is rightly receiving today, as it did when it joined the EU, been shown over the years by the Irish Government itself? How many times have Member States tried to align taxation – a prerequisite, as is all too evident today, for good governance of the euro? And every time the same few countries oppose it. I am not pointing the finger at anyone, but I believe that it is time for us to learn from such behaviour for the future. As I have said several times in this House, a crisis signifies an opportunity for change, and we must not be afraid to change some of our customs, which have not had the positive effect we were counting on. Ladies and gentlemen, the measures adopted by the European Council a few weeks ago and the guidelines agreed at the G20 in Seoul represent a step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. In other words, there needs to be an awareness of the need for cooperation in Europe and among major regional blocs in order to address the instability of financial markets and trade imbalances and also to avoid a currency war. We all know that, on all these issues, our countries alone will be unable to find a viable long-term solution to meet the expectations of the 500 million Europeans, who, as I said at the beginning, are expecting their politicians – that is to say all of us here and back home in our capitals – to make forward-looking decisions. President of the Council, if the crisis has taught us anything, it is that yesterday’s solutions are not necessarily those of tomorrow. We are paying a high price realising this in a time of crisis, but we will pay an even higher price if we continue to ignore it. I call on the European institutions and the governments of our Member States to change, to learn political lessons from the crisis, and to stop seeking solidarity only when it is too late. Mr President, I would like to add one last thing. This is not a question of the Council and Parliament fighting against one another; it is a question of implementing the treaties, of showing solidarity, and of working hand in hand. This is the message I should like to get across to you so that we might overcome the crisis for the sake of our fellow citizens. Joseph Daul  (PPE
).

 Mr President, if I may, what I said this morning is that Mr Bloom has behaved unacceptably. Secondly, we are in a democratic parliament. We have decided democratically, Mr Bloom, that you should leave this Parliament. I hereby ask you, in the name of democracy and of all this Parliament stands for, to leave this Parliament today. I ask you to do so out of respect for democratic rights. Mr Gollnisch, you do not need to challenge me. We know your methods. They are unacceptable, anti-democratic. That is all I have to say to you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last Conference of Presidents, we decided to put the Matera report on today’s agenda. No one asked for that report not to be put on the agenda. Therefore, the question asked by the President is as follows: faced with an individual such as this, are we going to be able to have frank discussions, as we have been used to having for five years? That is the question I am going to ask on Thursday morning. Moreover, if the European Conservatives and Reformists continue to make this person participate in the Conference of Presidents, we are going to change the way we work. That is all I have to say. Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR) 
Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the budget comes at a time when our fellow citizens are having doubts because of the weakness of their currency and when Europe is rightly rallying in support of the Irish economy. Contrary to what may have been said about the European Parliament’s objectives in these negotiations, this is not about power struggles or institutional disputes, nor is it about ignoring the difficulties faced by our Member States or the public debt crisis from which we are all suffering. No, it is about ensuring that Europe can honour its commitments. Commitments in the social sphere, and here I am thinking of education and lifelong learning; commitments to the victims of natural disasters, and here I am thinking of assistance for countries affected by food riots; and commitments to programmes that create jobs and growth, such as Galileo and ITER. The reality is that, by looking at things from an accounting point of view rather than from a political point of view, the few Member States that continue to block the negotiations are harming the interests of the 500 million Europeans. By making the European Parliament out to be the villain of the piece, and by suggesting that it wants to spend at a time when the Member States are tightening their belts, that it wants to exercise the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon to the detriment of saving and of Europeans, they are diverting attention from the reality of the problems that exist. What is that reality? It is that the latest economic forecasts offer no hope of a return, by 2020, to the strong, sustainable and inclusive growth that the European Union set itself as an objective. It is also a fact that the current draft budget makes no provision for the financing of the new powers conferred on the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon and fails to fulfil our requests to proceed with the mid-term review of the financial cycle laid down in the 2007-2013 agreement. Lastly, it is a fact that the draft budget makes no – and I mean no – financial provision for the 2020 strategy. In short, the Council is adopting programmes without making any financial provision for them. Moreover, when the President of the European Parliament reminds it of its obligations, it takes offence, but when a local, regional or national authority approves projects without financing them, that authority is condemned. Why, I ask you, would something that is unacceptable at local or national level be acceptable at European level? Is this a way of reconciling our citizens with Europe? I do not think so. I say clearly to the Commission and, above all, to the Council: do not count on my group, do not count on this House voting for programmes that do not have guaranteed funding. My group wants a return to common sense and a balanced agreement to be reached. It must be a comprehensive agreement that relates, at the same time, to the 2011 budget, the 2010 amending budget and its associated letters of amendment, the flexibility procedure and, finally, the guarantees regarding the financing of future policies, which we call the political section. I would stress that our proposals on this political section do not involve any changes to the current treaties, nor do they anticipate in any way the amount, origin or distribution of future EU funds. I would also stress that reopening the debate on own resources is not a new proposal by Parliament, but a decision taken by the Council itself in May 2006, following the agreement reached in December 2005 under the UK Presidency. My group fully supports the objective not only of capping but also of reducing the Member States’ budget contributions. Indeed, the extremely serious nature of the debt crisis must lead to a complete overhaul of European public finances. This is not just about dividing up tasks between national budgets and European budgets; it is also about seeking out all possible forms of mutualisation in order to make savings. Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the two demands made by the Council on 15 October: for the EU budget to contribute to common financial discipline and for the funding of European objectives to be guaranteed. That is all we are aiming for in the negotiations on the 2011 budget, and we are confident that an agreement can be reached if the Council Presidency negotiates effectively with its colleagues in Brussels. (Applause) Joseph Daul,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common thread between the meetings of the European Council and the G20 is the need to make the necessary adaptations after the financial crisis. For the European Union, these adaptations consist of putting our respective national and EU public finances in order and protecting our currency, the euro, by consolidating it internally and defending its value against the other major currencies. The European Council will be dominated by discussions on Europe’s economic and financial governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the initial lines that the Van Rompuy task force has taken, including the plans for a system of sanctions against Member States that do not adhere to the criteria of the Stability Pact. However, there is still more work to be done, with more Community method and less intergovernmental method. I welcome the work that the Commission has done along these lines. I would ask the Council to remember that this Parliament is now colegislator and will play a full role in defining the forthcoming reforms. The more Parliament is brought on board in the early stages, the more chance we have of achieving a satisfactory and timely outcome. I call on President Van Rompuy to heed this message. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must make its voice heard in the debate on relative currency values, and the European Council must establish our position on the subject next week, before the Seoul G20 summit. Europe must join with its partners, in particular, the United States, in reminding the emerging countries of their responsibilities. Currency dumping and the social consequences it entails must no longer be allowed. Three major subjects will be on the table at the Seoul Summit: reform of the international monetary system of course, but also the stability of commodities – especially food and energy – and global governance. Europe has a message to deliver on each of these subjects, but this message will only be credible if we put in place effective internal, Community-wide instruments to govern and manage our public finances. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to influence global governance and will not really have a place on the international stage unless we can make the often unpopular effort to clean up our finances and unless we stick to our priorities of combating climate change and development policy. (Applause) Joseph Daul  (PPE

 Mr President, yesterday evening, my group discussed amendments that the services have told us are unacceptable. As a result, and following the discussion I had this morning with the heads of delegation and the group leaders, I request that the vote on the calendar be postponed. Joseph Daul,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2011 budget is the first budget that this Parliament is called on to negotiate and vote on using its new powers under the Treaty of Lisbon. It is the first in which we have desisted from calling for any increase in the global volume proposed by the Commission, instead preferring a realistic and political approach. A realistic approach insofar as our Member States have been called upon to make unprecedented efforts in stabilising and reducing their public finances. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the first to call upon them to do so. The reduction in public expenditure is, effectively, the prerequisite if our economies are to become more competitive and face up to international competition under favourable conditions. It is therefore not a question of our asking of the twenty-seven, for this budgetary year, expenditure which does not fit within the efforts made by our fellow citizens within their own national framework. However, our approach is also political insofar as we believe that the 2011 budget cannot be disassociated from the more general financial context of the years to come and, in particular, from the perspective of the next 2014-2020 financial cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, if there is an objective that our Parliament must aim for in the course of this legislature, it is to ensure that European policies are funded in a manner commensurate with what is at stake. It is not necessarily a question of asking for more money but rather to ensure that the tasks assigned to the European Union can be achieved with adequate funding. Our States can even economise, reduce their contribution to the Community budget, if they are prepared for Europe to change its financial system, as it is now obsolete, and take advantage of own resources. A euro spent at European level is, indeed, more profitable, more productive than a euro spent at national level, because a European euro does not have a deficit to cover. At national level, the euro is now worth only half or less in some countries. At national level too, this euro which has not already been reduced comes back in the shape of cohesion funds, funds for rural development and for promoting innovation. I request that the Council gives serious consideration to this new approach to European finance. I am grateful to Commissioner Lewandowski for already having opened this debate with our ministers of finance. Europeans have the right to know what their public authorities spend, whether these be local, regional, national or European. Member States must be ready to lift this gauntlet. President of the Council, Ministers, you have in your own hands the key to unlocking these debates and negotiations so that all the Member States can move forward, so that the euro that is at the level of Brussels can return to the level of the citizens in the Member States and be much more productive and create new jobs at a European level. I beg you, the opportunity is still there. As a Christmas present, you must tell us that the own funds and own resources of Europe are starting to be the subject of serious discussion and serious negotiation under your Presidency. I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this.Dominique Baudis  (PPE
),

 This report sends a clear message: the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy. The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes. A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world. Culture is a significant asset. It contributes to a living and long-lasting democracy. Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society. Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union’s success for the Mediterranean. It leads nations to share and interact with one another, respect and better understand each other every day.

Mr President, the European Union has finally imposed sanctions on Syria. Unfortunately, however, it appears to have done so with some trepidation, taking care to avoid calling the head of the Syrian regime into question. This lack of determination and clarity is obviously interpreted by the demonstrators as a form of abandonment and by the authorities as an indulgence enabling them to step up their repression, a repression so cruel that it is unimaginable that Syria may be elected to sit on the UN’s Human Rights Council when the country’s authorities are right now refusing UN observers access to the city of Deraa, the scene of terrible violence against unarmed civilians. Having Syria on the Human Rights Council would be an insult to the victims and their families, and an encouragement for that regime to use brute force against its own people, with complete disregard for the values that the Human Rights Council is supposed to uphold. So, Baroness Ashton, what diplomatic options do you have in mind in order to avoid such a disaster? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I supported this resolution because I am convinced that the European Union’s desire to bolster its presence within international organisations is entirely legitimate. European citizens, through our governments, have given a legal personality and specific powers to the Union. European integration has built on a set of fundamental values that are constantly being extended. We have a duty to coordinate our activities and to promote the unity of our Union, as we have already done in the World Trade Organisation. More work remains to be done. However, there are some encouraging signs. The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools (appointment of a High Representative, creation of the European External Action Service). With its newly improved status, the Union will now be able to express its position within the United Nations General Assembly. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 This report provides a good overview of the current state of relations between the European Union and Iceland. Ever since the Treaty of Paris, we have maintained friendly, close and cooperative links with that country. It has been hard hit by the economic, financial and banking crisis. Reforms must be undertaken, and we must encourage them. Since the start of the accession process, we have begun an open and constructive dialogue with the Icelandic Government, which has also expressed a desire to join the euro area. Enlargement to include Iceland will allow for greater European policy coherence in the Arctic region, especially where fisheries, maritime transport, scientific research and environmental conservation are concerned. However, Europe is not a crutch or a cure for an economic crisis. It is up to Iceland to clearly subscribe to a genuine project of integration with the rest of Europe. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 We need to rethink our policy on the Southern Mediterranean. The European Neighbourhood Policy was supposed to promote the values of democracy and human rights, yet the events that have been taking place in the Southern Mediterranean since the start of the year show that we failed on that score. Admittedly, cooperation in areas such as education and modernisation of the economy has borne fruit. The same cannot be said of good governance, judicial reform and democracy, which are nonetheless headline objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This text has the merit of proposing solutions for radically rethinking this policy. I hope that the European Commission and the Council will be able to take inspiration from it.

The resolution on the situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen rightly denounces the brutal and murderous repression whose victims are the demonstrators in Syria, as well as those in Yemen and Bahrain. The leaders of these three countries are giving orders to fire on their own people, who are legitimately demanding political freedom, human dignity and social fairness. Through this resolution, the European Parliament is strongly expressing its solidarity with the Syrian, Bahraini and Yemeni citizens, who are showing great courage in demonstrating their aspirations while faced with government forces who are opening fire on unarmed civilians.

 I voted in favour of this text on migratory flows. Indeed, the events that our southern neighbours are currently going through are resulting in high levels of migration to European shores. Now more than ever, we have to coordinate our foreign and immigration policies. This is a truly European issue and now is not the time for national egoism. The Mediterranean countries of the European Union should not have to cope alone with the large influx of illegal migrants: this effort should be shared by all EU countries. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament’s clear position. We encourage the Commission to fight violence against women. Of course, there are preventive and repressive legal mechanisms in all the Member States. However, it is also the responsibility of Europe to take up this issue, which falls within its remit. It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis. Dominique Baudis,

 Mr President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels, Mrs Brantner and Mrs Jäätteenmäki, with whom we prepared these amendments. Thanks to the amendments, we have a report that fully accounts for the events taking place in the Gulf, and which states very clearly Parliament’s position on the repression afflicting that region. The first amendment, 16th new citation, is as follows: ‘- having regard to the declarations by the High Representative of 10, 15 and 17 March, and the Council conclusions of 21 March on Bahrain and underlining in this context its full support for the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to peacefully demonstrate,’ This is the first amendment, and it is of course the English-language version, which has been distributed, that is deemed authentic. Dominique Baudis,  (PPE

The second amendment, recital A, is as follows: ‘Whereas current EU-GCC relations require constant reviewing and updating in view of recent important and rapidly unfolding developments on the ground, which are evolving rapidly, at the heart of which needs to be the pursuit of human rights and democracy.’ Dominique Baudis,  (PPE
) 
. – (FR)
 A new recital A bis: ‘A bis. Whereas demonstrators have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations in several GCC States; whereas the violent reaction of the authorities to the protests in Bahrain resulted in deaths, injuries and imprisonments; whereas Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti troops have arrived in the country under the banner of the GCC to participate in the repression of demonstrators,’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 In paragraph 7, after the first paragraph, the first indent should now read: ‘- ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, with special regard to the freedom of speech and of assembly and the right to demonstrate peacefully, and to listen to and take into account the legitimate demands of protesters as well as to ensure their security;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7a: ‘7a. Calls on all Member States in the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognise a continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region, and calls for the full engagement with emerging civil society groups to promote a process of genuine peaceful democratic transition, within their own countries, with partners in the region and with the full support of the European Union;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 7b: ʻ7b. Expresses its deep concern at the violent response of and the use of force against protesters by Bahraini authorities and at the participation of foreign troops under the GCC banner in the repression of demonstrators; whereas this stands in stark contrast to the GCC’s support for the protection of the citizens demanding freedom and democracy in Libya; calls for an immediate end to violence against peaceful protesters and for a political dialogue that can lead to further necessary political reforms in the country;ʼ Dominique Baudis  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 A new paragraph 18a: ‘18a. Takes note of the declaration by the GCC of 7 March 2011 in Abu Dhabi, which states that “the Ministerial council demands that the Security Council takes the steps necessary to protect civilians, including a no-fly zone in Libya”, which declaration has contributed to the decision of the Arab League and then the United Nations Security Council to pronounce themselves in favour of such a zone;’ Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it expresses the solidarity of the people of Europe with Japan. Parliament is highlighting the courage of the Japanese in this crisis, the most serious since the Second World War, which has so severely affected their country. Among Japan’s friends, Europeans have immediately reported themselves for duty to lend a helping hand to the people afflicted. However, the archipelago is faced with a nuclear problem that is of extreme concern and requires our full attention. It suits Europe to provide all its assistance and expertise to the Japanese authorities in order to prevent a catastrophe of the devastating consequences of which we are unfortunately all too well aware.

 Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for their collaboration. As you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Our work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world. Since then, we have observed everywhere – including in the Gulf – powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. However, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report – and the amendments adopted in committee – raised all the issues that are behind the uprising. We condemn all forms of discrimination – including those founded on gender or religion – we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights. As the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom. We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to take part in the repression, and we express our grave concern in respect of the violent response of those in power. Finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition. Obviously, this report also outlines long-term strategic prospects. It touches on the potential of a partnership in many areas (geopolitics, energy, education and science and in the area of regional integration). From a geopolitical point of view, Iran clearly represents a genuine threat. Between Iran and Israel, the Gulf States would inevitably be the collateral victims of a conflict. These countries expect a lot from us in trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The GCC countries, which make up a quarter of Arab League member states, play a very important role in the peace process. Let us remember that they are behind the Arab peace initiative. With regard to energy, the GCC is the European Union’s leading oil supplier, so the EU is highly dependent on these countries, but their oil reserves are dwindling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy. We can offer our experience in this area. On an educational and scientific level, these countries are making education one of their priorities. Because of the limited number of universities and lecturers, we are seeing units of prestigious American universities being set up. Unfortunately, the European Union, although committed, is very much lagging behind the United States. For example, only eight students from GCC countries came to Europe last year as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme. Finally, in the area of regional integration, the GCC is slow to make progress. Wiser for its experience, the European Union can offer its help, advice and know-how; finally, we call for the signing of a free trade agreement which has been in negotiation for over 20 years.

 I voted for this resolution, which is a step in the right direction as regards the reaction of the European Union to the revolution, which is degenerating into civil war, in Libya. Revolutions are a dream that becomes reality, but civil war is a nightmare. With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi’s troops and mercenaries, and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime, we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them. We have heard the appeal that the Interim Transitional National Council made on 5 March. It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime. With no direct military presence on Libyan soil, a no-fly zone should be considered. But the decision rests with the UN. However, this option could only be envisaged with the explicit consent of the Arab League. At a political and diplomatic level, we have to ensure that Colonel Gaddafi is isolated and help the Libyan people to finally regain their freedom. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The revolutions in the Arab world must not divert our attention from the Middle East peace process. On the contrary, they are an opportunity to be seized. Palestine is due to hold presidential and legislative elections before the summer, and the Palestinian Authority wants to establish legitimate institutions and manage its security. The ongoing construction of Israeli settlements is an injustice and a provocation to the Palestinians. Today, we have the opportunity, with this wind of freedom that is blowing over the whole of the Arab world, to relaunch the negotiations. The EU must take the initiative to relaunch them. Why not do so within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 With this vote, Parliament has reached another milestone on the road towards global financial regulation. We have sent a strong message in favour of the projects of the French Presidency of the G20. When the economy shows its first signs of recovery, we will have to work together to promote a well thought-out, balanced model of liberalism. The European left tried to take sole credit for the idea of taxing financial transactions. It was misguided, however. Europeans know when to be pragmatic. Today’s vote shows that this notion extends beyond all political differences. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which I believe is fair and balanced. The people of Egypt are seeing their legitimate expectations met. Mr Mubarak’s departure is an essential condition, but it is not enough to ensure that Egypt embarks on a path towards democracy and human rights. The transition is being overseen by the army, which has given itself six months to rise to this challenge. During the 18 days of demonstrations that led to this result, Egypt suffered financial losses, and they are becoming worse each day. The European Union must offer its support to Egypt so that the achievements of the revolution are not destroyed by a harsh economic and social crisis. So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results, and this has not done much for the EU’s image. However, our role remains crucial. We should not criticise ourselves unfairly. Revolutions are peculiar in that they always seem inevitable after the fact but impossible before it. However, self-criticism is justifiable, and we are on the right track, since the Council and the Commission have demonstrated their desire to radically rethink the European neighbourhood policy.

The sudden arrival of thousands of migrants on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is an exceptional event. However, this event brings us face to face with a problem which concerns all Europeans. Right now, it is important that European solidarity should function properly. I agree with you, Commissioner, in your appeal to the Member States to deliver urgent aid to Italy, both in terms of goods and in terms of finance. Very often, in these situations, the countries in which migrants arrive are not their final destinations. Reception centres are frequently outdated, and serious tensions sometimes arise in areas where migrants are received. We have already passed some significant milestones in the fight against illegal immigration and in regulating flows. However, in a Union where internal borders have practically disappeared, Europe must equip itself in the long term with the means to achieve its ambitions. It must create a genuine immigration policy, open a constructive dialogue with countries of origin and strengthen the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) in its missions.

 This motion for a resolution reaffirms Europeans’ commitment to the root-and-branch reforms sought by the people of Tunisia. Europe has maintained a special relationship with the people of Tunisia for a long time. It was the only international organisation to introduce clauses relating to respect for human rights and democratic values into its relations with Tunisia. European economic assistance, provided within the context of the neighbourhood policy, has helped to improve the average standard of living, to create employment, to train young people and to provide access for women to positions of responsibility. Europe is today anxious to support the people of Tunisia in the democratic transition that is beginning. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the situation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion, which condemns the deadly attacks against Christians in the East. The attacks against Christians in recent months are a tragedy for the many victims, particularly in Baghdad and Alexandria, but also for their co-religionists. Christians have lived in the East for 2 000 years; they are inscribed in the history of their country. Today, however, they are fleeing the region en masse. Because of this forced exile, these countries are losing a substantial proportion of their human resources. The Near and Middle East regions have always been an area of diversity and cohabitation of religious minorities. The terrorists behind these attacks are trying to instigate a clash between East and West, pitting the Muslim world against the Christian world. All of this has been fiendishly planned. Christians in Iraq and Egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed. It is important that the Egyptian and Iraqi authorities find and harshly judge the authors of these massacres.

 For the next six months, you will hold the Presidency of the Council, and many challenges await you. You are making the exit from the crisis your top priority. I am convinced that under your Presidency, the institutions and the Member States will continue to work well together. It is our duty to ensure the long-term survival of the solidarity and stabilisation mechanisms, which have already shown their worth. In order to achieve our aims, we will also have to focus on reforming the international financial system. We, in Europe, have been the forerunners of the regulation and supervision of the financial markets. The French Presidency of the G20 is an opportunity that must be grasped. A united Europe should set an example to its foreign partners. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a key instrument in the Union’s foreign policy. Thanks to it, we maintain stable relationships with our closest neighbours. The Eastern Partnership, which is one of your priorities, should not be promoted at the expense of the Mediterranean Partnership. The Union for the Mediterranean is losing momentum and is equally deserving of our attention. Europe remains its firm supporter. What do you intend to do to revive it? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The citizens’ initiative is finally to see the light of day. This incredible democratic innovation will lay the foundations for a new European citizenship. It will become the instrument which enables the European public to give direct expression to their concerns on subjects which may be crucial to our common future. The scope for intervention is as important as the extended mandate of the Union. The European Parliament is encouraging rapid, effective implementation. This initiative was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and it still remained to the European institutions to come to an agreement on practical arrangements. The conditions for organising an initiative, which Parliament wanted to be flexible (a million people from at least a quarter of the Member States, which equates to seven countries today), will give citizens concerned all they need to request the Commission to propose a new legislative text. This will become a possibility next year. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 The European Union must grant itself a budget equal to its ambitions. It must not let itself be carried along by the crisis but rise to the challenges it meets. With the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now plays on a level playing field with the Council and has made its mark as a proactive force. I voted for the 2011 budget as it is incumbent on us, as MEPs, to give Europe clear political direction. In 2011 Europe will keep its priorities on target. It will be able to revise upwards its financial needs in order to implement its new powers. Despite difficult economic circumstances, Parliament has managed to win a firm commitment from the Member States. On the proposal of Parliament, in 2011 the Commission will begin discussions on the different types of own resources, resources which Europe needs to guarantee its financial autonomy in the future. However, I am deeply concerned that Parliament has not found a consensus on the additional funding that the ‘Iter’ project will need from 2012. The experimental thermonuclear reactor, a flagship project of international research and European scientific dynamism, could have benefited from an unused and surplus portion of the 2011 budget.

 Looking carefully at the images available on the Internet, one can measure the level of violence used against the Moroccan law enforcement authorities. The scenes witnessed at both the Gdaim Izyk camp and on the road to Laâyoune are evidence of the deadly acts of violence against the Moroccan security services. Not even the emergency vehicles were spared. The reality is very far removed from what the propaganda would have us believe. Our Parliament therefore needs to show restraint and use discretion rather than unduly laying the blame on the Moroccan authorities and holding them fully responsible for this situation.

The financial crisis that the world has gone through has shown that international financial exchanges need to be subject to minimum rules. Having stated in September that it was determined to supervise the markets, the European Parliament has today, 11 November, sent another powerful message to the rest of the world. From now on, alternative investment funds (hedge funds) entering Europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by Europe. What is more, they will have to be declared to the authorities and managed within the European Union. The non-regulation of these resources caused many bankruptcies, stock exchange crashes and social crises. France is about to take over the G20 Presidency for a year. Its main priority will be to reform the international financial system. With this vote, Europe is blazing a trail. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

The financial, economic and social crisis has now been raging for two years. It has resulted in an unemployment rate of more than 10% in the EU and in the risk of a new recession. This is a crisis that we are unable to bring under control. The next G20 summit will take place on 11 and 12 November in Seoul, under the Presidency of France. Establishing the G20 was the brainchild of President Sarkozy, who believes that nowadays, the global economy is no longer regulated by the 8, but by all the major developing countries, too. This framework allows for the development of an ambition grounded in a long-term vision. This crisis demands that we have genuine economic governance, rules restricting social dumping in developing countries, financial regulation, and a reform of the international monetary system. To achieve this, Europe must know how to speak with one strong and determined voice. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 By voting today, Thursday, 7 October 2010 on a resolution, the European Parliament is demanding that the Commission give thought to significantly improving cohesion policy instruments. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion is no longer just economic and social; it is also territorial. Regional policy is one of the spearheads of European integration. It is the second heading in the Union’s budget, after the common agricultural policy. Europe needs to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of its regions. The development of cross-border transport links is one of the major challenges of this policy. One of the priorities in this area is the route across the Pyrenees between France and Spain, which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West. At the moment, the road and rail links do not meet expectations. Some regions, although linked from a socio-economic point of view, do not today enjoy adequate means of communication. The various projects that the Commission is due to carry forward in this geographical area will be carried out in the medium and long terms. They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Cross-border cooperation is essential for our neighbouring countries. How is it possible to have a prosperous and sustainable economy if the borders are closed? It provides better border security and intelligent management of migratory flows. However, some of our neighbouring regions, such as the Maghreb, do not know how to work together. In the majority of cases where cross-border cooperation among our neighbours is at a standstill there is an unfinished conflict with a long history behind it. It is obviously crucial that we give our neighbours the resources to cooperate. However, in order for the budgets allocated to be really useful, we need the European Union, in other words, you, Mr Füle, and especially Baroness Ashton, to be present on the political stage. It needs to be in a position to have an influence, be heard and be respected. Otherwise the Union for the Mediterranean is doomed to failure. In addition, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument creates a multitude of documents and suffers as a result of its complexity or even opacity. Parliament has almost no right to see the strategy documents and national indicative programmes. We must be consulted more often and be better informed, and the procedure must be simplified.

With the new competences that it has acquired since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union needs to rely on strong diplomacy. The European External Action Service (EEAS) represents considerable progress in this respect. I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on the EEAS because, in order to succeed in her mission, the High Representative urgently needs to acquire a competent diplomatic arm. My decision is based on the conclusions of the Madrid Conference of 21 June, where an institutional balance was found. The European interest of the initial draft has been retained. The Commission, the Council and Parliament will now be able to work together to establish an effective and operational European diplomatic service. I am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the EEAS will respect this balance. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you will now hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union for six months. Numerous challenges await you, including the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), one of the major advances in the Treaty of Lisbon. The agreement reached between the various institutions envisages that the Service will be created by January 2011, even though it took more than seven months to negotiate its organisational structure. The actual and effective creation of the EEAS is now a matter of urgency, because the Treaty of Lisbon’s credibility is at stake, together with Europe’s image within the international community. Your experience of negotiating and reaching compromises will help in the actual implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. We wish you every success. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, this attack on civilian ships by Israeli commandos clearly demands an impartial and credible inquiry. However, what confidence can we have in a commission that would be the judge in its own case? This attack took place in international waters; it therefore concerns the international community and it affects Europe in particular, as Europe has a Mediterranean coastline. Europe should make itself heard more and should become more closely involved in the search for a political solution based on two states with each having Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is making significant financial efforts to help develop the Palestinian Territories, but, unfortunately, it is too absent from the political process which should lead to the creation of this Palestinian state. The financial and budgetary goodwill that we are showing is not enough. We must also express political will and give ourselves the means to make ourselves heard. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, in the follow-up to the Barcelona process, the Union for the Mediterranean is an opportunity to develop our relations with the countries to the east and south of the Mediterranean basin. As the excellent report by Vincent Peillon emphasises, we cannot neglect either the potential of this region or the risks which it brings with it. Let us at least have the presence of mind to recognise that, since the bombing of Gaza and with the continuing colonisation of Palestinian territories, the Union for the Mediterranean has been painted into a corner. The political aspect is blocked. We are not even sure if the planned summit in Barcelona in June will actually take place. I would not be surprised if we were to learn in the coming days or hours that it has been postponed indefinitely. However, we should not give up; the European Union should assume greater responsibility in the search for a political solution. We cannot allow the United States to monopolise political crisis management in this region, our region, and confine ourselves to its development. Our security and growth depend on the development and stability of the Mediterranean, which is why the Union for the Mediterranean is still the best instrument at our disposal. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid any caricatures – we have heard one or two this morning – I would like to mention some objective facts regarding Tunisia, a partner country of the European Union. The social situation has evolved very favourably, with a spectacular increase in the average per capita income, and now the vast majority of Tunisians meet the criteria defining membership of the middle class. More than 90% of Tunisians enjoy welfare cover, and more than a quarter of Tunisia’s budget is devoted to education, with the result that the country is one of the very first to have achieved the Millennium Development Goals in the area of primary education. Finally, as Mr Michel highlighted a little while ago, women’s rights are both recognised and guaranteed. At university level, female students outnumber male students, and 40% of teachers are women. A quarter of politicians, local officials and journalists are women. Many countries would be envious of these statistics. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Mr President, the acts of fanatic criminals, who have killed some Christians in Egypt, cannot be ascribed to an entire population and its government. It would be unfair to hold Egypt and the Egyptians responsible for this appalling massacre, for which the perpetrators will be brought to justice. We must not confuse the acts of one criminal with the policy of an entire country! Let us not tar fanatics and an entire population with the same brush. Finally, by seeking to intervene between the Coptic Christians and their fellow Muslim citizens, we are adding fuel to the fire of the extremists, who want to portray Eastern Christians as agents of the West.

 Mr President, for the next six months, you will hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union. Many challenges await you in the field of foreign policy, especially as regards the southern shore of the Mediterranean. What do you intend to do to relaunch the Union for the Mediterranean, the headquarters of which are located in Barcelona? The Secretary General of the Union for the Mediterranean has recently been appointed. How do you envisage your collaboration with the Union for the Mediterranean’s first ever Secretary General?

During the last Foreign Affairs Council, the Council of the European Union made it known that it wanted a Palestinian state to be created in the near future, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is thus outlining the conditions of a viable solution to the Middle East conflict that is acceptable to both parties. The solution proposed by the Council is fair. Israel and Palestine can use it as a basis on which to exchange land for peace. The European Union has a major role to play. It can support inter-Palestinian reconciliation, without which there will be no Palestinian interlocutor in the negotiations with Israel. It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 Mr President, the SESAR programme, which aims to modernise air traffic management in Europe, is a major project. How is the Commission going to prepare for the forthcoming SESAR deployment phase and, in particular, for the financing of this programme, which is essential both for the environment and for our scientific and technical standing? Will the Commission follow the recommendations of the 2007 report, according to which a highly qualified individual should ensure political monitoring of this programme? Indeed, a number of obstacles will have to be overcome – of a legal, psychological and technical nature – to unite national airspaces and to succeed in getting controllers from the various countries to work together. If Europe is not able to create a single airspace, how will it be able to build a strong political union? Dominique Baudis  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the resolution on the Copenhagen Summit, since it is our responsibility, as elected members, to protect the planet for future generations. The world is staking its future on the months to come. It is unthinkable that the international community should fail to reach an agreement that binds States to the path of reason. Heads of State or Government, you hold in your hands responsibility for tomorrow’s Earth. Be capable of setting aside your national interests and short-term issues because humanity has no time to lose. Dominique Baudis  (PPE

Following the negotiations at the European Council of 29 and 30 October and the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court of 3 November, the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, has signed the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty will now be able to enter into force, providing the institutions with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and with a stable President of the Council for two and a half years. The structure of the new Commission, like the choice of figures who will occupy the posts of President of the Council and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, are crucial. The choice of President of the Council is crucial since it is he or she who will embody Europe for two and a half years. Moreover, at a time of globalisation and of power struggles between continents, the choice of High Representative for Foreign Affairs is of undeniable strategic importance. On 19 November, an extraordinary European Council will meet to negotiate the nominations. We are at a turning point in European history. The choices that you make, Heads of State or Government, will determine the Europe that you want in the future. Therefore, be ambitious, because Europe must be dynamic, proactive, effective and political if we want it to continue to progress. Dominique Baudis  (PPE
),

The world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job-creating growth. That was the agenda of the G20 in Pittsburgh. On the other hand – and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference – it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption. In other words, we must restart the machine and ensure that that machine pollutes less. Moreover, these two issues cannot be resolved one after the other; they are both urgent. Relaunching economic activity is urgent, and limiting the consequences of economic activity is urgent. At the G20 yesterday, and at the climate-change conference tomorrow, the European Union must tread a narrow path between two equally formidable threats. The European institutions must be established as quickly as possible under the Treaty of Lisbon adopted by the 27 countries of the Union. By ‘playing for time’ to delay this moment, the Czech President, Mr Klaus, has a big responsibility towards the 500 million citizens of the Union. Jean-Marie Cavada,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this somewhat late hour the students are, I trust, sleeping, and it will not be long before their teachers are doing the same. We, however, are still up. Drawing as it does on the Commission’s last report on the European Schools’ system, our report aims to improve the European Schools concept, which must be adapted to the new economic requirements and the changes in society. This concept must remain a model of inspiration for national school systems, promoting European citizenship and encouraging increased mobility, as well as the learning of the languages of the Member States, the languages of the countries of Europe. These are the main points of this report: first, it contains a set of policy priorities to improve this educational model in Europe, in particular by establishing an appropriate legal basis for it, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The current legal status has reached its limits and requires a radical change to allow the Union to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the work of the Member States, without, of course, superseding their competence, and to adopt legally binding acts to that end pursuant to Articles 2 and 6 of the TFEU. I believe that Article 165 of the Treaty could be a perfectly appropriate legal basis. The European Schools must set an educational example by basing themselves on the dissemination of European culture, values, integration and languages. It is, therefore, essential for the Member States to cooperate when developing their national syllabuses, drawing on the simple example, which has worked wonderfully well up to now, of the teaching approach used by the European Schools. The opening of Type II and Type III Schools must be wholeheartedly encouraged. It is in this spirit that the report insists that holders of the European baccalaureate should be able, once and for all, to apply to any university in the EU, with the same rights as nationals of the country in question who hold equivalent qualifications, as it is essential that the baccalaureate is automatically recognised in all of the Union’s Member States. In this difficult period, I wished to stress the absolute need to rationalise the Schools’ management costs, without calling into question the fundamental principles on which the concept rests, especially mother-tongue teaching by native speakers, in order to maintain the quality of this teaching. Similarly, I believe it is essential to maintain equal and equivalent teaching conditions for the children of all language communities in the European Schools. It is, therefore, with a concern for fairness that the report highlights, in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, the plan to see general use of the working languages for teaching all non-fundamental subjects, without, of course, this being detrimental to those whose mother tongue is not one of the working languages. To ensure good governance of the European Schools, very serious attention must be paid to the lack of seconded staff. This must be compensated for by local recruitment of teachers, whose salaries should be paid by the Schools. The Board of Governors must, therefore, ensure that Member States that do not contribute financially by seconding teachers pay an equivalent financial contribution to the Schools’ budget. I wished to reaffirm moreover that, in these difficult times in particular, provision for students with special educational needs remains a priority, and I have asked the Board of Governors, in this regard, to ensure that coefficients are applied to this category of student when calculating class sizes in order to ensure their full integration. Finally, Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to repeat my call to the Board of Governors to work on providing alternatives that allow students who are unable to complete the course to find vocational courses. I would not wish to finish this presentation without thanking the Commission, my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs, and especially the parents’ associations, who have enabled us to reach a consensus on which to progress this issue. Forgive me for having stolen 45 seconds from you. Jean Marie Cavada  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this is such a serious matter that one must rise above the dreadful arguments that I have just heard in this House, because when we talk about the media we are talking about the health of a democracy. President-in-Office of the Council, I am one of those people who admire and feel affection for your country and for the Hungarian people. I fully understand that your government and some members of the public wanted information to be handled in a more balance way, and, objectively speaking, they were right. However, replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right. Consequently I am pleased this evening, but I am vigilant. I am pleased to see that your government has decided to return to several fundamental points and to change the December 2001 law on the media. This needed to be done and you did well to address this matter. I am also pleased that you are once more showing greater respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights which your people have always craved in the course of recent history. I would like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Kroes, and I support the composition of her group of monitoring experts. However, we will be vigilant, because we also feel that a number of points have not been dealt with, and we shall also pay attention to the details of the legislative amendments. In conclusion, I should like to tell you, President-in-Office of the Council, that you are the heirs to the fatherland of Liszt, of Kossuth, of the 1940 hero, Joël Brand, of Sándor Kopácsi and Colonel Maléter of 1956. You are the heirs of Sándor Márai. You are the heirs of Imre Kertész. So do not let us down! It was a Hungarian who invented the magical game that is Rubik’s cube. Do not teach us, in Europe, to play with the media in the style of a ‘Jobbik’s Cube’ because that is a dreadful game. Jean-Marie Cavada  (PPE

Presidents, we are very fearful of the future of banking. The economy has transferred its toxic debts to finance; finance has passed the buck to the Member States, and the Member States are now turning to the citizens, who will have to pay, if they are able to. Now, Mr Leterme, you know far better than I that Europe must now perform its historic duty; in other words, it must impose a Community approach on Europe’s national leaders in terms of common discipline, certainly, but also in terms of recovery and innovation. In this drama which is being played out before us, there is no longer any national way out of the global crisis. Many European leaders – your colleagues – are watching the popularity ratings. At the moment, Europe’s leaders must look at history before history itself submerges us in the chaos of populism. Belgium is a country that was always strong on European patriotism; whether it is in a good or a bad state is immaterial. It is the will, discipline and objectivity of its leaders that will save us.

 I voted for this resolution, since it strikes a good balance in condemning the serious acts of violence between Israel and Hamas. The cessation of rocket attacks is imperative and cannot be up for negotiation. Terror is not a policy and Hamas must understand that. Equally, however, while there can be no question that Israel is entitled to protect itself, Tzahal should be more measured in its retaliation. The blockade on the Gaza Strip has been going on for too long now. Tel-Aviv must loosen its grip on this narrow strip of land. Its actions are counter-productive from a security viewpoint and create an intolerable humanitarian situation for the Palestinians. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted in favour of this report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, as it makes a pertinent assessment of the Union’s record on the matter and of the challenges that we must prepare to tackle together. It is important not to allow Europe to enter a strategic decline. The European Union has the tools to pursue a truly ambitious policy in security and defence. As the report indicates, the European Union must preserve its military intervention capability, but also its capacity to intervene by civilian, economic, humanitarian and commercial means to deal with the new situations that are arising in the world, sometimes at the fringes of Europe. I believe that Parliament is making a clear appeal for Member States to make a stronger commitment to the Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the only way of maintaining the strategic weight of a Europe that has fallen prey to budgetary difficulties in a multipolar world.

 I voted in favour of these two texts on migration from the Schengen Information System (1+) to SIS II. Our first message is clear: this migration was decided on several years ago, it is very delayed and it is now time to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently in the all of the Member States. We therefore urge the Council to get this system up and running without any further delay. Moreover, the SIS is a vital component of the Schengen system and Europe’s internal structure for the fight against organised crime and for internal security. This second version will modernise this database and, above all, provide a central structure under the Community system. The migration and, more generally, the database are subject to one absolutely fundamental principle (which is reiterated in both texts): stringent rules on the protection of personal data.

 In the lively debate on shale gas in the European Union and its Member States, there is no absolute truth. There is clearly a halfway point between those who are pro shale gas and those who are anti it, and it is essential to take the heat out of the debate. It would be a major strategic error to renounce this energy source now without even continuing the research. Equally, however, allowing unbridled exploration when the technique is not yet fully developed would be environmental madness. Shale gas has undeniable potential and we need to look at it seriously. As things stand, however, shale gas exploration puts the environment at risk and it would be irresponsible to go down that path. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The International Convention on the Rights of the Child, the anniversary of which was the actual day of this vote, states that a child is not simply a fragile being in need of protection but a person with the right to be educated, cared for and protected regardless of the part of the world where he or she is born. On this International Children’s Rights Day, the European Parliament passed by a large majority a resolution on the protection of children in the digital world against the risks of violence, fraud, child pornography and sexual harassment which children may encounter on the internet. Our resolution strongly asks States to make additional efforts to combat illegal and harmful content on the internet, to minimise the risks of internet use for children, while insisting on the importance of educating children in the new digital media. At a time when internet surfing is becoming a habit for our children, we need to provide enhanced protection for them. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The crisis we have experienced since 2008 has shown up the cracks in the current architecture for economic and monetary union. Today we need to learn from the crisis and give the EU the frameworks it needs to ensure it remains economically and financially stable as well as prosperous. That is the very meaning of this report. By voting in favour I also wanted to support two demands relating to democracy and social issues, which I believe are essential to this next wave of integration. Firstly, I believe strengthening economic and monetary union can only happen alongside a guarantee of greater democracy, which requires the involvement of and supervision by the European Parliament and national parliaments. Secondly, in view of the serious social crisis facing several Member States, I particularly support the recommendation to introduce social and employment benchmarks alongside current fiscal and macroeconomic benchmarks.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 is to be the European Year of Citizens, the year of European citizenship, 20 years after the creation of European citizenship and, as has been said several times this evening, one year before the renewal of the European Parliament. It is therefore a very symbolic year, even a very serious year, particularly in the present context. In fact, the latest surveys show that, since autumn 2009, there has been a very worrying and very noticeable trend towards a serious and very substantial loss of confidence in Community actions and the Community acquis
, even, when it comes to rights and freedoms, within the European Union itself. Faced with this situation, the essential question has always been, and still is, the need to consolidate a European identity, to succeed in creating a common feeling of belonging, to make a real success of defining the shape of this European citizenship, a shape which will be applicable to all Europeans. There is no doubt that this objective which has been announced can be achieved in 2013, but only by means of more information, more dialogue, more meetings, more exchanges and more sharing. Although I am delighted with the excellent quality of the text, I wish that our institutions, when making their choices and decisions, would show enough determination to give themselves the means of achieving their objectives, and would thereby demonstrate a strong political willingness to practice what they preach. Moreover, though of course I am happy about the results obtained in the negotiations, in particular by Ms Papadopoulou, who showed great determination, especially regarding the broadening of the scope of this European Year of Citizens in the decision-making process, the European civil dialogue, etc., I have strong reservations about the ridiculous budget allocated to this European Year, the smallest ever given to a European Year. Since the task is so enormous, I am sorry that the Council and certain members of the Committee on Budgets have refused to grant resources for this Year, which is, without doubt, one of the most important and one which, in my opinion, should be regarded as the Union’s first priority, because without European citizens we have no Europe and we cannot integrate Europe.

 I voted firmly in favour of this report, which, once again, strongly condemns the inadmissible practices of ‘extraordinary rendition’, secret prisons and torture, and, above all, EU Member States’ complicity in these CIA ‘programmes’. We have been demanding, for years now, that Member States involved in such activities conduct thorough, impartial and independent inquiries into the failings and abuses which occurred, and demanding that the European Union bring its action in line with its values. In this new report, we restate these demands. More detailed enquiries must be carried out and responsibility must be determined. The adoption of this report is a new step towards remedying these inadmissible practices. However, much work still remains to be done in order to establish the truth and acknowledge all of the violations which were committed. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

By adopting this own-initiative report, we wanted to send a clear message – separately from the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the asylum package – that the Dublin II system, whose faults and limitations have become clear, needs to be reformed. Our message is twofold: it emphasises both responsibility and solidarity. This is because it is fundamentally necessary to increase solidarity among European states in the area of asylum, as has become clear following the recent migratory flows following the events in Tunisia, then in Libya and now in Syria. More than ever, Europe needs a genuine common European asylum system, and there is an urgent need to implement European directives on asylum in order to make our European asylum system credible and efficient.

 The European Union had to react to the Mediator scandal, which claimed hundreds of victims, due to a lack of effective alert and response mechanisms in the face of a harmful drug. I voted for this amendment to the European legislation on pharmacovigilance because I think it is moving in the right direction: that of transparency and control. I think that the three main measures it introduces are very important: the real reasons behind a company’s decision to withdraw a medicine in a country will be known, these medicines will be systematically subjected to an urgent assessment, which will reveal the levels of hazard, and finally, a symbol on the medicine’s packaging will inform patients and practitioners if the medicine has been subject to an additional safety study. Within the framework of the organisation of the market for medicine, in which the EU has some powers, these measures will help to ensure, at EU level, that a health crisis such as the one we saw with Mediator will never happen again.

 I felt it was important to vote in favour of this resolution, which reaffirms certain principles regarding the donation of tissues and cells. It is an ethical requirement. However, several Member States do not take it into consideration: donations of tissue and cells should be voluntary, unpaid and, without any exception, anonymous. These ethical failures in certain Member States are set in an environment of regular revelations of cases of trafficking in human products. The main reason for my vote is to send a message to the Member States that they must put a stop to this trafficking. The scope of this resolution goes beyond ethical questions and addresses the issues of public health and the fight against criminal activities. Moreover, this resolution encourages the creation of systems allowing for greater European and international cooperation, aimed at improving the management of the growing need for human tissues and cells for innovative treatments, a need that, in itself, constitutes a major challenge for public health.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate our two co-rapporteurs on their work. After intense negotiations, which were difficult but exceedingly well organised, they managed to come to an agreement with the EU Council that will allow minimum standards on the protection of victims to be introduced throughout the European Union, marking another stage in the creation of the area of freedom and justice at Community level. Given the current situation, it is rare in the Union to find so many reasons to be satisfied. This evening, we can all welcome the mechanism outlined in this text to protect victims, who form a legal category that, as you said, Commissioner, is often forgotten in our national legal systems. Justice for victims means protecting them, facilitating their access to justice, supporting them and giving them the right to legitimate compensation. It was therefore essential to have this coordinated, integrated approach that benefits victims. I welcome three points in particular. The first is the fact that the Council largely agreed to better protection for children. This text pays particular attention to children and their needs, and to their vulnerability as far as protection is concerned. That is covered by this text, and Article 22 in particular, which enshrines in full the principles and standards advocated by the Council of Europe, and the rights specific to children and their protection. Secondly, as you pointed out, Commissioner, we need to train practitioners and all those likely to come into contact with victims, including civil servants, lawyers, and those responsible for victim support: Article 24 emphasises the need for general and specialist training, which is a good concrete, realistic step forward at Community level. Finally, it is essential to develop the network of host structures to ensure that all victims can find someone nearby who will listen to and support them. This personalised aid is fundamental in the European Union because these victims are often alone and distraught because of these traumatic situations. Now, Commissioner, all that remains is to take the necessary measures to inform the public and raise awareness of this new mechanism. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted resolutely against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) because the Agreement contained too many uncertainties and posed too many serious risks to the fundamental rights of Europeans. The benefit of ACTA, however, was that it tackled some real challenges: protecting intellectual property rights against counterfeiting and piracy, and setting out some real issues for enterprises, creation and intellectual property rights in Europe and in the world, which are essential. However, the negotiations on the agreement did not reconcile these requirements with the protection of citizens’ individual freedoms and fundamental rights. The outcome of the vote could not have been any different. It is an historic vote because it is the first time that the European Parliament has rejected an international trade agreement since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 After many months of negotiations, we have at last adopted the recast of the European railway legislation. Although it does not regulate everything, it nevertheless allows rail transport to be strengthened in the EU, particularly by clarifying the roles of the various actors in the rail transport sector. The flagship measures include strengthening the independence of the national regulators and establishing a European network of regulators in order for there to be a uniform interpretation and application of the legislation. Another vital aspect of this recast is the clarification of financial flows between the infrastructure manager and railway undertaking. This vote does not signal the end of the reform of the European railway market. Indeed, next year, the Commission should present new legislative proposals, particularly on the thorny issue of the liberalisation of national passenger transport and on the separation between the infrastructure management and transport operations.

 Better working conditions and greater compliance with legislation on driving and rest times for drivers in Europe: these are the reasons why I have decided to vote in favour of this text. It is also about creating greater transparency in an industry that is still very opaque. It is too easy to manipulate the tachographs currently in use and they do not provide the necessary guarantees to ensure that drivers’ driving and rest times are recorded efficiently in Europe. That is why it was crucial to adopt a text which lays the foundations for the use of new digital tachographs that will enable more effective checks which are also less restrictive for drivers.

 In accordance with European legislation, the Commission has a duty to translate European law and the related documents into all EU official languages to allow citizens, economic operators, NGOs and other interested parties to exercise their rights. However, in reality, many documents are only available in English. These include public consultations, even though they address citizens directly and are a fundamental component of drawing up transparent EU policies. Our resolution therefore urges the Commission to ensure that every EU citizen’s right to address the EU institutions in any of the EU official languages is fully respected and implemented. Respect for multilingualism is a principle, a right which is very important to me and we must defend it. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As Vice-Chair of the Tibet Intergroup, it is with much conviction that I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet. Our Parliament works tirelessly to protect the Tibetan people from the attacks and violence that they have been suffering for many years. In this sitting, we have adopted a new text which calls for the appointment of a special coordinator for respect for human rights in Tibet, which calls for constructive dialogue between China and the Central Tibetan Administration and which also calls on China to grant Tibetans their autonomy and to respect the fundamental rights (freedom of expression, freedom of belief, freedom of association, and so on) of the Tibetan people. Finally, the resolution strongly condemns the Chinese attitude towards Tibetans: the repression, prison sentences, and so on. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The PIP breast implants scandal has brought to light all of the shortcomings in the legislation on breast implants. For years, companies have been able to sell implants with defective gel to thousands of women worldwide without concern. In terms of public health, there should be no half measures. That is the message that I wanted to send by voting for this resolution, which proposes a strict framework so that such mistakes are not made again. We are clearly asking for more safety controls, but also, and above all, for greater traceability and a more restrictive marketing authorisation system. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I am pleased that the issue of the negotiations on the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) has finally been put on the work agenda of our European Parliament, particularly thanks to pressure from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to which I belong. By this, we hope that our Parliament is able to voice its opinion on this matter and that the European institutions adopt a strong common position to find a solution to the problems of arms transfers. Indeed, for the international community to sign a treaty of this nature sends a strong signal, insofar as it will establish common binding standards for the import, export and transfer of arms. This trade must urgently be regulated in view of the arms transfers that fuel conflicts, poverty and violations of the rights of individuals. We are calling for clear, binding provisions, which meet the highest international standards in accordance with international humanitarian law. This problem must urgently be tackled head on if we are to ensure lasting security and stability in the world. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Europe and its institutions are often depicted as being far removed from the citizens and their concerns and needs. Nonetheless, the European Union regularly steps in to assist ‘distressed areas’ or areas ‘experiencing difficulties’, especially through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This week, for example, Parliament has approved support amounting to EUR 1.6 million from the EGF for footwear workers in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain. The industry is currently being hit by highly aggressive competition from Asian countries and is faced with making numerous redundancies. I voted firmly in favour of adopting this report. Such assistance is both natural and essential: Europe is based on solidarity, so when one of its Member States is in difficulty, it is perfectly normal to come to its aid. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I voted for this report, which aims to strengthen and facilitate cross-border volunteering and to reduce the administrative, legal and linguistic barriers to volunteering. In this report, we call on Member States to set national targets for volunteering and to recognise the rights of volunteers, in particular, by establishing a European statute for volunteering. Our report also suggests introducing an online information portal on issues related to volunteering. 100 million European citizens are currently working in voluntary activities. Volunteering offers an incredible opportunity for exchange and learning, and cross-border volunteering offers great potential for education, employment and citizenship, to improve mutual understanding and help develop a stronger European identity. Volunteering is one way of living as an active European citizen and, being from the only French region that borders three other Member States, that is something close to my heart.

 The issue of equal pay for men and women has been on the political agenda for very many years now, but progress has been extremely slow. That is why I voted in favour of this text, which recommends, amongst other things, laying down stricter penalties for employers who practise pay discrimination of this nature. While I am not in favour of imposing penalties right, left and centre, it is true to say that certain employers today do not comply with rules which were laid down in the past. In 2012, it is no longer acceptable for women to earn around 17% less than men. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Once again, the European Parliament has voted in favour of this financial transaction tax with a large majority. I welcome this vote, which sends a strong signal to the markets and to those Member States still reluctant to impose such a tax. The high-risk behaviour of the financial markets contributed extensively to the crisis we are going through. It is absolutely crucial that they participate in the collective effort being made to get Europe out of this crisis and back on the road to growth. The European Parliament has expressed its view to that effect. It is now up to the Member States to do the same. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 As the EU pursues its goal to build a European area of freedom, security and justice, it needs a strong internal security strategy. The own-initiative report that we have adopted by a very wide majority therefore stipulates, first and foremost, that this strategy and all measures that are taken must thoroughly satisfy the obligations placed on them in terms of fundamental rights and upholding the rule of law. Our report then goes on to stress that the strategy must be backed by sufficient financial resources in the next budget period, to allow the European Union to actually address these challenges, and to do so in a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent way. Lastly, our strategy sets out five key areas for action in which the EU provides added value, and for which we need greater European cooperation. I am delighted that this report has been adopted.

 I voted in favour of this report, which sets out a framework for the future development of an EU criminal policy. In the building of a European area of liberties and justice, the criminal sphere has always been treated somewhat separately since it is a rather sensitive area directly affecting regulatory powers. Yet, at the current time, it is difficult to imagine that criminal law should fall outside the scope of constructing a Europe based on laws. The communitisation of criminal law is a considerable challenge, but also a necessity in terms of large-scale crime and cross-border crime, and this is the issue addressed by this report. Moreover, I welcome the perspectives provided by such communitisation in Europe: firstly, ‘eurocrimes’, as well as the creation of a genuine European Public Prosecutor’s Office, whose remit must go well beyond the mere protection of the financial interests of the European Union.

 At a time when the crisis and the disparities between regions are being accentuated within the European Union, territorial cohesion must be at the heart of EU policies now more than ever. It is this basic principle that I wanted to reaffirm by voting for this report. Indeed, regional airports have a key role to play in the economic development of the most remote regions by attracting companies, in particular, and also by enabling the development of tourism. Furthermore, as we are currently discussing the review of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), it would be appropriate, in this debate, to grant regional airports an important place alongside other major European transport nodes. In my view, this seems essential in order to achieve an optimal network across the EU. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution accompanying discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament’s 2010 budget. While I support the general guidelines contained in this resolution, I strongly oppose two clearly anti-Strasbourg amendments (Amendments 6 and 15), which were tabled and incorporated into this resolution. The debate and the attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament resurface with increasing regularity, and I am very mindful of this. Although it was long a symbolic issue, today it has become a predominantly legal and political one. I remain firmly committed to this permanent fight to keep the seat of the European Parliament within our beautiful European capital. Moreover, I voted against Amendment 4, which wanted to abolish the LUX Prize. Awarded each year by the European Parliament, the LUX Prize rewards films that go to the heart of European public debate and illustrate the universality of European values, cultural diversity and the process of European integration.

 While three out of four Europeans use their mobile phone while travelling, many find horrendously high bills waiting for them when they get home. Competition in the mobile roaming sector within the EU is still weak, leading to very high prices for consumers. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached at first reading on a text which I am sure provides effective solutions for improving the situation in the mobile roaming market for European consumers. Firstly, separating the provision of mobile phone services on national territory from roaming services will improve competition, as consumers will be able to choose whether they wish to keep the same communications provider while travelling and benefit from more attractive pricing. Secondly, gradually capping the maximum allowed charges made when billing for voice, SMS and data services between now and 2014 will be hugely beneficial to consumers. Furthermore, consumers will benefit from numerous measures improving transparency, such as the provision of information on roaming tariffs outside the EU, information on accumulated consumption expressed in the unit or currency of billing, and the introduction of safeguard caps (EUR 50 by default).

Once again, pirates from the Horn of Africa are attacking cargo boats off their coasts. Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is not, therefore, in decline. There are increasing numbers of incidents and they are becoming more violent. At the same time, more than 190 sailors are still held hostage and poverty remains ever present in this region of the world. I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, which calls for a strengthening of military resources, and also for solutions to be found to address the root causes of piracy. It is obviously essential to step up military presence, but that must be accompanied by an increase in humanitarian aid. Let us not forget that piracy and violence in the Horn of Africa are nourished, first and foremost, by the extreme poverty that prevails in the region. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Mr President, after being there in July 2011, I was, of course, deeply affected, as we all were, by the stories, the journeys, the courage, the path taken by these men, these women, these children who were suffering, arriving every day in Italy on the island of Lampedusa, before being crammed into detention centres in terrible conditions, sometimes defying all humanity, violating all human dignity, a long way from the much coveted European dream. There are both questions being asked and long-term political effects. Some such questions are: following our visits, we have all denounced the lack of information and today, one year later, we are still lacking information. How are the recent arrivals being managed? How many people have arrived? In what conditions are they living today? How many have been transferred to other centres or to the continent and where are the programmes on the island itself? We would like to know how the Italian authorities have used the more than EUR 232 million given to them to enable them to respond to this difficult situation. However, there are also long-term political effects. Apart from the fact that the paradise shores of the Italian island will forever remain extremely famous – the island of hopes and dreams for the arrival of these many Mediterranean boat people – I regret that this crisis in Lampedusa has brought us where we are today. This migratory crisis has been caused by poor management with regard to the arrival of these immigrants, which has furthermore led us to a famous France-Italy episode, to Italy granting temporary residence permits for migrants, then to the closure of borders by France and by Mr Sarkozy, culminating in a dramatic result for Europe and European integration, to a debate, which is today highly politicised, on the Schengen area, and to a situation where Europeans no longer like Europe because of Schengen and where this is being reflected in the elections. A real policy is therefore needed … (The President cut off the speaker) Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, SWIFT, ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) and PNR (Passenger Name Records) are acronyms that we often hear and which are a source of concern to Europeans who do not really know what lies behind them. What is the reality hidden behind these names? Excessively generalised surveillance of passengers, and an agreement which means that if I take an aeroplane, the United States will know about my dietary tastes, my behaviour at the airport, aspects of my health, and so on. Without going over all the arguments that have been advanced this morning in a long but fascinating debate, I would like to remind you that, since 2007, we have been calling for guarantees, such as red lines, which would have allowed us to obtain an agreement from Parliament. Yet we do not have this at the moment, either in terms of reciprocity or in terms of proportionality, as our admirable colleague, Mr Watson, reminded us in relation to the position taken by the United States, and I would question the proposals of Mrs Foster, which claim that passenger name records do not involve all that much. If they do not involve all that much, then let us call for reciprocity from the United States. In this Chamber, some people are saying that this is the best that we could achieve, that we will not get any more, that we must ask the judges. It is unacceptable to abdicate our responsibilities in this way. It is up to us to create the conditions of balance, of European democracy, between the security of combating terrorism and the preservation of liberties. That is why I will vote against this agreement. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

Madam President, although slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, there are still many children, and some women and men, who fall victim to human trafficking in Europe every day. We are talking about domestic slaves, prostitutes, beggars and clandestine workers who live through a genuine ordeal of physical violence, humiliation and, at every stage of this hell, anger. Moreover, in nearly 40% of cases this phenomenon involves children. Totally powerless, these people are taken away, held against their will, beaten, subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, and deprived of their rights. The Union and its Member States have a historic responsibility, as you have reminded us, Commissioner, and we must act together to face up to this criminal activity which flouts the whole spectrum of human rights, particularly those of women. Above all, though, it is of course up to the Union to protect children, the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society. In relation to this cooperation, Commissioner, although the directive does of course represent an advance and a step forward, it is your task to exert strict supervision of the Member States’ responsibilities through specific and tangible measures, so that we can eliminate this veritable cancer which contravenes the foundations of our democratic societies and the values that have been cemented by European integration. What will you do in relation to the Member States’ obligation to transpose the directive? The second question is: what news is there of the information and awareness campaign? Finally, what about the collection of information relating to trafficking in human beings, and what actions could be taken precisely on the basis of this data collection? Nathalie Griesbeck,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have spoken about challenge. While it is true that Greece is facing an enormous challenge, we need, above all, to respond to a challenge facing the European Union: its image in the world, and how the citizens see it. One would have thought that the end of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin wall, would lead us to believe that we would never again see the construction of other walls anywhere in Europe. Yet this is not at all the case. There is an enormous project, devised by Greece, to try to resolve to its huge problems caused by the arrival – as our Greek colleague said – of more than 300 people a day at its borders through a transit country, Turkey, and these are citizens who do not come from Turkey but from many other countries around the world. One would have thought that such a thing would never be seen again. What is more, this phenomenon is accompanied by an utterly disgraceful humanitarian situation, which violates the human rights we are constantly developing, protecting, defending and safeguarding as the most precious gift that the European Union has given to its citizens. The solutions to the problems are, needless to say, difficult, and the messages are complex. Without getting into the technical side of things, it is of course quite clear that solidarity – as Cecilia Malmström has just explained, through the idea of shared responsibility, through technical mechanisms, the funding that must be used, the earmarking of EU funds – should make it possible to provide effective aid and to address the situation in which these people find themselves with dignity and in a manner that is consistent with human rights. The second message, which has often been heard in recent weeks in Europe, is to up the stakes in the construction of texts and a rule of law system conveying the solidarity of the Member States towards Greece, which is coming under pressure along its borders. To ‘up the stakes’ means to construct a veritable arsenal of texts applicable by all and not to miss the point either, like when in my country, France, we talk about re-erecting internal borders when what we should be doing is protecting external borders – in a spirit of humanism, it should be remembered. Finally, Madam President, the third reply, or the third message underlying our proposals, is to have the possibility and the political will to achieve a balance between the north and the south and to use development aid and partnerships with southern countries so that migrants have no desire to come to an El Dorado that does not exist.

Madam President, I of course fully appreciate that Greece cannot deal with the situation alone. That is what I was trying to explain. I had the opportunity to visit the island of Samos in Greece where I saw the very difficult situation at first hand, and I also visited the island of Lampedusa, where I saw just how complicated the problems were. It is by acting together in solidarity, supporting Greece, a Member of the European Union, as much as possible, that we will be able to respond. However, for these responses to be substantive, they must be taken into account across all EU policies. I of course recognise the difficulty facing Greece. It is as if I were Greek.

 I voted for this report, which makes two noteworthy improvements to the coordination of social security systems within the European Union. The first is the clarification concerning access to unemployment benefits, enabling self-employed frontier workers to receive unemployment benefits in the country in which they have been working if they are resident in another Member State where there is no unemployment benefit system. The second is the introduction of the ‘home base’ concept for aircrew members (pilots, air hostesses, etc.), which will put an end to the social dumping that low-cost airlines practise against their personnel and thus guarantee fair social security for all aircrew personnel. As a native of a very ‘cross-border’ region, I fully support any initiative that strengthens the mobility of European citizens within the European Union, so that they can travel, move and work throughout the EU without administrative barriers.

Given their situation, their characteristics, their geographical distance, the structural weaknesses of their economies and their dependence on the outside world, etc., the outermost regions (ORs) of the European Union should be granted special treatment under the European Union’s cohesion policy, so that their unique features are adequately considered and protected. At a time when we are negotiating the new EU budget programming with the EU institutions, our Parliament has strongly objected to the Commission’s proposal to reduce the specific allocation for ORs by nearly half, pointing out that these regions should receive special treatment. In this resolution, which I supported, we also insist that the specific characteristics of the ORs are taken into account in all European Union policies: fisheries and maritime policy, transport, the environment, etc. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 Cancelled flights, lost baggage, delays, overbooking, etc. are all dysfunctions that are currently poorly addressed by the regulations in force. What was needed, therefore, was a new framework and new instruments to guarantee air passengers’ rights in all circumstances. That has now been achieved through this resolution, which, above all, provides greater transparency both in the information given when flights are delayed or cancelled and also in the prices that airlines advertise. Together with this need for transparency, there was also a need to improve the assistance given to passengers. Accordingly, this resolution states that passengers in difficulty should be able to talk directly to contact personnel who can provide immediate solutions and answers. In addition, the report considers that, if luggage is delayed by more than six hours, compensation should be offered that is proportionate to passengers’ needs so that they have the items they need while waiting for their luggage to arrive. Lastly, the resolution stresses that persons with reduced mobility should be given easier access to aircraft. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

In the negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in securing a number of key points: the explicit reference to regional protection programmes, especially the visibility of North Africa, the addition of ‘survivors of violence and/or torture’ to the vulnerable persons category and a reference to refugees from Iraq. I therefore voted in favour of this agreement at second reading. In addition, the negotiations on this text, aimed at amending the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund in the light of the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme, have been going on for nearly two years. We cannot allow this situation to continue when there are thousands of refugees who could benefit from this programme. Indeed, resettlement is the only viable and safe solution as these people are often in an extremely vulnerable situation. The European Union must step up its resettlement efforts in order to protect refugees and maximise the impact of resettlement by focusing, where possible, on those most in need, in accordance with the common priorities established at EU level.

 I voted against the Vaughan report on the draft budget for the European Parliament for the financial year 2013. I do fully support the measures and guidelines contained in this report, such as freezing our Parliament’s budget in real terms, freezing Members’ allowances, the cuts made in the budget relating to travel, the various savings that have been made, etc. However, this report contains three provisions/paragraphs that are clearly anti-Strasbourg. That is why I voted against it. The debate and attacks on the location of the seat of the European Parliament are coming up more and more often and I am very aware of that. Of course, for a long time, it was a question of symbolism; but today, and above all, it is a legal and political matter. I remain firmly committed to this ongoing fight to keep the European Parliament’s seat in our beautiful European capital. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The report that we have adopted by a very large majority this week aims to list the obstacles to European citizenship that still exist and persist (with regard to free movement, recognition of qualifications and non-discrimination, for example) and to firmly ask Member States to remove these difficulties. Beyond that, citizenship should be the European Union’s number one priority as, without European citizens, there would be no Europe and we could not construct Europe, especially in the context of the economic crisis, the crisis of values that we are facing today. There is currently only a slight sense of European citizenship. Yet, this lack of ‘European sentiment’, this lack of involvement from citizens in the European Union and the EU’s lack of transparency for European citizens are Europe’s greatest flaws. What European citizens are missing is the feeling of belonging to a European community and this is vital for the European Union. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 This week, our Parliament approved the setting up of a special parliamentary committee on organised crime, corruption and money laundering and I welcome it. I am convinced that this committee will provide an effective tool in analysing and evaluating these complex transnational phenomena, in preventing them and, most particularly, in combating them. This committee will be able to establish contacts, make visits, hold hearings, act with civil society and grassroots actors who are fighting on a daily basis against these scourges and, consequently, will be able to recommend measures to enable the European Union to combat these threats.

 Language difficulties, lack of understanding of neighbouring judicial systems, infrequent contacts and exchanges between institutions: these are all obstacles to the construction of a European judicial area. The challenges of judicial training at the level of the European Union are therefore considerable as there can be no construction of a European judicial area if we do not provide appropriate training for those who are the actors within it. Therefore, we must really take this issue in hand and make considerable efforts in relation to judicial training, not only of judges, but also of all other legal practitioners: lawyers, notaries, ombudsmen … in other words, all legal practitioners. There is a clear need today to build a European judicial culture and to do everything in our power to achieve this. We must promote contacts, exchanges and, in particular, I would like to point out the importance of setting up a genuine ‘Erasmus for judges’. Nathalie Griesbeck  (ALDE

 The European Union is the world’s principal consumer of chocolate, 70% of global cocoa production is cultivated in West Africa and approximately 18 million children throughout the world are estimated to work on cocoa plantations. The European Union cannot turn a blind eye to this utterly unacceptable situation which is dreadful in human terms. These children work in extremely dangerous conditions, they are frequently exposed to pesticides, and many are victims of human trafficking. I therefore strongly voted in favour of the annex to this resolution, which follows Parliament’s consent to the renewal of the International Cocoa Agreement in terms of production and commerce. This resolution is aimed at focusing on the issue of child labour in cocoa plantations and, in particular, it strongly condemns the use of child labour (and unacceptable types of work) in the growing and harvesting of cocoa beans.

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution on addressing the European Union’s diabetes epidemic, which calls on the Commission to develop and implement a targeted European strategy on diabetes prevention, diagnosis, education and research, and calls on the Member States to implement national diabetes programmes, focusing on prevention. Diabetes affects almost 10% of Europe’s population and this figure is expected to increase by 16.6% by 2030. It is therefore necessary for the EU to adopt a European strategy to complement the national efforts in order to provide ongoing financial support for research and encourage early diagnosis of the disease.
