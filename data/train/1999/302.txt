 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely pleasing that in the penultimate week of the session of this parliamentary term we will be adopting such a fine, interesting and new European project, a project that I thought could be passed without either conflicts or objections on the part of the Council. This confidence must now be moderated somewhat, since I have heard, Madam Commissioner, that you do not agree with several of the amendments, including those proposed by me. Perhaps the administration could once again go through various points with me this evening, so that tomorrow we will in fact be able to adopt something going further than what we had initially had submitted to us. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whom I have produced this opinion, has not only taken the project seriously and welcomed it, but we have also integrated it in our work. We know that mobility and lifelong learning are today important components for professional success and that often up to now neither the economy nor policies have put in place the conditions for it. This is now going to change. For these reasons, we have made various proposals and additions, which we regard as important, for example the inclusion of third-state nationals – we regard this as a symbol of fairness – the inclusion of the social partners in order to make use of their know-how, the consideration to be given to social integration and, last but not least, more and better information for the public, providers of education and training and social partners, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. This is because the entire project will only be any use, will only be successful, if it is known about, if it is accepted by young people, by workers and also by industry and society. So it will be necessary also to conduct a campaign of explanation and information. Then, I think, we will be able to get this child onto the right track.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, having observed a minute’s silence, it is sad to have to speak about a piece of legislation that is actually calculated to bring the people of Europe together, to endow them with rights that carry weight throughout Europe, and to open up to them the chance of seeing Europe as providing employment prospects and as providing a labour market. This legislation has been in place for over 30 years, and, as has already been said by others, we reform it every year in order to incorporate the latest changes to national laws, and also to take account of the most recent rulings by the European Court of Justice. I think the Commission proposal makes sense, as do Commissioner Solbes’ suggestions relating to the amendments. I see it as regrettable that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats seeks to use this report as a means of engineering changes that belong in the main reform and not here. In fact, it might seem somewhat confusing that we should today be discussing the revision of Regulation No 1408, for, over recent months, during the last few weeks, and in the last meeting of the Committee, we have been having very in-depth discussions about the major and imminent reform, which has been in progress alongside this, in which, too, we have made definite improvements for the benefit of the European public, and which is, to all intents and purposes, about to be completed. All this, though, has to be said with the small reservation that the great reform will enter into force only in 2007, and that is why adjustments are needed right now. Let me extend my group’s thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gillig, who has produced a creditable and responsible report; she could, of course, have yielded to the temptation to introduce lots of nice amendments, but either the Commission or the Council would have ended up preventing us from putting them into effect. That is what makes this report so responsible. One problem, of course, still remains, one that my two lady colleagues from the Netherlands and Belgium will address, namely the situation of those who commute across borders; this will no doubt give rise to more major difficulties in all the Member States and will probably still be doing so after enlargement. We have, however, managed to find a balance between, on the one hand, enabling citizens to enjoy the social security benefits of a particular state, and, on the other, preventing national social security systems from being overloaded. It is a balanced report and a realistic one, and what I would say to the Members from the Group of the European People’s Party is that we should not weigh it down with amendments that are actually ill-advised at the present time.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I have to say that I do not fully understand why Mr Bushill-Matthews asked this question. We are all aware of the problem, and the Commissioner’s reply has also demonstrated that something is being done, and that naturally pressure is also being put on Member States as and where we can. I think your points, particularly the three requests, are expressed in too summarised a form to seriously tackle the topic as a whole and all aspects of demographic change. Both the Member States and the candidate countries are aware of the challenges. Let me refer you to the two reports our committee and Parliament have already approved in 2001 and 2003, which were produced by Mr Cercas and Mr Andersson. I think you will find the subject receives much more thorough treatment in those reports. We are not only talking about raising the age of retirement, as Mr Bushill-Matthews has reminded us. Clearly one issue is the need to remove the incentives for taking early retirement. Of course, we also need to get rid of the discrimination older workers still often encounter in our labour market, such as the fact that they are rarely allowed to participate in further training, the way their experience is often under-used, the way they have no chance of any kind of promotion. All this forms part of making the labour market attractive and reasonable for older workers. There is certainly a lot of catching up to be done, both by the Member States and on our side, which goes far beyond simply increasing the age of retirement. Of course, one other element, as Mrs Bastos has said, is to consider how we can promote child-friendly employment conditions in the European Union; how we can support women in combining work and family. I think there is a hefty contradiction if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Demcorats have no problem with calling for a 55- or 60-hour working week, as they did yesterday, expects that, and never stops to consider that it completely rules out a child-friendly society. I think this is another important point. The third and last point is that of course we need to have an unbiased, open and serious discussion about an active immigration policy. We should also seriously discuss the immigration strategy mentioned recently in this House by Kofi Annan. I think all this belongs to a policy which establishes a balance between the generations and welfare as well as showing intergenerational solidarity, as it is often called here. This is more important than simply talking about raising the retirement age.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a number of remarks by previous speakers relating to firms’ need for leeway and room to manoeuvre, and to their productivity. What we are talking about here is not rules on 35-hour or 38-hour weeks, but the option that exists in certain Member States of a week of 55 or more hours. I have to say that I regard this opting-out arrangement as absolutely absurd. Figures like that belong in the nineteenth century; I am convinced that the productivity of our businesses is not dependent on them and that they will not make us the most modern and the most efficient economic region in Europe. What matters most of all to businesses is the options available for machinery’s runtimes and operating times, rather than any unnecessary extension of working time. Businesses care about modern forms of labour organisation. In fact, Germany is a good example of how the social partners can be involved in the shared development of modern types of employment, organisation of work and working times. I might add that it is this that has enabled us to lead the world in the export field. Let it also be said that the figures, data and times currently under discussion do not seem to take account of the possibility of workers having such things as children and families. Who, after all, is capable of being away from home for 48, 55 or more hours in a week? I might remind you that the Working Times Directive was meant, as one of its objectives, to be an instrument for reconciling work and family life. Mr Pronk said something very good about the opt-out, namely that it has actually failed. Had it been a derogation with a limited lifespan, nothing could have been said against it. Now, though, in the meantime, there are several countries that want to adopt this British model, and it is unfortunate that these include Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and most of the accession countries that will be joining us on 1 May. I doubt that the Commissioner will often have come across so much public approval as there has been as a result of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in connection with hospital doctors. It is, for this reason, vital that we counteract every tendency to hand these things back to the national level. It is in this area that European social policy is under scrutiny, as are guaranteed European standards, for if we make it possible for these matters to be handed back to the national level, you can be sure that the same thing will happen in many other cases in the life of the next Parliament. In order to nip that sort of thing in the bud, we want the precise legal framework, which you have promised us. We are happy to go along with that, but let there be no turning back!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are somewhat surprised by the difficulty that the Commission sometimes has with complex social policy legislation like the Posting of Workers Directive, with evaluating them, reforming them where necessary, with reports to Parliament and also with new concepts. That happened, unfortunately, with the European Works Council, and it is, equally unfortunately, happening with the Posting of Workers Directive now. This is astonishing, for both of these acts to which I have referred send out messages to workers and the public, signalling that we do in fact have such a thing as a European social model. That is what makes it regrettable. When the Committee was debating this, the Commission even sought to persuade us that all the problems with the Directive had nothing to do with Europe, but largely resulted from defects in transposition at national level. We do not believe that to be the case. The way in which the Directive is implemented can hardly be described as satisfactory when there are hundreds of appeals pending before national and regional labour and social security tribunals. Even though these are national courts, it goes to show that there is something lacking in the Directive itself and that there is inadequate legal certainty. Rare though it is for us to criticise the Commission for this, it is for this reason that we believe that your report oversimplifies matters, and the same criticism can, alas, be levelled at the rapporteur. Nevertheless, Mrs Glase, there was outstanding cooperation, and I cannot be other than grateful to you for having accepted nine out of the ten amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I also want to agree with Mr Pérez Álvarez, who pointed out that abuses persist and that employers are still exploiting workers, and, extraordinarily enough, we see not only in Germany but also in other countries how very creative employers can be when it comes to getting round the law. What that means is that the only thing this House wants to argue about is the timescale, and I can be quite frank in telling you that we are not talking about giving the Commission one month more or less to draft a new and thorough report. We have learned from experience, though, that if we give you 14 months instead of 12, it will take you 22 or 26, and so, as we need to exert a certain amount of pressure, we have decided to ask for 12 months. This is regrettable, as we otherwise agree, but I will conclude by saying that I am convinced that this is a deadline you can meet if, in carrying out the analysis, you join with the social partners and the European trades unions, who already have the necessary data, with details of the deficits and abuses, ready to hand.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there have indeed been many initiatives, including in the Member States, aimed at stopping harassment and taking preventive action against it. I still recall – as I think we all can – the initiative launched in Germany 30 years ago, which aimed to humanise the working environment and our recent discussion of a communication from the Commission on modernising the organisation of work. We also remember how the Belgian Presidency took an initiative to improve the quality of work, but all that was not enough. I can understand you when you say, Commissioner, that the Member States assess and evaluate these things differently, but we cannot fail to see that all industrialised nations have the same problem. I agree with Mr Andersson when he says that this is not about the 8% of workers investigated by Eurofound in Dublin – amounting in any case to 12 million employees – but, unfortunately, about the way in which this phenomenon is on the increase and the figures are rising. The fact that people are working under greater pressure in many sectors, including the services sector, makes harassment a bigger and more difficult problem. I therefore agree with all my fellow-members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the need for a legal framework. Necessary though they are – I am in agreement with that – awareness campaigns are not enough! Commissioner, we know how bold you are when it comes to dealing with the inertia of certain Member States. We know that it will be more difficult to submit legislation on this than on such things as a ban on asbestos or protection against noise. We know, too, that many major companies have their own rules already – I know that Volkswagen does, and so do others. There are many of them, but most have nothing yet, and the majority of employers have not yet recognised how many euros they are losing as a result of time lost because workers are off sick, because of reduced motivation, because people become resigned to their lot, because they become less enthusiastic about work or lose their enthusiasm altogether – all of this caused by harassment. The fact is that if employers were to acknowledge this, we would not be having these problems. Since we do, though, we need to create a legal framework, and the protection of workers from occupational hazards is Europe’s responsibility. The task is ours, and we should get on with it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must, no doubt, all concede that we were somewhat surprised by how very successful this year was. I am myself always sceptical when ‘European Years’ devoted to social policy objectives are declared, and, at the end of them one cannot actually point to anything having been achieved. Such was not the case with this one. This may be because this ‘Year’ was something special, above all in that it promised much, and because the idea for it was put to politicians by non-governmental organisations and associations of handicapped persons. There were discussions of a wide variety of topics, in which disabled people themselves discussed national and European approaches. Rather than having discussions about disabled people, we discussed things with them. In my own country, too, a debate has got under way, which has as its objective, not only legislative measures but also, of course, the raising of public awareness. We want unrestricted participation, no longer to be cared for outside society in the way we once were. We want full equality rather than the former demeaning sympathy, and, instead of being patronised by well-meaning people, we want the right to autonomy. For that, of course, we need legislative measures. I might add that we in this House agreed that this Year should not remain a one-off, a concern that the Commission’s new action plan takes up. I think the Commission is still being a bit too hesitant as regards the timescale, as we should make use of the present commitment, which is evident everywhere, rather than putting things off for another two or three years. I am also glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has managed to get a line inserted into the Budget, not merely for a survey, but for following up all the things that have gone well in this European Year. I would like to close with a very fine slogan that you, Commissioner, mentioned at a recent event, when you said that we should use ‘Getting on Board’ as a slogan. I would like to end with a slogan for the future, when disabled people will not just be ‘Getting on Board’ but also ‘Staying on Board’. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with continuity and accountability, planning a budget requires that any necessary adjustments and reforms be made; more than anything else, it also calls for political vision. In a constructive dialogue, this House’s specialists in social policy have made a package of these objectives and adopted them by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Our priorities include industrial safety, by which I mean that our agencies should be adequately equipped and enabled, above all, to press on with the programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and also micro-businesses, something that is especially necessary in the candidate countries. We also seek a moderate increase in funding for the Community initiative EQUAL and for non-governmental organisations. The Community initiative EQUAL is a specific instrument, within the framework of the European Social Fund, for realising our ideas and achieving our objectives, which are also those of the Lisbon process. We have to make progress towards these goals, and to do so, we have to guarantee that the initiative is endowed with the necessary funding. We need more jobs – sustainable jobs – and we also want to promote training – training with qualifications – and strengthen its role in the Member States, while at the same time offering businesses incentives to discharge their obligations. Until such time as there is any change, we will keep on criticising the flow of funds from the European Social Fund, which, this time round, is still a scandal – not one attributable to Parliament or the Commission, but, we believe, one for which the Member States bear responsibility. This is something that we want to change in the forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds, rather than taking action in the course of this Budget. Our political vision is of course not just about making enlargement a reality, but primarily about the creation of a social Europe, which is where we still have a lot of catching-up to do in amidst the other tasks that Europe has to accomplish.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, making the European labour market possible is in fact the goal of all the Member States, and, since 1971, we have also had an instrument for this purpose, that being Regulation No 1408. How, though, do things stand in practice? A number of Member States have set up various obstacles and allowed them to remain in place. That is why I am glad that the long-overdue reform of Regulation 1408 is at last on the table. Had it not been for this nonsensical unanimity rule in the Council, it would have been there much sooner. That notwithstanding, we have proved that we are capable of coping, shortly before the end of the parliamentary term, not only with enlargement, but also with giving a social policy reform greater depth. The first thing to be said about it is that it makes everything simpler, which is what both the public and Parliament want, and it also incorporates rulings by the European Court of Justice on such things as the entitlement to medical services. Secondly, there are also qualitative reforms, and this House and the committee have encouraged and emboldened the Commission to formulate these as such. They include, for example, the right of unemployed people to remain in Europe for up to six months for the purpose of seeking work; this involves family members and people who are no longer involved in economic activity being included in the scope of the Regulation. It involves all these things, because we are of course inviting to Europe not only workers but also their families. Like Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I am especially glad that we have made a special arrangement for people with disabilities, something that the Council was initially unwilling to accept. I hope that we will now be able to reach a compromise. What is important is that nobody who wants to avail themselves of the mobility option and whom we wish to support in their desire to do so, should fall through the social security system’s net. It is also important that we should reiterate that this is about coordination and about the acknowledgement of entitlements, and not about the transfer of social benefits from one state to another. There were also, of course, a number of conflicts – not with Mrs Lambert, whom I thank for her cooperation, and nor even that much with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, apart from the point relating to families, which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has just mentioned. Some Member States take a very narrow view of what constitutes a family – I would say they have a twentieth-century view of it – whilst others have a more modern approach in line with the twenty-first. What we, in fact, regard as important is that this definition, when we decide on one, will have no legal significance in terms of the Regulation, and that we will not be enforcing some sort of acceptance of a lifestyle on any Member State. For that reason, we should perhaps show a bit more tolerance. My final point is that it matters a great deal both to me and to my group that we should now – great and important though this reform is – keep this Regulation open-ended. There will without doubt be more cases in which we will have to get involved, particularly when we are joined by ten new Member States next year, when we will gain experience and perhaps have to make more changes. It is for this reason that we also support the Commission’s idea of flexible action in areas that are left open and also of regulating those matters that have not been sorted out, such as taxation and the occasional possibility of double taxation – which will perhaps happen in the next legislative period.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly not often the case that we have such a consensus here in this House on such a complex issue. I would therefore also like to thank Mr Menrad for incorporating the ideas, proposals and wishes of the Socialist Group, as well as my own as shadow rapporteur. Employee participation in the ownership of productive wealth was actually a far more topical issue fifty years ago than it is today. For this reason too, I think it is a good thing that in Europe, we are reviving this concept and these opportunities, and now that the internal market has been created, are giving employees this opportunity. Nowadays, however, we are perhaps in a more difficult situation because we are in competition with other models for which state incentives must be provided, such as company and private pension schemes. However, one thing must be clear to us all: models of employee part-ownership of productive wealth can only be implemented in practice if state incentives are provided. These, of course, are more difficult to achieve at present. The aim of this proposal, these ideas, the drafts and, perhaps at a later stage, a directive, is not only to create new jobs – although that is important. Nor is the aim simply to raise productivity – although we naturally expect this as well. No, the aim is also to achieve a more just distribution of added value. We can only expect workers to show consideration for companies' profit levels or, indeed, exercise wage restraint if the distribution ratio between labour and capital is not shifted to their disadvantage. We also agree with Mr Menrad that the primary task is not harmonisation but better coordination, more information and – as part of a directive, of course – a voluntary approach. We expect employees to be protected from the risks associated with bankruptcies. We expect the more problematic groups to be included as well, such as the small and medium enterprises – SMEs. We expect low-wage workers and women who have a different working career, a different work situation, to be included too. I am convinced that the Commission will take up all our ideas and, on that basis, will work with us to produce a more far-reaching initiative, perhaps next year, which can then lead to a more just distribution of productive wealth.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his proposals, which are supported by our group as well. In our view, there is a need to put forward ambitious objectives and pragmatic specific measures, with new and innovative approaches and more local and regional initiatives – all of which you have included in your report. For a long time, we have been passing resolutions demanding that the national parliaments be more involved – not only Denmark’s and Scotland’s, but those right across the European Union. However, the fact that the European Employment Policy allows national objectives and decision-making leeway is another indicator of how astute it is. What I would like to tell the honourable lady Member from Sweden is that the German labour market might well be in need of reform, but there is not one Member State of the European Union in which the removal of protection against dismissal has helped to create jobs. I want to say, though, that there are two points on which we are critical of the Christian Democrats. One, which has already been referred to, is Amendment No 62. The Commission has proposed the use of immigration policy to govern the way in which the potential labour becoming available through immigration is used. I think there is a need for the Christian Democrats to face up to this fact and for this not to be taken, as it were, ad absurdum
 by means of special bilateral arrangements between the Member States, with conservatives remaining silent in the face of this practice. We cannot support tax cuts across the board, and I find it regrettable that this amendment is being treated as the most important. Europe’s entrepreneurs expect something different: their expectations are for the security that makes it possible to plan for the long term, for qualified workers, the best possible infrastructure, promotion of science and research, the weeding-out of rules and regulations, and investment. There is a need for such measures, and they cannot be brought about by tax cuts across the board.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the public – especially in the candidate countries – often makes the erroneous assumption that the European Union's Budget deals, in effect, only with agricultural policy. Such an assumption is not only fatal, but also false. It is even more important, in times of economic upheaval and renewal, for us to affirm and create social cohesion in order, among other things, to stabilise democracy and gain public acceptance in these new Member States. Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like, then, to highlight four points from the debate that were of particular importance to us. In this context, the first is support for the social dialogue. In practically all the candidate countries there is still the need to establish and reinforce structures that will make the social dialogue a reality. The second point is the need to improve conditions in the workplace. Our work in the Member States treats health and safety at work as a priority, and the same must be true in the candidate countries. The third point is that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stressed our desire to have greater support, in every case, for the social platform as part of the action programme against social exclusion and discrimination. I would refer you to the Lisbon resolution in which we highlighted competitiveness and employment opportunities and stressed the need for them. In the candidate countries, restructuring affects not only agriculture, but still also major, and outdated, sectors of industry. They need our help with that, help that we can – and should – provide by means of European Union funds. In all these areas, we rely, of course, on the knowledge of the agencies. We therefore expect them to receive the financial appropriations that they need.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mann observed during the discussions in committee that his report had not enjoyed the support to which he had previously been accustomed. This of course is partly due to a number of demands which have a very specific national character and which do not really belong in the European debate at all. I support the intention expressed in his report, which is that the guidelines should concentrate on what is essential and that annual reports should also continue to be produced in future. Also in terms of the objectives, I believe that we have achieved broad consensus, especially as regards flexibility on the labour markets, without subjecting the workforce – the employees – to any unnecessary dismantling of their social protection. The path towards this goal is undoubtedly a matter of debate. Fresh ideas would be all well and good, Mr Pronk, but in some areas, we can detect very clear retrograde steps, starting with the involvement of the national parliaments. Mr Mann has called for the national parliaments to be allowed to exercise greater control, yet we agreed some time ago that they will not only exercise control but will participate through the framework of legislation – which goes much further. Indeed, Sweden and Denmark have already applied this in principle. Moreover, Mr Mann calls for implementation of the national further training plans to be pushed through. Here too, we agreed that there should be legislation imposing a binding obligation and setting out workers' rights to further training. Furthermore – and this, of course, is where we cannot agree with him – he calls for indiscriminate tax cuts and wage subsidies. These are not fresh ideas. They are completely obsolete. Nor do they promote the entrepreneurial creativity that we urgently need.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was slightly surprised by the last two speeches because I assumed that we had reached a reasonable compromise between the first reading and now in the conciliation procedure and that we had improved the Commission proposal on a number of counts. I think the conciliation procedure was swift and determined to reach a result, the Council was constructive, and I rather had the impression that the PPE-DE and the Liberals had moved some way towards us. I thought that sense had triumphed! Nonetheless, and here I agree with the previous speakers, one aspect must give us cause for concern and that is implementation in the Member States, but not – as Mr Bushill-Matthews said – for technical reasons. I think there is another reason why implementation should give us cause for concern. I heard today about a professional musician working with a famous German orchestra who turned down an interview with us out of fear of reprisals. He was to have described his problems as a professional musician but was too frightened to do so, and I am sure he is not the only case. Employee protection, as Mrs Stauner said, is a basic necessity in modern working life, not a superfluous luxury. The directive has added some important aspects in order to give employees in all sectors, from music to industry, the security of knowing they have a right to instruction and information on the risks to which they are exposed and that employers must point these risks out to them. There are several options open to the Member States here, not just passive hearing protection. They can also introduce new working methods and develop new jobs in which noise levels are kept to a minimum.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most Member States already have laws on temporary work or collective agreements, but they vary substantially in quality. The German legislation formerly in force was certainly not as simple as has been claimed here, and the public, whether they were employers or employed, did not accept it. Let me list just some of the peculiarities in the German restrictions: the ban on 'synchronisation', limitation to twelve months, a ban on fixed-term employment, and a ban in the construction industry. This is why I think that the German Government and parliament have taken a very courageous and significant step by already incorporating the European directive currently being debated into the qualitative improvements for Germany. It was unacceptable for workers in Germany to be earning up to 40% less than the permanent staff. No wonder the industry as a whole has such an appalling image. This is precisely what we are trying to change. What is interesting, however, is that temporary work is most readily accepted by society, and is also increasing to the greatest extent in those Member States where the principle of equality applies, namely in France and the Netherlands. Of course, the employers want social acceptance as well. The main reason for using temporary agency workers – as our Foundation in Dublin found out – is not the cost savings incurred, but the option of flexible deployment during seasonal bottlenecks, as a response to personnel fluctuations, and in some cases in the extension of probationary periods. This is exactly what the European directive facilitates, with Mrs van den Burg's amendments. The necessary flexibility is further safeguarded through wage negotiations. Let us adopt this directive tomorrow and send out a clear signal that there really is such a thing as a social Europe!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a successful European project which five years ago still had a host of detractors and which has earned the right for its fame to spread beyond a handful of experts. Since 1997, around 10 million new jobs have been created. This is not enough, in terms of either quantity or quality. We agree, however, that the Employment Guidelines need to be made more efficient; they must not be extended, but they need to be more transparent and they ought to have more binding force. We do not wish, for the time being in any case, to change the pillar structure. However, we do think that it ought to be overhauled. In previous years, Parliament has often offered new suggestions with this in mind and also pointed to shortcomings. We also want the guidelines actually to be implemented. We are aware that some Member States put up so-called passive resistance to the Commission. For once this too needs to be clearly stated. The assessment of the first and fourth pillars was favourable. With your permission, I should like nevertheless to examine this with a more critical eye. On the basis of my own experience in the Member States I would say that the first pillar – employability, which deals above all with further education and training – is still far too haphazard, arbitrary and shortsighted. We need continuous professional training, and at the end of the day this means employees having a right to further training, and not only when they are 50 or 55 years old, but also when they are only 30 or 35. The fourth pillar – equal opportunities – has been warmly praised. I believe that the considerable success we have been able to see here is also due to the fact, Commissioner, that equal opportunities policy has been supported on several occasions by anti-discrimination legislation. Entrepreneurship and adaptability are still judged to be deficient. It seems to me that many employers still have not even realised that they too are expected to show flexibility and make changes. The European Social Fund is certainly an effective instrument, but we Europeans should also link it to the fulfilment of certain obligations by the Member States. We will probably not be able to manage without European sanctions in the long term. Commissioner, my group stands by your side. The national employment plans are often still seen as secret government documents, their contents unknown to national Members of Parliament and the public. That is why, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, we need codecision at EU level and legislative proposals to provoke debate and decisions at national level. As social democrats we will be happy to support you in this quest.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, and Mrs Damião, to whom many thanks for this very balanced report, I think it was not very easy to develop an approach for the future – which is what your report, my dear Elisa, has nevertheless done – from the many and various national regulatory arrangements in the EU. It is precisely because asbestos is one of the most hazardous materials to work with that the most harmful types of it have been banned in almost every country in the world. All the same, we occasionally have to contend with difficulties, and indeed with the dangers being minimised, even on a worldwide scale, as for example at present in the WTO with Canada. From 2005, there will be a ban in Europe on the use and marketing of all types of asbestos. That notwithstanding, Commissioner, we see your initiative for reform as necessary, as reform was overdue on specific points and aspects. I therefore do not understand the position of the PPE-DE Group as just put forward by Mr Pérez Álvarez. Of course it is sensible to extend protection to users and residents as well as workers. We all know schools, sports facilities, and even European Union buildings, that have had to be closed due to contamination with asbestos and then laboriously and expensively renovated. One important new essential is prevention, that is, education about the dangers of asbestos, and the greater responsibility of employers – not only the major employers, but also the small ones, including subcontractors, with atypical employment relationships of course included. That too I see as being necessary. Europe should set an example in the development and use of alternative materials. That, rather than the export of asbestos to the rest of the world, is where our future lies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had two reasons for asking these questions. First, to obtain some clarification, and second to get things moving in this whole field. Clarification, because we Members of Parliament soon realised that the contributions made by Commissioner Solbes and the representative of the Council did not make it clear why the legal basis has been changed in Article 63(4). It was simply stated, without any justification being given. Since Tampere, we have taken very seriously the Council's announcement that the legal status of third-country nationals, that is to say citizens who live and work in the EU, who are legally resident here and do not come from one of the 15 Member States, should be approximated to that of Member States' nationals. Europe's institutions want more clarity and transparency without waiting for the Convention. However, these new proposals are creating more confusion than before, because, if we have to deal with two different legal bases, that is certainly very confusing. It is also unsatisfactory because it rules out codecision by Parliament. What a short-sighted strategy on the part of the Commission! You know that up to now we have always been on your side when it comes to modernisation, to changing and improving things for Europe's employees, Europe's workers. I think it would be not only very short-sighted but also a dangerous strategy to exclude Parliament at this stage. It is of course possible for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to apply to opt out under Regulation 1408, and that would really be disastrous, because no one in this House could welcome a further social policy opt-out. The result would be a patchwork quilt of a social policy which would certain not confirm and win the trust that employees ought to have in Europe's institutions. So we are all delighted that the United Kingdom has stopped opting out of social policy. Is this an attempt to reintroduce that? The second reason for our question was of course to get the plans for reform moving. I remember that an undertaking to update this directive was given in Edinburgh back in 1992. Please note – an update. I would like to remind you once again that Regulation 1408 does not involve harmonising social systems, but is about coordinating the framework conditions, as it were, in order to encourage and support our citizens in making use of their scope for mobility in Europe. Every couple of weeks there are fresh appeals from the Council and the Commission to young people, to workers, to the public in general, to take advantage of this freedom of movement. However, I would like to say here that the framework conditions consist of some very complicated and unwieldy legislation. In Germany we would say that is a book with seven seals, a closed book if you like, even for the initiated. The 12 parameters that we now have before us do not add up to the qualitative improvement that we actually promised ourselves. I naturally agree with the critical comments made by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and also with the criticism that you expressed on behalf of the Commission, Mr Solbes. The other point I should have mentioned was the time frame. We had expected that the Spanish Presidency would have presented a methodical, reasonable and effective proposal by June.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our European constitution, our Treaties, state that we are responsible for improving the workplace environment in order to protect the health of employees. I have the impression that this has often been forgotten, especially in the context of this public debate. The ignorance of the press – sometimes the quality press – also confirms this view. In addition to the usual objections from industry, massive lobbying was, of course, carried out by the music industry as well – not the dark forces, but quite specifically the music industry. This outcry raises three interesting points. Firstly: The general public's lack of awareness that since 1986, employees in the music industry have been covered by a directive which is still in force. All employees are covered, except for seamen. This is now being rectified. Secondly: It reveals the lack of monitoring in the Member States, for if better monitoring had been carried out, the groups affected – employers and employees – would not be in such a state of shock today. Thirdly: It also shows, of course – and I say this critically – the very poor representation of employees' interests. I would like to send the Commission a copy of a letter which I received from the Swiss Musicians Federation about a hearing in 1996, which shows very clearly, Mr Pronk, that damage to hearing is always to be taken seriously, regardless of whether someone works in the construction industry, ceramics, or a music company or orchestra. (Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)
 Or even in Parliament, but fortunately, most of our colleagues are not as noisy as that! Of course, there are rules at national level. As a left-wing traditionalist, too, I believe that the state and the employer have a duty to protect workers from workplace hazards. This is precisely our task, and in my view, with this directive, we have achieved this goal.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for this fine report, which is every bit as good as its predecessor. We share her analysis and also the criticisms she has raised in the report. I wish also to thank you, Commissioner, for your ideas on the Barcelona Summit. Only this morning, I was telling a party of visitors from Bad Hersfeld how much commitment you demonstrate. Your agenda has enjoyed very strong support from Parliament, and especially from the group to which I belong, but we now expect definite proposals and initiatives, action plans and also – Mrs Smet – directives. This will not work in the complete absence of directives. Of course, we should make more use than hitherto of the new method of coordination, especially in discussions with the candidate countries. I see that as an excellent instrument for getting these countries involved right now and also giving them the opportunity to set out to us their current concerns and needs, and what they have achieved. Here too, I do not share Mrs Smet's opinion that these candidate countries lag behind on all these points. I think we urgently need a reform of the European Works Councils directive. If you have problems at the Commission, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, then just take the excellent report that Parliament produced last autumn. We must also shape social policy along precautionary lines, and not always leave it until, so to speak, the child has fallen down the well. The scandal surrounding lorry drivers in Luxembourg is only the tip of the iceberg. The head of Luxembourg's government has said that there is an urgent need for action on the part of the European Union, and perhaps we should take him at his word. The Spanish presidency is, unfortunately, rather hesitant, but, Commissioner, Parliament supports you with all the commitment it can muster.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rather strange not to have the rapporteur here but I should like to congratulate him, nonetheless, because the PSE supports his report and will accept it as it stands. We also support the Commission communication, although we take the view that listing current obstacles and postponing legislative proposals is not good enough. We hope that the relevant proposals and an efficient action plan will be submitted to us at the spring summit. One criticism we have is that the skills shortages proposed or, rather, identified in the high-tech sector are of course not good enough. As Socialists, we want to give all employees the chance to benefit from mobility and to increase mobility on the European labour markets. But we have to offer them these chances. The new labour market should not be open just to small, special groups; it must be open to every employee in Europe. Hence we need creative ideas and solutions from the Commission, not just a list of the problems. We also need a detailed investigation of possible malfunctions on the labour market in border regions or in specific sectors, such as the building and transport industries. Last but not least, we also need an analysis and a debate of the results of the school system in Europe because, unfortunately, not every country in Europe has done as well as it should.

 rapporteur
. – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, employment policy in the EU was successful last year even though not all our ambitious objectives have been achieved. But the points have been set. In few other fields do we have to think in the long term as much as in employment policy. My impression is that the Member States have not only grasped that, but that they are also acting accordingly. My report takes the same line as that of the Committee, which has kept to it over the past few years. We have always followed employment processes in the Member States and offered constructive criticism. I have therefore concentrated this year on some new key points. The first of these is the new theme of work quality, on which we in Parliament agree with the initiative of the Commission and the Belgian Presidency, which have also made the quality of work a pre-eminent item on the agenda. We are very keen that this topic should find its way into all policy areas by a kind of mainstreaming. The second key point is gender equality in the employment market. Here, too, according to the Commission's figures, we have achieved an improvement. The proportion of women in employment has increased by 2% in any case, which is of course not enough for us, but it is the right way to go, and also shows the change in the Member States' thinking. This reorientation also means – and even that was not so simple – that a change of consciousness has taken place, at least in some Member States such as Germany, Greece and Ireland. A third point is very important to me – the integration and incorporation of disadvantaged groups into the employment market. This has for some years been an important topic for this Parliament. In my report, I put forward the argument that employment policy measures should include immigrants as well. I believe this to be an important area for the future, precisely because we will otherwise be creating new social flashpoints. I would like finally to mention the area of continuing education. We had debates in Committee as to whether it made sense to demand a right to continuing education and to direct the national governments to translate it into action. I believe that, now, of all times, when we are already finding that bottlenecks in certain trades result from too little training and development in the past, such a national right to continuing education would represent the dictates of the hour. I am, moreover, convinced that we will have achieved it within four or five years. Why, then, should Parliament not be the trailblazer for once? National and European targets need to be set if these policy objectives are to be achieved. There is, I believe, an additional need for more intensive cooperation between enterprises and institutions of higher education than hitherto, in order to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer and more speedily initiate entrepreneurial innovation than has previously been the case. I appeal also to the Member States, to the Council and to the Belgian Presidency to have the courage to initiate a public debate on employment policy in Europe. The fact is that we have observed that there is in the national parliaments – with the possible exception of Denmark – and in the regional parliaments and assemblies, still, little or no, discussion of European employment policy. Even employers' organisations and trade unions, at regional level, do not know of the significance of our debates and resolutions in the European Parliament. Of course, effective employment policies and coordinated and farsighted economic and financial policies belong together. I cannot draw a veil over this Parliament's present dissatisfaction with the Council's objectives in this area and with its debates on the subject. I cannot help thinking that we could do with a bit more courage on the part of the finance ministers on the Ecofin Council, in order to guarantee here, too, the appropriate and proportionate goal for a rational European employment policy, for only then can an offensive for growth and employment in Europe be realised. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when dealing with this subject we must also inevitably return to the events in Genoa. We shall of course deal with the violation of civil rights later. This evening, I would like to touch upon the protest of ten thousand, predominantly young, people against globalisation and economic power. We must take more seriously than before their concerns surrounding the increasing division in the world between the rich and the poor and the exploitation of our natural resources. Precisely because many problems can no longer be resolved at a national level, the European Union is specifically responsible for monitoring unbridled economic and financial dealings. Up until now, the European Union has pursued this aim very hesitantly. One of several possibilities open to us is to establish the legal base for employee participation, information and consultation before decisions are taken. The European limited liability company – really an inevitable idea, and also a sensible idea in itself, within the European internal market – is however only acceptable to us as European Socialists with the appropriate inclusion of employees and their trade unions. Company decisions are therefore only really thought out if employees’ points of view are considered. Management alone cannot make important decisions. The numerous failed mergers and events at Renault Vilvoorde, Danone, Marks [amp] Spencer and in other companies in the past are, in our opinion, good evidence of this. Additionally, I would like to thank the French government for reaching a compromise and for also finally convincing Spain that this legislation must be given the green light. I would like to criticise the procedure decided on by the Council. In this regard, I share the criticism of the Committee on Legal Affairs. However, I would like to say, Mr Lehne, that I did not find the reasons you gave very convincing, since the Council has, of course, been able to count on the support of Parliament. We have also pursued this procedure rapidly and constructively in the course of the Committee’s work. It is not because of us that the procedure would have failed. So, there was essentially no reason to change the legal base. I share the criticism and think that the Council should consider this carefully and also stipulate their reasoning, for we have not, to date, actually heard the reason for changing the legal base. I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Menrad for working rapidly and constructively with us in the Committee on Social Affairs to bring this report to the vote. I would also like to thank him for being more specific in response to proposals from my group. However, I believe, Mr Menrad, that we are agreed that we must not adopt Amendment No 12. I have at any rate recommended this to my group. Finally, I would refer to the appeal to secure a majority of votes tomorrow to enable this ship – as one member put it – to be launched on its maiden voyage, despite some reservations and also in spite of some inconsistencies, which we could not allow to go unmentioned. I think, however, that it would be sensible to bring in a law that takes employees into consideration and includes their interests in time for the introduction of the euro. The planned revision does not need to be deferred for six years. We can certainly carry this out earlier.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regulated working times mean better protection for workers. There is hardly a sector in which this is more pertinent than the transport sector. I should like to reiterate the objective of this directive. Article 1 states that the purpose of the directive is to provide better protection for the safety and health of drivers, improve road safety and bring about more harmonised conditions of competition. I think that the common position does not do this justice; in fact, it even contains a number of inherent contradictions. Our rapporteur has made proposals which make a sensible contribution to transport policy and environmental policy over and above this. I should like to raise three points on which we disagree with the Council. The most important point – as already mentioned – is to include self-employed drivers. You are wrong, Mr Bushill-Matthews, to say that self-employed drivers and haulage companies are all opposed to Stephen Hughes’ proposal. A whole series of companies has readily recognised that the competition will be ruinous if self-employed drivers are not included. Allow me to reiterate the consequences: if the one-third of the 3.5 million truck drivers who are self-employed are excluded, we shall see thousands of drivers turned into unwilling, bogus self-employed drivers overnight. I cannot believe that they will agree to this. The second point on which we disagree is night work: we should remember that most serious accidents on European roads are caused not by technical faults but by overtired drivers, which is why we think that eight hours is long enough at the wheel. My third point concerns standby duty, i.e. the time during which drivers must be ready to take up work. We think that flexible working times should be in the interest of both sides, i.e. the employer or haulier and the employee, which is why we feel that a day's notice is a sensible solution. However, Mrs Smet, this calls for intelligent logistics. We cannot simply allow the current method, the current practice of shifting stock on to the road at the expense of the truck drivers' standby duty, to continue. We need a reasonable, new, practical solution and I think that is precisely what Stephen Hughes gives us in his report.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could not fail to endorse Mr von Wogau’s last sentence. On the whole, however, I do not believe that his report is as balanced as he presented it here. First of all, on behalf of my committee I must criticise the lack of opportunity we were given to cooperate on this report, to engage in proper parliamentary discussion and to draft an opinion. Public acceptance of the euro and of European economic policy, Mr von Wogau, will not simply depend on the coining of a new term such as ‘home market’ or the like. It will take a bit more than that to convince people. This point is emphasised in the opinion which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted by a large majority. Let me cite some examples of the interaction and evidence of reliability that are needed. Of course we need stability, but, as you well know, we also need more extensive investments in education and science. We call for an increase in the activity rate, especially with regard to women, yet we do not provide sufficient childcare facilities throughout the Union. We have naturally looked long and hard at demographic trends in all 15 Member States and now in the applicant countries too, yet our health services and our care services for the elderly still leave much to be desired. Growth alone, as our committee noted very clearly, cannot guarantee the quality of jobs. All of these improvements are necessary to ensure that our economic and monetary policies win the approval of the general public and of the working people of Europe. I am pleased to see that some Member States – and I believe this is underestimated by the Commission and its Economic Policy Committee – are working to improve and intensify the participation of employees in economic life, as demonstrated by the legislative bills that have been introduced in France and Germany, for example. It is also interesting that a number of Member States have already responded to the proposals that Parliament and the Commission have been making for some time – they are not being tabled for the first time today – such as the long-overdue opportunity for older employees to upgrade their qualifications rather than being more or less squeezed out of the labour market with the aid of statutory provisions as in past years. Lastly, let me point out that our committee was scathingly critical of the Council’s dilatory implementation of the Lisbon strategy. The economic policy of the Union must clearly be consistent with the principles of its employment policy and the social agenda. I wish to thank my fellow committee members for the flexible and constructive manner in which they dealt with the drafting of an opinion in such unusual circumstances.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make two points. The first of these concerns Mrs Lambert’s report, which is sensible and pragmatic and contains the necessary changes in the light of the annual updates. This is a technical report and the Group of the Party of European Socialists thinks it right and proper that it has been separated from our political reports. For this very reason, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I do not understand your outburst. I think you are getting worked up about a report which really does not warrant it and that you are putting the rapid harmonisation of legislation in jeopardy. The position we have adopted, which is one we have held for the last six years and more in our committee, is, quite understandably, to secure the right to freedom of movement, the rights of frontier workers and also the rights of third-country nationals whose families are in Europe, as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. That is why the position of the Council seems to me somewhat lacking. But our motion for a resolution, which we tabled together with the other left-wing groups of this House, contains a clear and, I think, urgent request for the Council to lay the directives, the regulation and the revision of the regulation on the table by the end of the year. From what I have heard, I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will follow suit. Mrs Ria, I regret, therefore, your zigzag course. When we look at your proposals, we find they do not tally with what you have said. For instance, in Amendment No 1 on paragraph a, why did you remove social security? We all want social security to remain a component; we do not want only economic interests to be to the fore. In the case of Amendment No 4 to paragraph 1, you have removed third-country nationals. That is a big problem. It has always been close to our hearts that we are dealing not only with the citizens of the European Union but also with workers and people from other countries, who are legally resident in our countries. That is why we expect you to include these groups of people. You can be sure that this problem will return to haunt us at the time of enlargement – but probably sooner – namely when the glaring deficit in qualified workers, which will make itself felt in all 15 Member States, is all too apparent. We cannot restrict legal status to workers; we must also include workers’ families. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations, one being Anna Lancker, for her outstanding report, and the other being Anna Diamantopoulou, for her outstanding submission. It is an ambitious agenda, and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection. The Council was not even prepared to discuss the matter at the time. What is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy, based on the Lisbon Decisions, indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature. We do not want over-regulation – and I say this to the British delegate who spoke before – but the diversity of modern contracts of employment requires new forms of social protection, and not the rules of the nineteenth century. We also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy, and, not least, from developing the social economy and the services sector. What is not so new, and the subject of repeated demands, is lifelong learning – which is something even the smallest Member States have done something about – as are the long overdue reforms to the European factory committee law, the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers, and freedom of movement. I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work, employee participation and labour relations. Of course, I was delighted to see the French Presidency show such commitment to the issues of childcare, family and women’s policy. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that all three people responsible – in the Commission, Parliament and the Council – are women. But what we need now, in tandem with this, are instruments that allow for the involvement of fathers. That would be a new departure. Besides, this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate countries, and I therefore wish it every success.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, working time policy – as we can see once again – is not economic policy, it is health and safety at work policy. When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money. I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then. Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany. It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids. One does not exclude the other. We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now. They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation. We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems. Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity. I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight. The results are acceptable. I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to. But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council. I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission.
Weiler (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to respond to you straightaway, Mr Karas. The Socialists in this House want the internal market too. We too are campaigning for and arguing in favour of the euro, but we want a social market economy and not a US-style market economy. In any case, hitherto this House was agreed, with a few exceptions, that we did not wish to model ourselves on America, but that we wanted Europe to pursue a different path, hence my disappointment at the fact that we are unlikely to reach a consensus of opinion. We have seen, Mr Mann, that it will not be enough to deliver fine appeals and issue demands, for what we need are quantifiable objectives. This method has proved its worth as regards the euro and is proving its worth at the moment as far as measures to combat youth unemployment are concerned. All 15 countries have instituted specific measures to this end and there will be a need for this across the board.   We are also expecting that in future there will be a more comprehensive debate on employment policy in the Member States, involving the two sides of industry, regional partners, those in charge at local level – for that is not yet the case – and of course we expect – and we are also agreed on this – that there will be socio-political convergence, in the light of modernisation of the social systems of course. But when Mr von Wogau says that we are way behind on the reform front in Europe then I am left wondering whom he is actually comparing us with. Surely not with Japan? And surely you do not seriously mean the American system? Take a look at the health care system there. Nowhere in Europe is it as expensive as it is in America, or as ghastly. And of course we want to afford women opportunities on the labour market. Insufficient consideration has been given to this aspect in the various employment policy options as well.   Finally, there is one point which I will agree with you on, namely that concerning qualifications. It is indeed a shortcoming that Germany is having to bring in experts from Asia and India. We ought to have begun attending to the question of qualifications and training opportunities years ago. Unfortunately, however, Germany has rested on its laurels in this respect over the last 16 years.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Menrad. His report provides a helpful basis which, it also has to be said, has been very greatly improved upon by our shadow rapporteur Anna Van Lancker. As for the Liberals who have spoken, I would like to tell them that their theory that Europe does not need an employment policy comes five years too late. European employment policy has already undeniably demonstrated its value. Various analyses have shown that the Member States have taken many sensible initiatives, that they are taking workers’ initial and further training more seriously than before and that new jobs have been created by means of this employment policy, and above all, Mr Brie, in the services sector. Our committee does not want to see new jobs in services with pay below the poverty level, as in America – we want quality employment in services also closely linked with production. It is possible to criticise the policy adopted up to now, especially the measures taken by Member States. We are not being persistent enough in fighting the exclusion of older workers, and it is evident that in all Member States, even in Sweden, women do not participate to the same extent in working life. It seems to me that despite the Employment Pact, despite the social dialogue, employers – businesses – are totally ignoring this issue. There is an urgent need for them to become involved, and financially too! It is not acceptable for the financing of employment policy to be a matter solely for the Member States and solely for the European Union. Furthermore, both sides of industry must of course be involved in the process of renewing and modernising employment in the Member States. Involving employees and keeping them informed is a prerequisite for this. The Commission needs to play a more active role here, because there is still a great deal to be done in this area, as we saw in last week’s debate on Michelin. It is essential for the European Parliament to be involved in the guidelines, that much we agree upon. It is, however, also essential, as Anna Van Lancker has already said, to have specific, measurable benchmarks for the guidelines. That is why we are tabling these amendments. I have to say that I totally fail to comprehend why our Conservative friends do not want to support measurable benchmarks for the Member States, for example increasing the employment rate or achieving a specific reduction in long-term unemployment over five years. You will even be helping the Socialist and Social-Democrat heads of government in a way that could scarcely have been expected! Finally, I would like to mention – since our Conservative friend has already told us this – that the euro is probably also a successful example of employment policy. All Member States have worked to comply with the stability criteria, as have those countries that wish to join the European Union. We also need these specific criteria for employment policy.
Weiler (PSE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, I believe that the gentleman who spoke before me is right about one point. If it were in fact the case that the market could regulate itself, then we should not today be speaking about Michelin. It is also a spectacular mistake, Mr Pronk, to believe that this is not an issue for this House. We spoke here a number of years ago about Renault, too, and also quite rightly. 7,500 jobs are being destroyed, and that is an especially negative record for a company to set here.  Secondly, we must talk about this matter here because employees in Europe expect us, the European Union, to direct the process of globalisation and to regulate necessary modernisation and companies’ adjustments to the market in intelligent ways, that is to say in ways which take the social contract into account. The European Union has a number of directives for doing this which, however, are being applied all too cautiously here. It seems to me to be symptomatic of Michelin’s policy as a company that it is only at the end of this year that it has established a European Works Committee.  There will be further economic changes in the EU but, for us Social Democrats, it should go without saying that employees and their unions are to be included in this process, that they are to be informed of developments in good time and that their proposals are to be examined seriously. If, Commissioner, you will be sharpening the tools available to the EU, we shall most certainly support you and accompany you in the process. I should like to express my thanks to those of Michelin’s employees who are here today. I should also like to have seen that kind of commitment from the owners. A rise in profits for the first six months of over 17% is really excellent, but these profits ought to be invested by the companies in new products, new environmentally friendly production methods and, above all, in employee training too. That would be a contribution to social peace, and the share markets would then have every good reason to see an increase in value.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin where Mr Chichester left off, that is that we cannot proceed fast enough with opening the energy markets. I believe we in this Parliament have been united on that for quite some time. May I remind you that last year, after more than two years’ intensive work, we adopted directives to accelerate the opening of both the electricity and the gas markets in Europe. I must say, however, that I and a few others, too, were then rather surprised at how quickly this follow-up proposal for a regulation concerning gas transmission networks has come. We are surprised because the time allowed for the Member States to implement the directive has not yet expired – it will do so in a few weeks’ time – and also because we have set a very ambitious timetable for the Commission to submit an evaluation report on the application and implementation of the directive; it was to happen in 2006. So much for the background. I want to raise three points which, I fully admit, have left me rather sceptical. Firstly, the compatibility between this regulation and the directive we adopted. Secondly, the justification the Commission has given, which I have not exactly found in the text, namely that the emphasis should be placed on cross-border trade. The third point that has made me rather sceptical was the proposal for a very wide-ranging comitology procedure. Now, after a long discussion, as the rapporteur said, we have agreed to continue working on the Commission’s approach. We have therefore proposed a number of amendments in the three areas I have just mentioned. So far as my group is concerned, the outcome is that we support the package as a whole. That is not the end of my group’s work, however. We are waiting to see what the Council does and then there will be the second reading, but we shall continue to back here in plenary these 42 amendments that were adopted in committee, and we hope that this will bring us a little further forwards in the opening of the energy markets.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would be quite happy to agree with the points Mr Karas has just made, for there is little to be objected to in what he said, but, nevertheless, if we carry on debating with each other much longer – as the members of the committee already have been – very profound differences will keep on cropping up here and there, and I think we have to say something about these in order to understand each other a bit better. What is clear is that competition policy is an important and indispensable instrument, enabling the European internal market to function and facilitating ever-deeper integration, so that the gains in terms of prosperity and efficiency resulting from a large and integrated market can be put to good use. I called competition policy an instrument, and that is what it is, rather than an end in itself; if it were an end in itself, it would very rapidly degenerate into something purely ideological. Competition policy is an instrument that has to be subject to social and civil policy objectives and must help achieve them. The fact is, then, that we do not live and move in a free market economy, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ draft resolution puts it, but in an environmentally-responsible and social market economy. Mr Karas, you have just used the term ‘social market economy’, but you voted against it in the committee. It is astonishing how the Conservatives and Christian Democrats in this House have refused to talk in terms of the social market economy, and I can tell the Members on the other side of the House that they can correct their group’s embarrassing mistake in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in tomorrow’s plenary vote, by voting in favour of our amendments. Although we are in favour of tight controls on mergers, their strength must lie in their taking into account their effects on society and on employment and in their giving workers and those who represent their interests a say in decision-making processes. That is a suggestion for the Commissioner. We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are also in favour of tight controls on subsidies, but subsidies can be eminently justifiable if they lead to modernisation, improved competitiveness, innovation, sustainable growth and the creation of long-term employment. What I would like to see is even greater attention being given, when assessing subsidies, to the effects – including the positive ones – on the whole chain of exploitation within which the subsidy is made. We have already had a whole series of debates on this. My time is running out, so I will end with a question to the Commissioner. Commissioner Monti, you have now become acquainted with our resolution – from the last part-session in Strasbourg – on services of general interest, in which we spoke out plainly in favour of codecision by this House on a legal framework, which means that it cannot be regarded as assent only to a block exemption regulation – which is the impression I got from the Commission’s reaction. We have also asked whether there is to be a follow-up within the life of this Parliament, which has not much longer left to run. We cannot have any more long-drawn-out discussions, and so I would like to know how work on this within the Commission is progressing.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not for the first time, but yet again, the debate on the Green Paper shows that services of general interest, the way in which they are provided and structured, are more than ever in the spotlight, not only in terms of political debate but also of the European public’s concerns about universal access to services. For us in this Group of the Party of European Socialists, they are an indispensable component of any model of European society – I will explicitly use the word ‘component’, as this is not about developing a European model for services of general interest; they are an essential and elemental component in a European social model with objectives common to all European societies. They play a crucial part in improving the quality of life for all citizens and in overcoming economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation. This is where I want to attempt to clear up a misunderstanding. This is not about our having the market and competition on the one hand and services of general interest on the other. Services of general interest can perfectly well be provided by market instruments in a competitive context, but we have to take note of the fact that there are also situations in which the market does not provide such services efficiently, and that is when the democratic community has to be able to ensure that such services can be provided outside the market’s machinery. This interaction highlights our need for a bit more legal clarity. That is why our group endorses the rapporteur’s thinking on this, and this is where I too want to extend warm thanks to Mr Herzog, who really has done everything possible to bring about compromise; even though he is the rapporteur, he has changed his position in essential areas, and I think it is rather a pity, in view of this achievement, this attempt at consensus, that there are elements in this House that have quite simply refused to give him credit for it. We endorse the report because we need it if we are to have legal certainty and a common legal framework within which these issues can be dealt with, but, above all else, we want Parliament to have a part in it, and on that point I want to say something in response to Mr Langen’s statement that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, in the meantime, come to an agreement that they do not want a framework directive after all, on the grounds that Article 95 does not allow it. I do not see that such is the case at all; you decided that you did not want one, and the reason why you did so was that a majority of you no longer saw it as politically acceptable. For whatever reasons you did this, we can understand them, we can live with them, but please do not try to tell me that it cannot be done for lack of suitable legal basis. That has never bothered us before, and quite right too; when we wanted to get something done politically, we found the legal basis for doing so, and, as the Commission is a veritable master at doing this sort of thing, now is the time for us to support it in finding one. There is absolutely no doubt about the fact we want it, but Parliament’s right of codecision must be safeguarded if we do. Of course, a legal framework of this sort needs to contain some substance, and I urge that we should, in future, spend more time discussing substance than this or that legal basis. That is what our debates should be about; there is a whole range of items that have to be embedded in a framework of this sort, and I want to list just six of them. As I have already said, the framework directive must aim to give the stakeholders legal security when current Community law is applied to what they do. There is, quite clearly, no disagreement about the fact that the actual definition, structure, organisation and funding of services of general interest lie within the remit of the Member States and their sub-divisions – that is, of course, the municipalities, where these have the relevant competence. It follows that it is not worth working towards a uniform and all-embracing European definition, but there are a number of standards and a few criteria that of course amount to the same thing and that also have to be embedded in it. Universality, for example, is one of them, as are also continuity, the quality of the service, efficiency, affordability and also the involvement of the users and the democratic supervision of the service providers. Far more than was the case in the past, we have to concentrate on the actually essential point: when is an activity economic and when is it not? That is the yardstick by which we determine whether or not the rules on competition or the internal market should apply, and I see this as the area in which we should pursue the debate. So, the situation being as it is, we say ‘yes’ to a legal framework of this kind, and let us discuss its substance rather than any legal bases. (Applause)

 Madam President, in my contribution to this debate, I want to concentrate on the subject of the gas supply directive, as Mr Karlsson, the rapporteur on crude oil, has had his group’s agreement when dealing with this topic. I do not therefore think that there is anything further to be added to what he had to say. Commissioner De Palacio, you threw into the scales a very weighty argument in favour of the directive: the protection of the consumer and of security of supply. Faced with so substantial an argument, one is almost inclined to shrink back and deny that any criticism of this directive was intended. After all, who would object to the consumer being protected or to the security of the energy supply? The question does not even arise. I get the impression, though, that this is where the Commission has chosen the wrong track. I have to tell you, Commissioner, that I believe that we achieved a good result when we worked together on the directives for streamlining electricity and gas, but I think that we have less common ground on this one. I want quite explicitly to refer back to what the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, has told us. I can agree with it almost without reservation. I think that the reason why you chose the wrong track was that security of supply simply cannot be defined and organised supranationally. Security of supply has to be adapted, on a regional basis and dynamically, to incessant fluctuations in demand, which increases and diminishes. The differing framework conditions existing in the Member States call for individually-tailored measures on the part of the Member States themselves and of the supply companies involved. What is decisive is not the imposition of a single European standard, but flexible use of the infrastructure, diversity of sources, and the way contracts are framed. What I find particularly disturbing, though, is the false political message that I believe this draft directive is sending out. What, then, is the actual occasion for a directive of this kind? Unlike with oil, there have been to date no major crises in the supply of natural gas, nor is there any cause for concern that one is to be expected in the foreseeable future. As has already been said, it was only a few weeks ago that we adopted, with a great deal of consensus, the directive on the internal market in natural gas. There were those who said that, by opening up the market, we were jeopardising the security of energy supply; are we not now proving that they were right? Why do we not let the opening up of the market do its work? It is itself a contribution to the security of supply and directly involves enterprises in sharing responsibility for it. It appears to me that the draft put before us undermines the elements in the internal market directive that deal with competition. I include myself among those who took the view that the draft directive should be sent back. Now, for tactical reasons, I recommend another course of action. In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we had a discussion with Mr Blokland, and came to a broad agreement. All I fear, ladies and gentlemen, is that the Council is not entirely to be relied on, in that members of it are always signalling that they do not want the directive the way it is, but we never get any firm statement to that effect. For that reason, I fear that, if we now send the directive back and the Council nonetheless adopts a Common Position – which it can of course do – we will be pretty defenceless when it comes to Second Reading. That is why I recommend that we should take the approach to the gas supply directive suggested by the rapporteur, and which, after all, we agreed on with an overwhelming consensus in committee. Then we will see what further progress we can make at Second Reading stage.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making the point with which my friend Mr Turmes concluded his speech, namely that we owe a debt of gratitude to our fellow rapporteurs and to the shadow rapporteurs. We have a total of two years of work behind us, and I have found the cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs right across the groups to be highly collegial, very frank and full of trust, something I believe to be reflected in the outcome that we have achieved. I think this is a good result. Let me make four observations following on from what Mr Turmes has just said, with which I can only agree. Firstly, this legislative package opens up the way for more competition in Europe’s energy markets. In opening up the way for a truly integrated internal market in energy, we are making a contribution – our contribution – towards our shared goal of making the European Union the most competitive region in the world. We have to make use of the efficiency gains arising from an integrated internal market and its capacity for bringing about political integration in order to achieve this goal, but also especially so that our small and medium-sized enterprises should benefit from this internal market, and so that other consumers benefit more than they have done in the past from its outcomes and from its positive effects. Secondly, the essential consequence of previous directives on the internal market was that markets were opened up in an unbalanced way. They certainly brought about greater competitiveness, enhanced efficiency and reduced prices, but the unbalanced development of the opened markets and substantial deficiencies in the detailed rules mean that we now have to enact specific measures to speed up the process of opening up markets still further. This means that we have to ensure equal conditions for all participants in the market, minimise the danger of the market being dominated, and, as far as possible, put a stop to predatory practices, for example those engaged in by the big players to the detriment of small enterprises. The fact is that we are not aiming at the replacement of public monopolies by private ones, but at a wide-open internal market in energy. My third point is, therefore, indisputable. An essential component of what we have submitted to the vote in this House is to lay down an ambitious timetable for the complete opening-up of the market. The timetable that we have now laid down jointly with the Council is ambitious, and, if we can make it work, this will be a great leap forward in comparison with what we have had so far. My fourth point is that the access of third parties to the network – competition, in other words – has to be regulated, with transparency but without discrimination. One of the essentials for this is unbundling, the use of company law to unbundle the network from production on the one hand and retailing on the other. We need one or more regulatory authorities with supervisory capacity, with the capacity and obligation to report, but, above all, the power to give instructions and the capacity to impose sanctions. We have also established the need for the State to be able to impose obligations for the general benefit without at the same time nullifying competition. Although the basis on which this will be done is laid down in an appropriate way in the directives that we will be voting on the day after tomorrow, it remains incumbent on the Commission to keep a very watchful eye on market developments. It is the Commission that must take appropriate measures to prohibit anti-competitive conduct by companies, and, above all, the Commission that must see to it that the Member States transpose the directive properly and promptly. It must be conceded that the Council has, in the informal trilogue, moved some way from its original position and closer to that of Parliament, but that was urgently necessary in view of the fact that a number of detailed rules in one or more of the Common Positions were, in my view, somewhat problematic, containing openings whereby competition might be nullified. The tight time-frame therefore means that prompt transposition is of the essence; everything has to be transposed into national law within the space of a year. With reference to this, I want again to make it clear that it is for the Commission to monitor the market and the terms of competition. Let me again underline what Mr Turmes has just said, that the internal market in energy must be subject to Treaty competition law and must be evaluated by reference to it. The Treaty instruments must be applicable to it, especially where state subsidies and the control of mergers are concerned, and I think that, on this issue, the Commission can depend upon the political support not only of my group – I can promise them that – but also of this House as a whole.

 Mr President, I hope that the Commissioner will not hold it against me for saying this – it is not intended personally – but what you gave us today as a statement from the Commission was vacuous, every bit as vacuous as the documents you have sent to us – and I emphasise ‘us’, as I am referring to Parliament – over the past few weeks. I will shortly be saying something about the existence of other documents that are worth talking about and discussing, but first I will turn to the documents and the statement that you have given us. You started by mentioning in your introduction that we are engaged in a discussion, and one that is being conducted in a very open way. At any rate, that is how it came across when interpreted into German. What do you mean by 'open'? Open as regards the possible outcome or open in the way the discussion is conducted? Both interpretations make me uneasy. With an open outcome? We have already moved on too far for that. Now you issue a Green Paper, which I see as nothing more than a means of creating a smokescreen while there are other decisions that urgently need to be taken. This is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything, whilst, at the same time, very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas. Nor is the discussion being conducted in an open manner, for, as I have just told you, we have been given your statement on behalf of the Commission, along with documents of four or five pages each, not that the number of pages is of great importance. Yet, while we are given these documents, others are getting what are described as ‘non-papers’ – substantial documents that are really worth discussing, and in which we could find that there is legal certainty on specific points. Take the so-called non-paper dated 12 November, with its margin numbers – all 102 of them! You discuss these things with others, but not with us. I just want to pick up one point and be told what the Commission really thinks about it. Item 100 says: ‘An enterprise may provide more than one service to the public, some of them realising a profit and others showing a loss. Even if the enterprise does not provide public services, its services may cross-subsidise each other’. What that means is that, if we get an answer, we would be resolving an important financial issue, one that would help bring legal certainty. What we need right now is an answer and not this or that Green Paper, which serve only to delay the discussion process for ever and a day.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see we have before us a whole host of topical matters and decisions related to competition policy. Given the short time available to me, I will have to confine myself to state aid policy and therefore to Mr Herzog's report, which we Social-Democrats fully support. Allow me first to make a comment, Commissioner: do not be too disconcerted by what the previous speaker has just said. This really is far removed from what the vast majority of Members of this Parliament thinks. I believe that the vote on the two reports later on will also show that we do not agree with what has just been said. As I have already mentioned, we endorse this report by Mr Herzog on state aid, which supports the strict policy of state aid control that is implemented by the Commission on the basis of the treaties. It is a balanced report, which points out that state aid policy also has to meet other EU objectives, in particular competitiveness, growth and employment, and this in accordance with the Lisbon strategy. That is why I am very pleased, Commissioner, that you also mentioned this principle explicitly in your introductory remarks and expressed your support for it. It is good that there has again been a decline in state aid. This is the result of the Commission's tough aid control policy. Because not only do these aids carry a risk of distorting the market, but also aid must of course, in each instance, first be obtained from elsewhere and may then be lacking in another area. Neither can they be rejected wholesale, however. Instead qualitative criteria must be used to assess each grant of aid to ascertain whether the objective sought might not justify distortions to the market, which may be limited in time, or whether these measures might even eliminate existing distortions to the market in the medium term. In this context, Commissioner, I should like to recall two points, in connection with which I asked questions and made requests during a debate on the same subject all of a year ago. It is true that the most competitive region, which is of course what we want to be, has to distinguish itself by having competitive companies. This means that the companies should manage as far as possible without aids and that any aids have to be directed at increasing the competitiveness of these companies. In the process, however, it is not only the individual company that needs to be assessed; the entire net product chain of which the company is part needs to be taken into account. If you wish to apply qualitative criteria it is not enough to focus solely on one single company. My second point concerns a request that I wish to make in the field of regional policy. Today we are already discussing how regional policy will actually work after 2006. Much will change for the present EU of 15, for the old Member States, and it is right that it should. But in this context we really do need to consider how we are going to rebalance regional aids across the Member States. We need to discuss this and we need to do it in good time. We might conclude that everything can stay the same, but we might also conclude that we need a new mechanism of some kind. Do not make us wait until the end; let us start this discussion now!

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by making a point of thanking Mr Beysen. It is unlike me to start a speech by congratulating the rapporteur, because I think that is what we are here for and we generally make a good job of it. I think, however, that Mr Beysen deserves special praise for his hard work in contacting the other groups right from the start, in order to ensure the report was as unanimous as possible before it was tabled in plenary. And he has succeeded admirably. So thank you for involving us from the outset. As a result, my group feels there is no need to table any amendments because, in my opinion, what Mr Beysen has done is fine as it is. I would therefore like to just comment briefly on three political points that are important to me. First, as the Commissioner made clear, this decision comes under the general heading of the liberalisation of the energy market; in other words, it contributes to what is already on the Council's agenda. And when it comes to the overall package to open up the energy market, let there be no mistake, we have handed our homework in on time. We adopted our first reading here in plenary on 13 March, after the Council urged us to get a move on. The Commission did likewise; it too has done its homework, unlike the Council. The Council is doing what it always does, what it does best – nothing at all. It sits and talks and fails to come to any decision. That amounts to institutionalised indecisiveness, and that is why we need to say at this juncture: this is an overall package and we want results so that we can move forward. Secondly, I really do think the Commission was right in this context to suggest – and our resolution should reflect this – that strategically important projects in the trans-European energy network sector should be given top priority. By which we mean projects which are vital for security of supply, strategically important projects which are important in opening up the market, especially those relating to one part of this package I referred to, namely the regulation on which Mr Mombaur acted as rapporteur. It is a pity he is not here today; I think he too would have had a few comments to make here. Thirdly, unlike traffic networks, the industry and companies involved in the energy networks generally make real money. They make money! And that means that it is primarily up to the industry to finance these projects. It is our job as legislator to support this by putting framework conditions in place, which brings me back to the fact that the Council needs to wrap things up. So that is how we want to go about this, by cofinancing support but with the companies in the front row when it comes to putting money in the kitty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the proposal for a regulation, which the Commission submitted almost a year ago now, is a good and reasonable compromise between the conflicting interests that there have been in the Commission and in the Member States. What shows that it is not such a bad compromise is the fact that these conflicting interests and views were also, of course, present in Parliament and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and our agreeing, the second time around, to support this very Commission proposal, which is nearly a year old, says something about the proposal. We – by which I mean my group – will in any case, when we eventually come to vote, be supporting it without amendment, and we will keep to what we agreed in committee. That notwithstanding, whereas Mr Novelli made a few critical comments from his standpoint, I do so, of course, from my own, for any agreement on the details does not indeed prevent us from having outlooks that differ overall. If the translation is accurate, Mr Novelli, you twice spoke in terms of the Commission proposal envisaging the cessation of production subsidies in 2007. That is not actually the case; rather, production subsidies are to continue until 2010. That is right and proper. Closure aid is to come to an end in 2007. I do, though, have a small problem with that, in that, in view of our desire for a strategic base of this sort and, of course in retrospect, the need for capacity to be adjusted as well, I can very well imagine that we will also need aid for closure and reconstruction, especially if it is maintained that this base, too, has to be underpinned by laws on the grant of aid. No single Member State, no matter which one, can do as it pleases about this, but it must, both before and after 2010, be monitored by the Commission in accordance with the laws on subsidies. I have a few difficulties with the phasing out of aid as well. It is indeed the case that they have to be marked down on a sliding scale. What the Commission is proposing appears to me to be a bit too mechanical. On this point, I would recommend to the Council that they should just think a bit about whether they can refer back to what the ECJ decided when they ruled on the subject in 1998. My last point has to do with the clause about the post-2007 assessment, which was mentioned in the proposal. We should think again about that as well; otherwise, our approval of the Commission proposal is unconditional. (Applause)

 Mr President, going through the voting list again with the rapporteur a moment or two ago, we came across a problem that affects the voting procedure. After consultation, we have decided that we want to substitute the PPE-DE's Amendment No 9 for the first part of what we decided on in committee. If we go through the voting list accordingly, we run the risk, if we adopt part of Amendment No 22, of Amendment No 9 being disposed of. That, at any rate, is what is in the voting list. We have agreed – and I think the rapporteur will confirm this, as we have just been discussing it – that we will vote down the first part of what we decided on in committee, that is, Amendment No 22, agree to the second part, and then vote for the PPE-DE's Amendment No 9 as well, in order to scrap the first part, which we have rejected.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. You have now received the praises of three Members and it will probably come as a surprise to you when I join them in their praises. Yes, I too must compliment you on having basically made a move in the right direction with this initiative, because the old block exemption regulation, for all its good points, is quite simply and painfully out of date. It has proven to have so many shortcomings that we really do need to make a clean sweep here. But you also resisted the temptation to say, let us do away with the block exemption regulation altogether. No, you have submitted a proposal which, to my mind, really does have a great deal to commend it: multiple brand sales, for example, the abolition of the compulsory linking of sales and servicing, which can now be unbundled, more independent workshops, independent spare part manufacturers and much more besides. On balance, this is the way towards more competition as the consumer understands it. But, surprise, surprise, the devil is in the detail and needless to say, fault can be found on a few counts. But, let me be perfectly clear, we are talking about details and I think, after a long debate in committee, we have reached a good compromise in several areas, for which we have the rapporteur to thank. However, I must say, Commissioner, as you know, I have reservations on one point and that is the location clause. As I am sure you realise, there are several ways of looking at this clause. You say – the Commission says – that what is being proposed here is good for competition and will slash prices. I have my doubts. I wonder if what is being proposed really is competition and if it really will improve competition. Because what is being proposed here means quite simply that manufacturers will pick and choose and limit the number of sales. From that point of view, there is little difference in comparison with the old system, except that they really will be able to compete with each other. What sounds perfectly plausible and reasonable to start with may harbour a huge risk; because it is a closed circle, the big fish will be able to eat up the little fish. That is what worries me; that the end result will be that the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sales sector will be the first to go, eaten up by the large companies and resulting in more concentration even more quickly than is presently the case. That may cause prices to rise again at a later date, due to a lack of competition. That is why we have not suggested doing away with the whole idea. What we are saying is, let us include it in the regulation but postpone it. Then we really can look at it again in the light of specific events and decide whether or not to stick with it.

 Mr President, we have of course made some decisions about the electricity part that mean we now have to be careful not to contradict the gas part too much. That is why I would like to speak at three different stages: first now about the block vote, then later on about Amendment No 162 and then once again on amendments Nos 149 and 184. These are not comments on the substance, but rather comments about the adjustments. I would like at this point to comment on the first block: we have just rejected the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party's Amendment No 173 in a roll-call vote. The problem that we have here is that in committee we did not make a decision on this subject as regards electricity, but we did in the case of gas. The Liberal Group has now tried, in parallel, to do the same thing for electricity as we have already done for gas. We rejected that. However, we now have Amendment No 147, which belongs to this block, and which covers exactly the same substantive point that we rejected in the case of electricity. We are bringing forward something for gas that we do not want to bring forward in the case of electricity – the progress of market opening, as proposed by the committee. However, we still want to defer the opening of the gas market somewhat as compared with electricity. We are now creating an inconsistency around precisely this point. That means that by analogy we should be opposing Amendment No 147, but I simply do not know how we do that procedurally speaking, because in the voting list that is included in the block. That is why you, Mr President, have to decide now whether we should take Amendment No 147 out and vote on it separately; in that case, by analogy with the vote just taken, it would also have to be rejected. I hope that was confusing enough for you! (Laughter)
Rapkay (PSE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, this a bit simpler than just now. It is just about correcting something. The intention of Amendment No 162, a joint PSE and PPE-DE amendment, is to bring what we agreed for electricity in line with what we are now agreeing on for gas. It is word for word what we agreed earlier on for electricity. But because of the way the voting list works, that means that we first have to vote against the committee's amendment and then vote for Amendment No 162. However, a mistake has crept in along the way. This is exactly what we agreed for electricity on Article 8(5). Amendment No 162 now also reads "Article 8(5)". However, for gas it is not Article 8(5) but Article 7a(1), and so of course that needs to be inserted there from the Minutes; this is just a technical adjustment. (Applause)
Rapkay (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, this is about another adjustment, but this is rather more complicated than the one we had just now. (Laughter)
 You do not really need to listen at all, just do as I suggest, that will make things perfectly simple! (Laughter)
 But enough joking. We have just voted on the relevant part in relation to electricity. This is found in the committee's amendment. The amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party attempts to remove the discrepancies between Article 14, which relates to the gas sector, and Article 22. I must say that this is certainly necessary if we are to be rigorous here. However, if we now only voted on the PPE-DE's amendment, the key point concerning the electricity sector would be lost. Conversely, if we were to vote as shown here in the voting list, according to which if Amendment No 149 is accepted Amendment No 184 becomes redundant, then we would once again have the problem of a lack of consistency with the other article. That is the reason for the following proposal, and I have agreed this with the mover, who can confirm this. We should first of all vote on Amendment No 149 from the committee, and the PPE-DE Group will then withdraw its amendment except for the part that eliminates this inconsistency. This would then be added to Amendment No 149. We would then have eliminated the inconsistency between electricity and gas and the internal inconsistency in the case of gas. (Applause)

 Mr President, your reminder a moment ago to us to keep strictly to our speaking time leads me to make my fundamental observation and ask all of you in the Bureau to give consideration to how Parliament works. The law we are drafting will completely overhaul the market in energy, which is one of the key markets in Europe, one that is worth billions, and we allow each rapporteur to speak for just five minutes – five minutes in which we really cannot make any sensible points. That, then, we even have to divide up again between the two rapporteurs, because, strictly speaking, we have only one directive, but its two dossiers mean that there are two rapporteurs. The Commissioner, who is just entering the Chamber, will then have the opportunity to say something, provided it is something amusing! There is no doubt about it, I do not begrudge her that, but our having to limit ourselves in political debate in such a way strikes me as positively catastrophic. I have just said that we are going to change the structures of the market. What we actually have in the European Union is not an internal market; rather, we have 15 submarkets which, in themselves, are more or less open, but which vary widely as to their degree of openness. That is still much more the case in the market for gas than in the market for electricity. If, though, we want to exploit the efficiency gains of an internal market, then what we need is not the addition of 15 submarkets, but an integrated, common, internal market. Efficiency gains to enable business – especially small and medium-sized enterprises – to improve its competitiveness, efficiency gains for consumers in terms of favourable prices, and efficiency gains for the environment, gained through the careful use of resources. The open market that we want is not a matter of ‘laissez-faire’ 
or of everyone doing as they please. We need rules for all the participants in this integrated market, rules that they can make sense of, rules that they can apply in a similar manner. We need, then, the access of all market participants to the networks and other system installations to be utterly transparent and free of discrimination, as otherwise distortions of competition will come into being. We therefore need a unitary regulatory framework, such as we do not as yet possess, the consequence of that being that we have a divided market and a system that in practice works virtually nowhere, with the possible exception of in one Member State in an island situation; it is not yet working anywhere else. We need a regulatory framework that sets objectives, lays down binding standards, and creates machinery and applicability across the board. Our problem is now that we have, of course, 15 different Member States, and the structures of these 15 Member States differ widely. The overall conditions of a country with 700 or more network operators are quite different from those of a Member State with only one network. What matters, though, is that the regulatory framework should have binding effect, with its application being monitored and with sanctions being imposed in the event of non-compliance. That is what is at stake, and, that being so, we must correct some of what the Commission originally proposed in its amending directive in order, on the one hand, that the objectives of the different systems in the Member States should be standardised, and, on the other, that their home-grown structures should remain compatible to some small degree. How the institutions and authorities in a Member State then guarantee that this happens 
is a matter for the Member State itself. All that is needed is for it to be clear and reliable for all participants in the market. So much for what we, as legislators, can actually regulate. I want to use the seconds remaining to me just to ask the Commission for something. It so happens that we currently have different conditions applying to electricity and gas respectively. On the whole, we produce electricity ourselves in the internal market. For gas, we are increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. I believe that, from the competition and competitiveness angle, we will have the important task of introducing competition among producers. I know this is a problematic issue, as the suppliers are generally from outside the EU, but this would be a task on which, as a whole, we would have to work together, as, without supply-side competition of this kind, we will never have more than restricted competition in the European market.

Madam President, Commissioner, today the world's eyes – or let us rather say, the eyes of Europe – were again upon you and what you were doing, although you were dealing with matters different from those which we are dealing with here tonight, which do not appear to be that interesting. However, I have just heard that I am permitted to speak for eight minutes, as my group is not especially interested in the subject. I see, though, that Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen are here, and so we can, anyway, give a repeat of our performance in committee, swapping our positions on this issue. But, joking aside … We have jointly – and ambitiously – resolved that the European Union is to become the world's most competitive region within the next ten years. If the European Union wants to be the world's most competitive region, that means that its enterprises must be the most competitive enterprises in the world. It also means that we need the European Union's ambience to be both favourable to competition and capable of handling it. Thus far, it is right that our task should be to roll back state aid to enterprises as far as possible, and our task must also be – if we actually have to grant aid at all – to direct it increasingly towards horizontal goals. To that extent, the perceptible decline in aid between 1997 and 1999 is to be welcomed – and that is the period under consideration, the period covered by the Commission's ninth aid report. We still, of course, call on the Commission to perform its role as a guard against aid that distorts competition. On the other hand, we should desist from seeing aid policy only through lenses coloured by ideology, and from engaging in it from one ideological standpoint or another. Some of us do that from time to time in this House, and I will give an example of it later. Whether we like it or not, it is a matter of fact that aid is a tool of state policy, because it is used for incentives to facilitate control in line with the market and because it can be used to avoid the need for intervention in the form of instructions or prohibitions. That cannot always be done. It is sometimes more appropriate to achieve something by means of legal regulations, but also sometimes just as practical to do it by means of control in line with the market. Aid has a vital place among the political instruments, as it can be used to correct failings in the market and reduce differences in standards of living between regions of the European Union. What we are doing with European regional and structural policy is, indeed, also aid, albeit not of the State variety that we want to discuss this evening, and those policies are political instruments in supporting SMEs, environmental protection, research and development. Let me say, Commissioner, that I welcome the fact that you, or the Commission, now have, in addition to the register of aid systems, which has now come into being, the State Aid Scoreboard. That was something called for by all groups in Parliament. This State Aid Scoreboard, which is in its earliest stages, can, in my view, be developed into an instrument which will make it possible to discern trends and assess aid by reference to qualitative criteria – the qualitative criteria to which I have just referred. That, then, is something I value. It is not only the quantity of state aid that should be comprehensively assessed; we also need qualitative criteria and objectives that have to be taken equally into account. As I have said, I have named them. Sometimes they justify control measures with time limits, and even existing market distortions can be removed in the medium term by the use of aid. I believe that the Commission has a far more broad and open mind – with apologies to Mr Evans, and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen – than has the present conservative-liberal majority in this House. I have noted that, in general debates, there is always full-bodied rejection of aid as if it were quite simply a snare of the devil. The politicians in the field, should one ask them, take quite different views of certain points. In reality, they too want nothing to do with its general disparagement. Let me now give you the example I mentioned earlier. The Commission has, fortunately, been investigating for some time the extent to which sleights-of-hand in the taxation of businesses are being used to obtain illicit aid. The Commission is doing this on its own initiative and because it is right to do so, but it is also doing it because it was called upon to do it. In committee, I formulated a passage in my draft report which the Commission, remarkably, emphatically supports, and along the lines of which it intends to go forward. When a vote was taken, the majority in committee cut out this passage. Now, I will be giving you the opportunity to make good this error tomorrow. My group will be reinserting this passage, and a couple of others as well, by means of an amendment. Do please remember that this is common policy on which we have agreed. So, tomorrow, you can make good the committee's error, or, alternatively, make it clear in public that that is not how you see the details of aid policy. You will have to do some thinking about that. I want to wind up by saying that too much praise for the Commission is not such a good thing. Let us cut back on it a little. So I would like to refer, Commissioner, to something I touched on once or twice in committee. It also has to do with the subject of qualitative criteria, qualitative and quantitative assessment. That is the area, as you will rightly observe, of regional aid granted by the Member States, which makes up a very large part of the aid total, well above half, I think about 56% or more if I remember rightly. You will conclude that that is the area in which a reduction in aid can be best and most rapidly achieved. That is, though, rather a generalised way of looking at things, and I would again recommend that you think a bit about whether it is not perhaps the area of regional aid in which we have very definitely to be guided by qualitative criteria. If we were to have a debate on that next year, that would represent some small progress.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me take a look at the economic and competitive aspects of public tendering from the point of view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Mr Zappalà has just referred to the fact that, according to the Commission's estimate at any rate, 14% to 15% of the EU's GDP is accounted for by building and supply contracts and contracts to provide services, all granted by the State or by enterprises whose function is to provide services for the general public. Looked at in terms of actual figures, 15% of the EU's GDP of about EUR 900 billion per annum amounts to EUR 125 to EUR 130 billion, not a small sum by any means. In this very area of public contracting, though, the internal market has not yet prevailed to any particular degree. There is a need for change to be brought about here. The award of contracts across frontiers is still the exception. Regulations are complex, muddled, rigid, cumbersome and bureaucratic, and the integration of social concerns and environmental issues into procurement practice has not yet been clarified either. Those, at any rate, are the challenges Parliament itself enumerated in its debates on the Green Paper and the communication from the Commission in 1996 and 1998. It is for that reason that we must now focus on the economic objectives and those related to competition policy. Our aim is also to help bring the Internal Market to fruition in this area. There is a need for clear, transparent rules that do not discriminate against anyone tendering for these contracts. On the other hand, though, there must also be the guarantee that nobody tendering for a contract can gain unjustifiable advantages for himself. It must therefore be made clear that standards must be adhered to as laid down by the law on labour, pricing and the environment. It is for that reason that Mr Zappalà is not quite correct when he argues in his final remarks that the economic aspects should be separated from the others. You cannot, of course, evade the other standards in order to gain an economic advantage. That is one of the ground rules that we all share, and it must also be obeyed.
Rapkay (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the consequences of the internal market is that many things that were regulated in a quite specific way in the Member States are now subject to new and different rules. Services of general interest are now an outstanding example of this, an example made more problematic by the additional factor that the objectives of services of general interest are similar in the Member States. The instruments, however, sometimes differ significantly as a consequence not only of different cultural developments, but also of the Member States' differing administrative structures. The drawing-up of shared rules is not exactly made easier by this. The Member States must, however, continue in future to be able to decide what services they will categorise as being of general interest. On the other hand, the rules must be as similar as possible in a common internal market. Competition law, as laid down in the Treaty, provides on its own insufficient legal certainty when it comes to framing them. On the other hand, the objective should not be to empty European competition law of its meaning. It must therefore be interpreted in a binding way for the purposes of services of public interest. We accordingly call for a framework directive to determine the Community principles on which services of general interest are to be founded. This directive should lay down rules for the Member States. Above all, though, it should provide legal security for those who provide services of general interest. Thirdly, it should limit the space available for the Commission to exercise its discretion. Its executive monopoly should not be infringed, but as far as its decisions in individual cases and its block exemption regulations are concerned, I would like to see it laid down what, for example, are 'economic activities' and what are not. What falls at this arbitrary threshold? When is intra-Community trade affected? Above all, the many sectoral directives and regulations on which we are working at present must give direction to the legislative work in various sectors done by those of us in the European Parliament… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first let me make an observation regarding my group. At the actual vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we did not have a very large majority. At least, the majority of my group voted against; and after all we did ensure that the report was not adopted during the last plenary part-session, but postponed until today. But let me say quite emphatically, that has nothing to do with the actual content of the report, but only with the fact which Mr von Wogau has just touched on, namely that we were worried that if we tied our hands in regard to the further procedure, Parliament would be renouncing its rights. Obviously we cannot accept that. In the committee itself, there was consensus on the issue as such. And the rapporteur really tried, made a real effort to bring about a consensus. We want a consensus on this question. And we would be well advised to reach a very broad consensus on it here in Parliament. The forthcoming changes to own funds rules for credit institutions and investment firms will have a far-reaching impact on the banking sector and beyond. These provisions very much influence the practices of credit institutions in granting loans. When we see how very heavily our European economy, and especially our small and medium-sized businesses, depend on loan financing, we soon realise that this is a very large-scale economic project. The very intensive debate on external rating made that abundantly clear. At international level, the proposal from the Basel committee to classify risks mainly on the basis of the results of ratings by external institutions would lead to considerable distortions of competition. It would create especially serious competitive disadvantages for medium-sized businesses. To prevent such distortions, it is therefore most important for the institutions to have a simple, alternative means at their disposal for identifying their own funds requirements, in fact one based on the use of internal ratings. It should be regarded as a success that the European position, as proposed from the outset by the Commission in its consultation paper, prevailed in Basel, so that the inclusion of internal rating procedures is now at the centre of the debate. Since as things stand at present, it seems that both the Basel Committee and we ourselves have accepted internal ratings in principle, our primary task now is to formulate these procedures in such a way that on principle all credit institutions within the European Union can introduce internal ratings across the board. That is the only way to create equal conditions of competition. However, that also means that these institutions must be given enough time to prepare for the new rules. The most recent information seems to suggest that the new regulation, first planned to enter into force on 1 January 2003, will be postponed until 2004. That would give the institutions more time to implement the provisions. So we simply have to ensure – and here I entirely agree with Mr von Wogau – that we work as closely in tandem as possible. In particular, we must ensure that there are no major differences between Basel and ourselves in relation to timescales. Otherwise the institutions concerned would just face unreasonable burdens, additional costs or competitive disadvantages. But one thing must also be made clear. Parliament cannot and will not give up its rights of codecision. So that means that if we manage to reach a decision at first reading, jointly with the Council and the moderation of the Commission, we will be happy to do so, but we will not give up our right to the codecision procedure from the outset. It is up to the Council. It is the Council that has always delayed legislative procedures in the past. It must get its act together and ensure that we can proceed rapidly. Parliament has never been responsible for the failure of such procedures. Nor would it be responsible for failure in this case. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, do get on with it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the lavish amount of speaking time we permit ourselves for debates of this kind, I want to dispense with the preliminaries and address Commissioner Monti directly. Commissioner, you know that for some time now, there has been a substantial consensus in this House on competition issues. This means that the entire House supports the Commission in matters of competition policy. With the passage of time though, I have begun to wonder whether the Commission is not, in fact, gradually losing its sense of perspective where individual decisions are concerned, or whether it even wants to prejudge fundamental decisions in entirely different political fields under the mantle of competition. I will cite one of several examples, and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other regions besides my own. It concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry. I will take the precaution, Commissioner – in case you should want to point out that this in fact falls within Commissioner Palacio’s remit – of saying that I am addressing the Commission as a whole. I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today. I expect the Commission to uphold its agreements. I do not expect it to abuse judgements from the Court of Justice in order to withdraw from these agreements. I will reiterate what I have already said repeatedly in debates of this kind: competition is not an end in itself. When a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy, account must be taken of the social, structural and industrial implications, and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology. If the aspects I mentioned are taken into consideration, and one considers the net product chain of the state-of-the-art technology, then the subsidy licences that have fallen due for coal mining must be granted without delay. This does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy; it applies right across the board. Competition is important but it is not the be-all and end-all. To sum up, what we need is to strike a balance between competition rules and acting for the public good. This must be the guiding principle in all areas. Commissioner, I want to take up what I said at the beginning. The support is still there. But if you carry on in this vein, you risk losing the support of not insignificant sections of the House. I dare say that is unlikely to help matters overall.

 Mr President, I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the Commissioner. I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of Parliament, and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter. I merely want to clarify that I spoke here on behalf of the second largest group, and expressed a real concern of ours, and if you heard Mr Caudron speak, then you would be aware that this is not something I alone am concerned about, because it is also something that bothers another MEP. And so I only spoke on behalf of my Group, and not for Parliament as a whole.
Rapkay (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to take up what Mary Read had to say in her intervention, when she discussed the impact on jobs and employment. It is simply not the case that the workers in our regions and constituencies are forever waiting with bated breath for us to liberalise previously protected sectors. The reverse is often true. We are going to have to answer a whole host of employees’ questions about local public transport operatives over the next few weeks and months. We, the representatives of the people, must provide these answers, and not the Commission, which will talk to the union leaders if need be. One thing is for sure, unrestricted liberalisation and the opening up of markets, are no panacea. However, market opening in the telecommunications sector itself, demonstrates that market opening can bring benefits for consumers in the form of falling prices and access to new services. It has brought about rapid advances in technology, which, at the end of the day, will lead to an increase in jobs, even high-quality jobs in the major sectors. The globalisation of our national economies has had a major stimulating effect on the liberalisation of telecommunications markets in Europe, and, conversely, has furthered development at international level. It goes without saying that we need a certain number of commercial giants to be able to hold our own as a global player. But this must not of course lead to new monopolies in markets and market sectors. We need to adopt a rigorous competition policy with regard to commercial organisations, in order to ensure that no single company gains a dominant hold in the new market block formed by the telecommunications and multimedia sectors. That is why we should support the Commission’s decision in matters such as WorldCom and Sprint. We also hope that it will adopt a similarly rigorous approach where Time Warner and AOL are concerned. Above all, though, the Commission must use its efforts to modernise competition law, particularly in respect of the regulation on merger control, as an opportunity to adopt an extremely rigorous approach to its reform undertakings too. We hope this will not prove to be to the detriment of competition policy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union’s competition policy. We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau’s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.  I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission’s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term “modernisation” to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression “retrograde step”. However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter. But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper. It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy. On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us. Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned. It should continue along this path. But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future – one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation. Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population’s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned. Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency. The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon. Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together. I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question. The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one’s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion? Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it. There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous. Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area. I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo. I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures. This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions. With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself. Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions. At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue. Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts. But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord. Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example. But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation. Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible. However, since state aid forms the lion’s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer’s report, to say one more thing about it. It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy. Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition. This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible. It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party.

 Mr President, this House has always demanded that economic, employment, social and finance policies should be coordinated and considered as a whole, in order to provide the European Union with a coherent strategy for growth, employment and society. We think it right that we should be doing as we now are and considering these broad economic policy guidelines not merely over a year, but over a longer period. That does not, however, mean that we do not have to take a very practical and critical look at these guidelines and at the need to adapt to changes in growth and employment. We can see very clearly that the European economy is continuing to lose its strength, and that, within the eurozone, recovery, where it has occurred or has had a beneficial influence on growth, is primarily attributable to a steep rise in exports, while domestic demand has sunk as a result of low levels of private consumption over several quarters. That must surely give us cause for concern, and so we want to consider and reformulate these broad economic policy guidelines in such a way as to stimulate economic growth and enable it to become more sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms. Only if all the Member States keep to what has been agreed will this be possible. I will now reiterate Parliament’s criticism to the effect that many Member States are not keeping to their commitment on the Lisbon strategy of combining and bundling all measures aimed at creating truly sustainable growth and also enhancing competitiveness. This is why I believe that the policy guidelines must be targeted even more than before at stimulating economic growth by way of investment and job creation, thus bringing about a rise in productivity. While the Growth Initiative, with this as its end, is surely to be welcomed, the guidelines should also express in clear and definite terms a concentration on human resources, research and development, and innovation, as well as on an industry policy that particularly prioritises small and medium-sized enterprises, renewable energies and environmentally-friendly technologies. Although the environmental technologies action plan must be implemented, we must not forget the need to invest in social infrastructure, for there will be no increase in productivity if we do not make work and family more compatible and thereby increase the number of women in work. This I do regard as a very important measure; it cannot be too much stressed that this is an area in which many Member States must make much more of an effort. Nor is the funding of growth-promoting investments any more adequate, and we should also be including in the broad economic policy guidelines coordinating measures to combat unfair tax competition and tax evasion. Indeed, the spending envisaged in the present Quick Start programme and in the Growth Initiative will take us no further than that, as all the economic research institutions are of course right to state that no investment under 1% of gross domestic product will have the desired effect, in particular, the positive effect hoped for on the vast mass of people in the European Union – over 14 million of them – who are unemployed. The broad economic policy guidelines must continue to focus on social and regional cohesion and on convergence in real terms, but there must be greater clarity as to which policy mix will actually prove successful, as we need strong synergy effects between, on the one hand, the necessary structural reforms and, on the other, investment and macro-economic policies aimed at stability and growth. This, of course, is where intelligent use of a more flexible Stability and Growth Pact is called for. Transparency and participative implementation of the Lisbon strategy are not just lofty ideals; these approaches really do promise a great deal in terms of using reform partnerships as a means of implementing the Lisbon strategy. It is my belief that such partnerships for change must concern themselves with economic, social and environmental issues across the board if the Lisbon strategy is to be improved and moulded into a more political form. Affirming, as I do, the spirit of Lisbon, I believe that this is the most comprehensive strategy for the purpose of mastering the problems of the European Union, but we must, of course, respond to economic change by updating these guidelines every year, which, as we can see, is becoming more and more necessary. Any reform of the structural funds must also take into account the importance of forging a link between the economic policy guidelines and the structural funds and the use made of them. Moreover, the whole must be formulated in such a way that all the partners really are compelled to make the connection in the interests of sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion.

Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs recommends the appointment of Mr José Manuel Gonzáles-Páramo as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. We have no doubts about his personal integrity and professional competence. In this context, however, we should like to point out that it would be a good thing if the European Central Bank were to sit down with this Parliament in future and reflect on the future role of the system of central banks. This is truly a vital requirement, not least with regard to the future selection of candidates. We also believe there is a need to examine whether it would not be appropriate to introduce a procedure whereby we ratify future appointments rather than merely deliver a consultative opinion.

 Mr President, on the way from the Chamber to a meeting of my group yesterday, I was pushed into a corner by a camera team, prevented from continuing on my way, and hurt my back in the process.

 Mr President, in one respect this Spring Summit has given us renewed hope. We can say: ‘Ropes away, full steam ahead with the good ship European Constitution
!’ I very much hope that it will be possible to find a satisfactory solution to the critical points that have already been mentioned by others here today. The fact is that we need this European Constitution in order to make it clear that Europe is not only a market, that we are not just an economic and currency union, and that not only do we have a single currency, but we also want to speak with one voice as a Community of values and rights. We must also speak with one voice in another area, in which the diversity of voices is much too great. The Lisbon strategy is not yet lost. We are still interested in sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion. However we are far from the objectives which we have set ourselves: the economic spring has not yet arrived, we have mass unemployment with more than 14 million people unemployed, and more than 55 million people are living on the edge of poverty, and, if we consider investments, we must really speak of an ‘investment moratorium’ in Europe. Internal demand has not been stimulated either; certainly it is not just because of the feeling of uncertainty as a result of globalisation, or the uncertainty as to how Europe will advance, but also because of the fears of terrorist attacks, that European consumers’ willingness to buy leaves much to be desired. We also lack the necessary stimulus actually to achieve production growth, which we can implement only through a higher purchasing rate, that is to say, through a reduction of unemployment, in the European Union. The European Union needs a new dynamism. Even if it were to be the case that tomorrow the European Central Bank, in view of the low inflation rates and the low growth of money supply, were to use its scope for manoeuvre and reduce interest rates, even that would not be sufficient. Further political measures are required. This does not mean speeches at summits, or agreements reached at them. It means implementation measures in the Member States. We will lose success and credibility if nothing is done about this! Mr President, Europe needs more projects like the Airbus, which has shown that public-private partnerships, different countries, different employees, different companies can work together. Why cannot Europe organise other successful projects with these values, which would really create hope, which would really create specific jobs, which would quite specifically promote the European lead in specific technologies of the future? For this, the investment drive, the Quickstart programme, is certainly a step in the right direction, but it is not sufficient; it is simply too little. We must continue to strive for reforms; we must dismantle barriers to trade and in particular services, but we must also concentrate on investment, and the Pact must not be an obstacle to this. The continued lack of a Community patent is also a deterrent factor for leaders in research and development. Although the Heads of State or Government have now seriously promised that it will come, it still cannot come this year! Only visible and specific results will convince the citizens of Europe of the advantages and added value of Europe. Europe is once again at the crossroads. Either we increase the rate of purchasing, muster optimism and dynamism and banish unemployment, or the credibility of the European unification process is in jeopardy.

 Mr President, please allow me, on behalf of the committee, to comment on a report which we have now unanimously accepted, because this has to do with an extension to the Lamfalussy procedure. What this means is that the legislative rights of the European Parliament will not be reduced without a provision in the European Constitution, so far only in Article 35 of the draft. What is at issue is that, if we delegate legislation to expert committees and the executive, we should at all times retain the right of review, so that, in the context of institutional balance, we are treated in exactly the same way as the Council. This has led to major problems on the issue of legislation on securities, but we have seen that this House has been able to remain in control of the legislative process, retain sovereignty of definition and draw a clear line between technical and political problems, so that the European Parliament, elected by the people, and therefore sovereign, has in fact also remained a co-legislator. What is now at issue is its extension to the banking and insurance sector. Here, the institutions, the legislative participants of the European Council and the Commission with their right of proposal, have given us an assurance that they will respect the rights of the European Parliament as a participant in the legislative process, and they are now also both issuing a declaration to that effect, so that no privileged treatment of the other legislator arises. We are prepared to adopt this procedure because legislation is becoming more and more complex, as will also be apparent in the area of telecommunications, but we cannot delegate sovereignty of definition and the political determination of legislation to experts or to the executive. Having received these guarantees from the Commission and the Council we will now proceed to vote on my report, which permits the expansion, but which at the same time makes it clear that the Parliament remains the legislator in the codecision process. That was not established with this degree of clarity prior to the Convention draft, but now we have here an agreement between the institutions, and I see this as a major step forward for this European Parliament.

 Mr President, ours is the enormous task of creating a new synthesis of the goals our society has set itself whilst at the same time remaining committed to the ideals that are characteristic of Europe and for which it is known. We have to create a new synthesis between work as a factor in social integration, equality of opportunity and the economic demands of competitiveness and job creation. What I have quoted from Jacques Delors’ 1993 White Paper is no less relevant today, and I believe that the failure to transpose this White Paper, despite the praise heaped upon it by all the Heads of State or Government and by this European Parliament, and despite the endorsement they gave it, demonstrates how important it is that the Lisbon process should no longer be allowed to stagnate, but that, instead, we should do everything possible – which, fortunately, the Irish Presidency of the Council is willing to do – to implement it at national and local level. I regret the failure to make progress in implementing it, and the primary reason why we should all share in that regret is that all the Member States are hiding behind the argument that there is that further progress is financially unsustainable. I believe that this excuse should no longer be considered appropriate, firstly because we now have the investment initiative – even though it is quite modest and will certainly not have the effects that the Marshall Plan, with even less money, did in reconstructing Europe – and, secondly, because we are giving no thought to how better coordination by the Member States can recover lost revenue, not only through the fight against organised crime and the black economy, but also – and primarily – by combating tax evasion. From VAT alone, it would be possible to raise an extra EUR 100 billion per annum, with which we would be able to manage to provide far more credible funding. I think it is also high time that we thought, when it comes to raising funds today, no longer only in terms of the European Investment Bank and its contributions to the organising of growth – valuable though they indeed are – but also to reconsider and examine the possibility of the European Union at last applying an instrument we debated as long ago as 1993, and inviting subscription to Eurobonds. Although this year’s Spring Summit must indeed create confidence – which is what we demanded that the Thessaloniki Spring Summit should do – it must also make it clear that we, in Europe, can be seen to add value by all pulling together. Vitally important though investments in the computer field and in information technology most certainly are, there are other areas in which we can invest: in the environment, in saving energy, in alternative energies, in order to generate sustainable growth accompanied by job creation, and – as has rightly been said – there is such a thing as investment in people, the European Union’s most valuable raw material, not only in early childhood but also in tertiary education and lifelong learning. One thing, though, I do not want to omit, and that is our need, alongside investment in people’s education and training, for investment in social services. To take one example, we will never be able to reconcile work and family life in Europe unless childcare provision is improved. This is where Europe, in most but not all of the Member States, has a lot of catching up to do. The World Commission on Sustainability and Globalisation too, backs up our demand in its report, published this week, and I think this shows us that what is needed today is no longer merely prescriptions of what is to be done, but the political willingness to join forces. No longer can Europe wait for growth in the United States; it must pull itself by its own bootstraps out of the swamp of mass unemployment, inadequate investment and inability to coordinate. I believe this to be a challenge for this Spring Summit, and I very much hope that it will succeed in persuading governments that the action they have taken to date will not be enough to prepare us for the future, which is vital to all of us and to generations yet to come.

 Mr President, on 18 November this Parliament rejected by a very large majority the Commission's proposal on excise duties on petrol and diesel. Pursuant to Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure, and after the Commission's refusal to withdraw its proposal, I am reporting back to you to say that on 2 December the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considered the matter again and reconfirmed its previous decision to reject the proposal. Representing the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, who is unable to be here today, I reiterate our belief that this harmonisation effort is not justified either from an environmental or from a competition point of view. We call upon the Commission to submit a new proposal and withdraw the current one in order to have a text more in sympathy with the recently adopted energy tax directive. An approach that eschews absolute harmonisation, for example with a rate band with an upper and lower limit, would be a more realistic option both in terms of chances of progress in the Council, and also in terms of allowing a degree of tax competition between Member States. There is also a need to coordinate taxation of fuels with infrastructure charges in order to guarantee a level playing field. For all these reasons, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs calls upon the plenary of the European Parliament to reconfirm its rejection of the Commission's proposal on excise duties on petrol and diesel.

 Mr President, as rapporteur, I am obliged to make a comment and recommend the rejection of the amendments other than those originating from the Committee of which I am Chairperson. I would, though, like to observe at the very outset that, whatever the different political groups to which we belong, we worked together very well on this, and this is particularly true in the case of Mrs Hermange – the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – and myself. Although it was no longer possible for that committee to put together an opinion and vote on it, we are voting the same way. I would furthermore like to make it clear that we disregarded group boundaries in voting together on one point on which the House has taken a political decision, namely the reduced rate of tax for labour-intensive services, and were outraged to hear Commissioner Bolkestein say yesterday evening that he envisages extending this for only six months, even though even the Council is thinking in terms of two years and we in terms of six. The Legal Service told the Committee that Amendment No 22, which is before us today, was not permissible, and the Committee voted it down for that reason. I fear, though, that Amendment No 22 could, today, politically speaking, send out the wrong message. The plenary can of course be wiser than a Committee, and so I recommend that it adopt Amendment No 22, thereby making a clear statement that we are extending the lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive services beyond 31 December 2003. In exactly the same way, by means of Amendment No 21, we can do the same for films.

 Madam President, today is not a day for delivering eulogies, nor is it a day when we should be saying that the law – European law – has been broken. The procedures are clearly described in the Maastricht Treaty, and they are echoed in the Stability Pact. Each has its part to play – the Commission just as much as the Council of Finance Ministers. The fact that they do not absolutely have to agree in their assessments has something to do with the way in which everyone stresses the need for the Pact to be adhered to and our need for rules, without it being clear how effective a pact of this kind can be when it deals only with sanctions for when things are going badly and makes no provision for the Commission to have a role when things are going well. The Pact is defective not only in that the Commission has no role when things are going well, but also in that it highlights only the difficulties that the Member States face in times of recession. Are not, though, the effects of a three-year period of stagnation, which has shaken and battered Europe’s major national economies in particular, ultimately every bit as bad as a recession? Today, I believe, we also have to emphasise that the Pact has, indeed, demonstrated its effectiveness and so we can set about reforming it without qualms. Any reform must involve the Commission abolishing its rigid procedures for cyclical adjustment and allowing itself to be judged using the methods chosen by the International Monetary Fund. If it did, perhaps our debates would be quite different, as we also have to bear in mind that the figures at issue between the Council of Finance Ministers and the Commission in the cases of France and Germany, even with the error rates in our statistics, relate only to a gap of 0.2%. What we really need now, I believe, is an in-depth debate on the reform of the Stability Pact; above all else, I believe that we have to combine a genuine definition not only of monetary stability but also of financial soundness, with growth and with social stability. That, rather than austerity alone, is the challenge that Europe faces.

 Mr President, in view of the Commissioner’s comments, I would ask the House’s Bureau to consider once again whether it might be more important to allow the rapporteur to speak first, since we are part of the legislative process and the Commission is merely making a proposal. I think this is a fundamental problem relating to parliamentary democracy, and one that we must address. As regards the matter at hand, I would like to begin with the last point. This House has lobbied in favour of a reduced rate of VAT for labour-intensive services. Regrettably, this was not adopted as mandatory by the Finance Council but was merely introduced as an option, and some Member States have put it into practice. However, it has been implemented very tentatively, so we have very little experience on which to assess the impact of this reduced rate of VAT on work and the black economy. That means that after two years, we did not even know whether this provision would be extended for a year, and we are aware that many companies were not prepared to take the risk and therefore did not participate in the experiment at all. So let me ask you this, Commissioner. If we take a simple service industry such as hairdressing, where we can see that there has been an increase in the number of employees and self-employed persons – thousands in Spain, and hundreds in Luxembourg and Belgium – should we not take this as a sign that what has been happening is something that we really must evaluate? Moreover, do you think it is right that after such a short time and based on such poor analyses by the Member States, you are nonetheless concluding that the reduced rates of VAT really have had no impact on employment, especially given that in some sectors, the figures tell a very different story from the ones in your reports? That is why I urge you to extend this provision – if not for ten years, then for six years, not six months – for otherwise, there will be no legal certainty for the companies involved and we will also be unable to determine whether there has been any change in behaviour on the part of the clients and the businesspeople themselves. Let me turn now to the fundamental principle underlying your proposal. I am very sympathetic to the idea of a systematic approach to reduced rates of VAT, but I must ask you this, Commissioner: the whole point is to move towards a definitive VAT system based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin, so that we can introduce this and finally establish genuine and systematic clarity. We still have a long way to go before we reach that point. Indeed, we really cannot see how any progress on the issue of VAT is to be achieved at all. Therefore as one of the MEPs concerned, the question in my mind is this, and I put it to you on behalf of my committee and on behalf of this plenary as well: Do we need rules in areas where competition is not distorted and where the functioning of the internal market is not affected? You have mentioned children’s clothing and children’s shoes, but you yourself are listing children’s car seats for a reduced rate of VAT. I really do not understand the argument any longer, Commissioner. I also think it is very important to make it clear that in the European Union, it must be permissible to promote culture using different instruments and approaches. If some Member States choose to go down the tax rate route and others prefer direct subsidies, we must be saying to ourselves that this House is committed to the principle of subsidiarity, and only to the Community principle where there are actual distortions of competition. I cannot see that in the areas identified in our report, the functioning of the internal market is in any way impeded, and I also cannot see that consumers are being invited to cross borders in order to purchase products or services or distort the market. That really is not the case. That is why I believe that we are not yet at the stage of being able to implement your ideas. I ask you, too, to show understanding for citizens who want to treat the internal market as their home market. I therefore take the view that tax legislation must take account of these citizens’ interests. I think our report offers a promising approach for compromises that serve the interests of a well-functioning EU home market.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have not provided an adequate explanation of why you are submitting this proposal at the present time. Nor have you provided an adequate explanation of why you are unwilling to allow this experiment with reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services to continue, even though you must realise that the analysis of the findings is inaccurate, given that the Member States’ reports are so general that they did not stand up to scientific scrutiny. The Commission is obliged to supply Parliament with a well-founded opinion, not just a general opinion containing snippets of information simply hinting that no tangible impact on reducing ‘black’ work can be identified. Commissioner, there are economic research institutes which can undertake this study on your behalf. There are social science institutes that can do so too. This Parliament – and, indeed, you yourself – must have a sound basis for a decision, and you are well aware that a six-month period is really not long enough to carry out studies of any kind. With this in mind, I urge you to set this experiment, which no one has taken seriously, on a serious footing at last and let it run for the next six years.

 Mr President, the draft constitution rightly contains the constitutionalisation of the Lisbon process, and it really was an achievement for this European Parliament to try and give the European Union a profile that combines economic reform, growth, full employment and social cohesion, and the draft treaty’s underlying values are also evidence of this objective. Regrettably, however, the instruments for achieving these objectives of the European Union are extremely weak. Coordination is mentioned, and rightly so, but precisely because ours is not only a monetary union but also an economic union and a political union, we have given far too little thought to the need to keep in mind not only the interdependence of national economies, but also the social circumstances of our citizens. I very much regret that we find very little in all these areas about how political decisions are to be given democratic legitimacy or that treats this as a priority. That itself is something of a failing in the Convention treaty. But when I hear that the finance ministers are calling on the Intergovernmental Conference to do even less than is contained in the draft, then that is a retrograde step that we in this House cannot allow. And there is something else we must not allow. As the European Parliament, we are quite willing to grant that Parliament does not need to have a say in every technological innovation in areas covered by the codecision procedure, and we are prepared to allow secondary legislation, but only on condition that in this Union committees of experts are not able to cover up and change everything behind closed doors, and for that reason the whole of Article 35 must also be included in the constitutional treaty as it comes out of the Intergovernmental Conference. That is also part of the democratisation of economic and monetary policy.
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is only right that the Convention’s draft should come to the conclusion that we have too little Europe rather than too much. That is why we need coordination not only of economic and financial policy, but also of social and employment policy as well. I believe that the initiative for growth and investment, which we are discussing, makes clear how feeble are our conceptions of how growth and employment are to be organised. That is why I would like to call on the Council and its President to speak in far more definite terms about the approaches we want to take. It is, I think, a good thing that we are going back to the infrastructure modernisation measures and thinking about energy and the environment rather than just transport. I think it right that we should give some thought to research and development, but we must, above all, get a skills offensive started in all Member States simultaneously, as we will not be able to increase growth without skilled people, nor will we be able to become a knowledge-based society in which everyone is able to participate. That is why everything possible has to be done to give us functioning social services, which should, in particular, help to reconcile work and family life, for women are indispensable if we are to achieve the higher employment rate that we need. Sweden, Denmark and Finland have shown the ways in which we can do this. The European Union has no lack of sources of funds, and I am not thinking only of the EIB or of the other options available. I cannot but consider the way in which, in this European Union, payment of VAT is evaded to the tune of an estimated EUR 100 billion a year, quite apart from other taxes. That would be more than these EUR 220 billion for ten years, and would enable us to get something really up and running. That is why it really is time for us not to do as your own country does and put our faith in tax amnesties, but to at last get round to coordinating mutual assistance by tax authorities as a means of dealing with the scandalous cross-border criminal activity involving fraudulent invoicing, the motor and mobile phone trades, and the use of VAT evasion as a means of funding other underhand activities; all of these things we must put the brakes on, halt them and put an end to them once and for all.

 Mr President, although the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sees the extension of the codecision procedure as being, in principle, much to be welcomed, we do not believe that this goes far enough, as it leaves out policy areas that are crucial to the functioning of the internal market and of the economic and monetary union. It is particularly to be regretted that the simplification of procedures even diminishes the status of joint consultation, as the cooperation procedures have been made merely consultative. We are therefore, of course, less than satisfied, particularly in the areas of competition policy or fiscal policy, which are of immediate relevance to the internal market. I would also like to point out, though, that we would have liked to see the appointment of a Minister for Economic Affairs, which would, in particular, have enabled us – especially in the euro zone – to make a qualitative leap in terms of how we implement the Lisbon objectives. I also think it regrettable that we have not been able to get the Lisbon process constitutionalised, which means that this new Constitutional Treaty cannot be described as a real European economic constitution. I would, however, like to welcome the way in which the EU’s values and objectives are seen as conditional upon sustainable growth, full employment, solidarity and the social market economy, competition and freedom.

 Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I recommend that Parliament confirm the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as the appropriate candidate for the office of President of the European Central Bank. The nominee has submitted a written statement and has given oral explanations to the committee in the course of a confirmation process. He has convinced the members of the committee not only of his personal integrity and professional competence, but also of his views on economic and monetary policy in the Eurozone. At the same time, he has shown that he is receptive to the demand for more transparency and democratic accountability for the European Central Bank. Five years after its foundation, the European Central Bank has come of age. Its independence – in political, economic, financial, organisational and staffing terms – is guaranteed and is not challenged by the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. Its high measure of independence, which exceeds that of America’s Federal Reserve, means that the ECB has a high measure of responsibility for macroeconomic and social development. This requires the greatest possible transparency in the interests of democracy and integration policy. For this reason, the transparency of decisions and the decision-making procedure is integral to the European Central Bank’s role. This effort to achieve transparency is reflected in the quarterly monetary dialogue with the European Parliament, in the regular publications and decisions, but also in reports, conferences and the inflation forecasts that are published every six months. A kind of cultural revolution has thus taken place in Europe. The culture of the national central banks in Europe did not have this kind of transparency. Incidentally, transparency is also in the ECB’s interests because it is still a new institution, and is thus especially reliant on establishing and consolidating its legitimacy, credibility and trustworthiness as a European authority. Ultimately, a nation’s monetary system reflects all that the nation stands for and all that it aspires to and endures, to quote Europe’s leading economist Josef Schumpeter. I believe that at the current stage of the debate, incorporating the Maastricht Treaty in its entirety into the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was the right step. Over their centuries of existence, the role of the central banks has undergone radical change, starting with their private form of organisation in history to their changing status in the USA, the concept of combating inflation, and the role of an independent issuing bank. It may be too early to find answers to new challenges today. The task is to define the role of the Central Bank in a globalised world dominated by trade, commerce and international financial markets. That means not only dynamic markets, but also more and higher risks to international financial stability. What role, then, can and should central banks play in order to contribute to financial stability, to avoid financial crises and to provide assistance? Is the ECB equipped for a role as a lender of last resort? Is this what we want? The euro has enhanced Europe’s international status as well. The ECB will have to play an ever greater role in defining and implementing appropriate policies for the global economy. We are concerned about the dramatic imbalance in the US economy and the risks that may arise for every other part of the world in the mid to long term as a result. Many issues relating to the ECB’s future policy are tied in with the appointment of its new President. They include the definition of price stability as much as the issue of monetary policy instruments. Maintaining price stability as the primary goal must not result in the ECB removing support for growth and employment from its list of tasks. Monetary policy is not neutral, so the ECB must play a role, as a macroeconomic actor, in coordinating European policies. This is where willingness to engage in ex-post coordination is not enough. Decisions will have to be taken on this issue, and fresh impetus must come from the new President. The European Parliament expects other measures towards greater transparency as well, from the publication of summary reports of decisions, with arguments for and against the decisions adopted, to the (anonymous) results of voting in the ECB Governing Council. What is important is an open and transparent monetary policy in which access to the decision-making process is a given, because this is in all our interests and in the interest of the common good. The future President is able to build on the successful work undertaken by the first ECB President, Wim Duisenberg. The Members of the European Parliament are confident that he will face up to the new challenges and be able to find the right solutions. (Applause)

 Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, and I share his disappointment on the minimum solution. Commissioner Bolkestein also made it very clear that this minimum solution is a small breakthrough, but that the European Union has not actually succeeded in a consistent approach to energy taxation. This consistent approach remains coherent though, and after the experience with fiscal coordination we can almost be grateful because once again we had to experience how much the unanimity rule in fiscal decision-making hampers the functioning of the internal market. It is extremely regrettable that the fourth Environment Action Programme, which envisaged that sustainable development and economy could be stimulated not only by environmental regulation but also by tax regulation, could not be implemented, and so this directive’s tale of woe goes further back than just 1999. Furthermore, the directive also has the defects – as has already been said – of low minimum rates, non-indexation of minimum rates and also the difficulty of derogations. We have already debated the issue of derogations on several occasions in this House. I believe that we have actually always agreed that there have to be derogations for energy intensive enterprises, but that these derogations should at least incorporate conditions enabling the situation to be tackled. This has not happened, and so this directive is bound soon to be followed by another. What is positive is that this directive is not only a framework for the taxation of all types of energy, including electricity, but that at the same time it also supports the promotion of renewable sources of energy and thereby will surely be able to give additional impetus to further develop these renewable sources of energy. That is a good thing, because we know that it is renewable energy that gives not only Europe, but also world civilisation, a chance, since we all profit from the tax incentives for using environmentally friendly forms of energy. Actual primary energy generally costs nothing, and furthermore it can be obtained and converted where energy consumption takes place. Thus the steering effect of tax incentives for energy use is an important addition to the EU Environmental policy and, I believe, also to emissions trading. Rather than seeing this as a contradiction, here too, I see it as adding to the instruments that steer our European economies and lives towards sustainable development. It is also to be welcomed that this directive will make possible the final implementation of measures for preferential tax treatment for biofuels, on which we have already agreed, but the regulation of which was, of course, coupled to general taxation. I can also see that the goals that we set can be achieved. I would just like to emphasise once again that in the past many Member States have taken advantage of the revenue effect of environmental taxes, in particular, energy taxes. I welcome the fact that in the meantime we can at least have the possibility of reaching a European agreement.

Mr President, the negotiations on the directive on investment services and regulated markets have once again shown how difficult it is to bring together the different European market philosophies and traditions, in particular the continental model of stock exchanges, which have in the meantime lost their public-private character to a large extent and have been privatised, and the investment banks’ new internal trading systems. To allow these two systems to coexist at European level and to organise fair competition as well as protecting the interests of investors at the same time is a difficult task, and that will become particularly clear when we see what high sums are transferred every day and what effects the development of the financial markets will have on European and world economies. That being so, I hope that the compromise, which was reached through very tough negotiations in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will encourage the Council to come to similar compromises so that this important legislative act on implementing an integrated financial services market can actually be passed in this term. I believe that we have tried to consider the interests of all market participants, including non-professional investors, and that we have implemented the principle of transparency in all key areas, just as the Commission intended. For example, in the interests of price transparency and investor protection, it is necessary that contracts limited to internal trading systems, if they cannot be carried out by the internaliser directly, can be directly transferred to the regulated markets, unless the customer explicitly rules this out. A quick transfer offers the best chances for the best possible completion of the contract in the interests of the customers. I thereby believe that we have reached the right decision in this House, as is the case for the disclosure requirements in Article 25. I hope that with this directive competition of all trading systems will have a chance without the protection of investor interests being neglected.

Mr President. The rapporteur quite rightly stated in his report that the changes made in past years have all been in the right direction. Our committee has clearly said, as I would also like to do, that Basel II is right to aim to make banks more stable, and that aim of Basel II is a very laudable one in view of what we know about the costs associated with bank crises. The fact is that risk sensitive loan pricing is a key requirement for a stable financial system. Basel II still needs to be discussed. The debate has already lasted more than four years and I must say that it is positive that, in particular under the first pillar, the risk weighting function has been lowered and made significantly shallower. This avoids possible problems relating to access to credit, above all for SMEs. Furthermore, it is also positive that the appeal of shorter loan periods has lessened. From a European perspective, it is also certainly important that there should be no discrimination against tangible collateral. It must be dealt with in the same way as financial collateral. We should, however, finally realise, that Basel II will have an impact, not only on small and medium-sized banks, but also on SMEs. The extremely varied funding framework in the EU, which is nonetheless indispensable for business, must be kept. An increase in capital demands for loans secured by the economy’s promotional bodies and self-help institutions that are not covered by risk considerations must be excluded. A few further questions: I believe that it should be justified why only ten banks in the USA have to use Basel II and a further ten institutions use Basel II on a voluntary basis, whilst in Europe all credit institutions must implement the models. It is quite right that small European banks are not in direct competition with US institutions excluded from the Basel obligations, but instead with these institutions’ corporate customers. This could potentially mean that, in terms of competition, European businesses would be put at a disadvantage on the world market. I think that this needs to be clarified and I also count on the opinion sought by the Commission discussing this point, and in sufficient time for it to give rise to some amendments. I would also like to emphasise that it is very important that the crucial points that have been brought up by Charles Goodhart’s research group from the London School of Economics should also be clarified, in particular those referring to the procyclicality of Basel II, to which reference has already been made. I would like to formally give my support to Mr Radwan in his reasoning that Parliament should tackle in good time the problems of SMEs and their employees, that we should continue to do so, and that above all we should also ensure that Parliament’s voice continues to carry weight and will be heard at the end.

 Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, the annual debate in this House on the Annual Report of the European Central Bank, just like the quarterly Monetary Dialogue, always provides us with an opportunity not only to take stock but also to examine the outlook. Against this background it is therefore especially pleasing to note that no one disputes the successes achieved in establishing the issuing bank, introducing the notes and coins, and also in combating inflation. I would also like to thank you very sincerely for your cooperation and for the contribution you have made. The fact that 75% of Europe's citizens are now in favour of the euro must certainly be due in part to your work and your actions. We will of course do everything we can to win over the remaining 25%, and we hope that the three Member States still outside the euro area will soon be part of European monetary union. (Applause)
 Although interest rate levels are at an historically low level in Europe, I find myself wondering, when I consider the European Central Bank's monetary policy, about the appropriateness of those rates, given our failure to achieve our growth potential and the price stability guaranteed for the foreseeable future. That is why I ask myself if our monetary policy strategy is the optimum one. The bank itself has of course investigated to what extent it can be satisfied with its own monetary policy strategy, and I do indeed see that as being very helpful. However, we as politicians also need to consider at all times whether this monetary policy strategy is optimal not only in terms of monetary policy, but also as regards those aspects of macroeconomic policy that relate to the Lisbon objectives – growth, employment and social cohesion. I know that does not make your job particularly easy, because there is also room for improvement in the coordination of economic, employment and finance policies. Nevertheless, I wonder what scope there is for making a further contribution. The definition of price stability now agreed upon, with a medium-term inflation rate target of under 2%, if only just, will help here. But I still believe that our bank of issue has a more rigid definition of price stability than other internationally important central banks. That is why we need constantly to reflect upon whether a certain change of course would not be appropriate. I also believe that it is important for us consistently to consider inflation, deflation and how they are defined, especially in view of the risk of deflation. Even during times of strong economic growth a symmetrical target of 2% with a range of plus or minus 1% should certainly be considered. The ECB must not underestimate the importance of a strategy for low growth and increased employment in the euro area. Although this is, of course the secondary rather than the primary objective, we still do not as yet have a clear definition. It is apparent in the current economic situation that incentives for growth are urgently needed and I wish to specifically welcome new investment initiatives and also the support of the European Investment Bank. I view this initiative very much in the context of structural and fiscal reforms, but such reforms alone will not enable us to achieve the Lisbon objectives. That is why I believe this to be so important. You will not be surprised if I refer once again to transparency of monetary policy, because this House has made its views on this very clear over the years. I still cannot see how it would jeopardise the effectiveness of the bank if summary minutes were to be published. Nor do I see how it would put the ECB or its independence at risk if the result of weighted votes were to be published without naming names. To my way of thinking, it would result in greater clarity, more information and it would avoid false reporting. I have in mind your last press conference and the way it was reported in the British press, which led to much speculation and aggravation on the markets. We could do something to change that. Greater transparency prevents inaccurate assessments, which in turn lead to bad investments – something we all wish to avoid. That is why I think it is important to do still more in this area. There is also scope for gaining greater public acceptance for the euro, for example by abolishing the 500-euro note or by printing a 1-euro note. After all, there is a 1-dollar note! (Applause)

 Mr President, there is no doubt that the European Passport for issues of securities will, in future, make it easier to raise capital. This proposal is one of our contributions to the removal of bureaucracy and of the other barriers that mean that a financial internal market is still not yet feasible. I have to say that there has been very constructive cooperation between the institutions, and this has been made easier by the rapporteur’s willingness to compromise; we have all had to agree on formulations in order to produce a watertight piece of legislation. I think it was a great stroke of genius for us to draw a distinction between equity and non-equity securities. That was a smart move, for which I am sure that, one day, both investors and issuers will be grateful to us. When we do actually adopt a directive, it will be important for us always to attempt to balance the interests of the issuers and those of investors. In this directive, this House has again attached great value to the protection of small investors, who have in recent years been particularly unsettled, and we are obliged to restore small investors’ confidence if we really do want to have a properly-functioning internal financial market from which everyone can benefit. The three things that are important are, firstly, that every investor will in future be able to rely on the prospectus underlying an issue complying with high standards of quality, without regard to the issuer’s home country and also without reference to the country in which the security is offered. This will become a selling point. The second is that, in the course of negotiations, we were able to make it a requirement that the summary prospectus, which is the main source of information for small investors, should comply with high standards and form part of the prospectus. If the summary is false, misleading or inconsistent, it must be possible, in consequence of this, for those responsible to be brought to account. Thirdly, the investor is protected against misleading advertising, in that it is ensured that issuers, when describing their product in the media, cannot promise more than the security can hold in accordance with the prospectus. In conclusion, I would like to mention one concern that again became very apparent when this directive was under discussion, and that is the question of whether Parliament’s rights have actually been safeguarded. If I consider the Interinstitutional Agreement in the light of better regulation, I have my doubts about this, so you can be sure that we will consider very carefully whether the work that you and CESAR do on this particular directive meets our expectations and is within the framework we have set. If you were to fully meet Parliament’s expectations, that would build confidence in the legislation to be derived from this in future, and in secondary legislation.

Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur: the proposal submitted for reform of the voting in the ECB Governing Council is not a step in the right direction. It is because it was developed from the perspective of national representation, not a European perspective, that it must be rejected. What we actually need is an ambitious European solution. Here, no Member of this House can be neutral, for the way in which such a key macroeconomic partner arrives at its decisions is important. We must therefore know how the decisions are shaped, but there is still time for that at the next Intergovernmental Conference. Specifying that representation should be on a national basis conflicts with the aim of an integrated monetary policy. However, I should point out here that when drafting its proposal, the European Central Bank's hands were tied, for the paltry spirit of the Treaty of Nice is also reflected in the enabling clause contained in Article 10.2, and we therefore do indeed need a proposal from the Convention for the Intergovernmental Conference so that a number of issues become clear: should the Executive Board have a special role? Should we differentiate between monetary policy and operational decisions? Where should the strategic decisions be taken? This is possible with a unanimous amendment to the Treaty. I really do think it is important for us to make this distinction, simply because it is necessary. As the European Parliament, we also have a particular interest in doing so because we attach importance to transparency. Like our colleagues in the USA, we want to be able to follow how decisions are taken and also how weightings occur in the discussions. In this respect, the difficult proposal by the ECB, which we in the Socialist Group cannot endorse, sends out quite a hopeful signal – for up to now, we have always been told that the outcomes of the votes in the ECB's Governing Council could not be published because no votes take place. I think that in a democratic system, majority voting should apply, and then the voting behaviour of the individual members of the central banks or the Executive Board can also be published. I am all in favour of anonymity, so that no names are mentioned, as in the USA. Our key concern is to gain an overview of the various perspectives on monetary policy. This will remove confusion and insecurity, create the clarity that is required, especially at present, and underline the Central Bank's democratic duty of accountability.

 Mr President, proactive and resolute leadership is needed on economic policy at the EU's spring summit. We cannot go on trotting out the same old formulae. Unfortunately they fall far short of what is required at a difficult time, which is not only characterised by an economic downturn but also, regrettably, by the shadows that an approaching war is casting over economic and employment policy. That is why Parliament's reports – and I mean all of those on the table this evening – show a glimmer of hope but at the same time make demands that mercilessly expose the weaknesses in the European economy. I should like to underline that it is out of the question to eliminate a Stability and Growth Pact that has been created to bring order to the economy. Instead we need to apply it taking into account the Lisbon objectives in a time and a place and in such a way that it makes sense, because the people of Europe deserve no less. I think that we need to make every effort to halt the economic slide. We cannot deny either that even the European Central Bank is now talking about risks of a downward trend in the European Union. This means that we need to pursue a proactive policy and to that extent the repeated references to structural reforms do not serve any purpose either. Besides, we do not yet know what economic benefits these structural reforms will bring to the European Union and we have no idea what impact they will have on employment policy. Economic institutes, national ministries and also the Commission have not answered this question. But we need this answer to know which direction is the right one. I believe that the saying still holds true: employment creates growth, but growth also creates employment. We have to work on the basis of real growth and not only on the basis of potential for growth. I should like to point out once more that it is absolutely right – as the reports also state – for us to refer repeatedly to the lack of investment in both the private and public sectors. We are not honouring the Lisbon agreement about 3% growth. Neither are we respecting the agreement to invest more in research and development, and that too applies to both the private and public sectors. Japan and the USA are streets ahead of us in both respects. At the moment we perhaps do not really need an economic government, but coordination up and across our governments, coordination that is worthy of the name, is in the interests of growth and employment.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, what makes the forthcoming Spring Summit so crucial in terms of political psychology is the fact that the times in which we live are not at all rosy. The message from this summit must be one of confidence, because Europe's economy and hence growth and employment, will not be got moving if such confidence in the EU Member States' political leadership is not created or, where it exists, improved. I do think, however, that it is not just confidence in governments that matters, but that it is also significant that European business is at last affirming its responsibility for contributing towards growth, investment, and employment. The state alone cannot create the jobs that Europe needs in order to really develop its productivity and also in order to become the region of the world best able to face the future. So it is to the Greek Presidency of the Council that I am appealing for a continued campaign against unfair fiscal competition and for us to be enabled at last to blockade all the tax havens and not let matters rest with the first breakthrough we achieve on the fiscal package, so that everyone can help put the Member States in a better position as regards the receipts on which their ability to make investments depends. It is at this point that I would like, again, to appeal to the private business sector to step up private investment. Not only is there too little public investment, but the private sector also invests too little, and it is only partnership between the two that will enable Europe to evade the self-fulfilling prophecy that our weak growth – or, in certain states, stagflation – will be followed by recession, which is something Europe can do without. It is because our periods of growth are far too weak that this appeal is addressed to the Greek Presidency of the Council, along with the appeal to the Commission and the Council for improved cooperation between the institutions. The European Parliament, as co-legislator, is prompt in doing its work, and it would be a good thing if the Council could keep up with us. (Applause)

 Mr President, the EBRD is funded by the taxpayer, which is why transparency must be established in respect of its activities. As the European Parliament, we attempted this from the outset during the Bank's start-up phase, and I must say it has not always been a success story; the Bank has also been through some very difficult times. Even in Parliament, opinions were divided as to whether we should indeed still have our own bank. This too must play a part in today's debate. Mr Lemierre, you have described the Bank's task as being a ‘classical’ general interest service which, however, makes use of private-sector intervention instruments. This is undoubtedly an apt description and we must test its activities to determine to what extent this is actually being realised. You are undoubtedly in a difficult position because the development of the private sector, as an outcome of successful transformation processes in the states where you operate, fails above all because there is no fully functioning financial sector, which means that the financial conditions for business start-ups and operations are very difficult. For this reason, I welcome the fact that you have concentrated 30% of your resources on this sector. I also recognise that your activities in the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses are important to a functioning market economy and to the development of democracy. However, what is also important is to see how stability can be achieved in these countries. How can we facilitate economic growth through investment? That is an issue which constantly occupies our minds in the European Union as well. In my view, it is especially important that you can take risks which others cannot take, and that this willingness to take risks does not conflict with sound and reliable management. This is reflected in the high rating the Bank has received from rating agencies. The Bank is unique among multilateral development banks in having a political mandate. Its task is to contribute to a social market economy, democracy, pluralism and the rule of law. In this context, you should focus even more strongly on ensuring respect for human rights and democratic principles. You should deny support, to an even greater extent than before, to states and companies which engage in unfair practices and in which there is corruption and mismanagement. This should also apply to failure to comply with the objectives of environmentally sound, socially compatible and sustainable development. The EBRD is still operational in Central and Eastern Europe. These states' accession to the EU will open up many investment opportunities, which will not be available to other states. For this reason, it is worth considering whether the current division of responsibilities between the EBRD, the EIB and the World Bank should be reviewed, including in geographical terms, despite their clear mandates, for the future success of the transformations in the former CIS republics will contribute not only to economic and political stability in these countries, but will also have an impact on the European Union and other regions of the world. The transformation processes in all countries require further joint efforts and financial support, and this includes the accession countries as well. However, it is the most underdeveloped countries that pose the greatest risk of instability. In my view, Mr President, this is a fresh challenge for the EBRD!

 Mr President, I wish to state my view that Mr Bourlanges's astute reflections are only likely to put an end to the procedural chaos if we really are prepared to be guided by this transparency and clarity in the hierarchy of acts, and that is not always very easy, particularly for those of us who deal with lawmaking in this Parliament's specialised committees, as there is the temptation in modern-day laws to draw a distinction between technical issues and questions of policy. And, as lawmaking has become not only a more involved process but also ever more complex, Members of this House are assumed to be incapable of mastering difficult technical problems. So the executive, wanting to be helpful, puts its rules in appendices or other forms of act, despite the fact that in some cases there are some really intricate political issues of decisive importance lurking in their depths. I think this makes it right and proper to propose that a hierarchy of acts be used to create reliable forms of cooperation. Alongside primary legislation, we need secondary legislation; it is only when it comes to secondary legislation that we need, even more than the national parliaments – which already have it these days – the so-called callback procedure, as this House has no right of initiative with which to reverse the Commission's initiatives. I think it is to the committee's enormous credit that it has now also concurred with the view that both institutions, which are held in an institutional balance, must each have their own chance to withdraw a proposal. I think that really is of the utmost interest for democratic and transparent lawmaking.

Madam President, the Commission communication actually takes up a proposal which Parliament has debated time and again in this Chamber since the second stage of monetary union, namely the need to try and coordinate and interlink the various political areas much more closely. We have always taken the view that this will only work once all the political areas have been put on an equal footing and all the Councils are considered equal under a guiding General Council. Unfortunately it took the Lisbon process, some six years later, to grab this opportunity and I am delighted that we have now moved from theory into practice. Commissioner, we have great expectations of the Commission; we expect an agreement to be reached. Europe is sorely in need of one. And that applies not just to economic and employment policy; it also applies to social and environmental policy. Europe is sorely in need of one because we cannot afford the luxury of uncoordinated policies. The Delors Commission concluded at one point that uncoordinated policies were costing us growth, which automatically means they are costing us jobs in the European Union. We are counting on an end to this situation and from that point of view this new paper really is most welcome. But it is only most welcome if it can rely on a more secure data situation than is presently the case and we can explain to our citizens that the coordination process is not just yet another euro-word or instrument which will not stand up in practice. What do I mean by that? We need to be able to show that certain economic or employment or environmental policy decisions in one Member State also harm or benefit the national economy or the job market or the environment in another Member State and can halt, freeze or foster growth, and we need statistics that can provide us with the relevant data. Unfortunately, to the disappointment of European economic researchers, this is still not the case. What we need is a coordination profile and this profile may become clear in the question of how we bundle investments, investments in research and development for example, where Europe unfortunately still has a great deal of catching up to do. The main thing is that Parliament should be involved under an interinstitutional agreement, at the very latest by the time the Convention completes its reforms and the Treaty is amended.

 Mr President, European competition policy is one of the European Union's central policy instruments and that is why I would very much welcome it if the Commission were to stand alongside Parliament and also include this sector in the codecision procedure. I really do think it is important for us to make competition policy more democratic and invest it with greater legitimacy than it has had so far, because after all the decisions that the European Union makes on the internal market, the market economy and competition are justified by the fact that competition has a distributive function and is therefore said to contribute to fair income distribution, increase social welfare and act as a mechanism to ensure that the factors of production are efficiently allocated. This should improve supply to the benefit of producers and consumers and finally it should also act as an incentive to promote technical progress and maximise the national product. Obviously we all consider market power and processes of concentration to be damaging. These considerations should also play a role in our debate about a constitution and in the revision of the treaties, and I very much hope that they will also be even more visible in the application and reform of competition law. Finally, this policy must also be brought into line with the Lisbon process and its objectives. That is why the annual report is certainly a successful report and it is also positive that for the first time it addresses the issues surrounding services of general interest. Unlike Mr Langen, I expect the Green Paper to provide not only a thorough analysis of how to handle the provision of public services of general interest, but also a decision on a starting point for future legislation. In this context, I welcome the fact that you wish to put the public service guarantee on the same footing as the principle of free competition. I hope that the Commission will produce a proposal for a framework regulation or framework directive as quickly as possible and that it will take account of national specificities and traditions and in particular leave it up to the Member States to define public services. Commissioner, you were right to say how important it is to control cartels and mergers. I should like to stress once more here that there is certainly a need to analyse the individual parts of the latest court rulings in precise detail and to draw conclusions from them. But these court rulings do not in any way dent Parliament's confidence in the Commission's competence, which has been amply proven over the years. Commissioner, I should like to ask you to take greater account of workers' rights in your merger control work ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, I would just like to stress that the European Parliament supports the Commission proposal to make the most of this experiment in reducing rates of VAT for labour-intensive services. Nevertheless, we are very disappointed that the nine Member States that have taken advantage of this did not see their way to submitting their reports on this experiment as agreed, so that the Commission does not have a basis for preparing its own legislative proposal. I wish specifically to appeal to these Member States to submit their reports next year so that we can have a European legislative proposal on reducing rates of VAT for labour-intensive services by the end of this parliamentary term.

 Mr President, I would like to emphasise very strongly that the van den Burg report has come before Parliament at exactly the right moment, because this debate on supervision in Europe is one we need to have. Having said that, it is more important than ever to distinguish between the issue of supervision and that of regulation. I approve of the very open approach that Mrs van den Burg has adopted in her report. I also approve of the way she has accordingly examined the various supervisory models that we have within the European Union without prescribing a definitive model. I say that because we need to develop a common approach, we need to learn from our experience, and we need above all to endeavour to keep this debate free of any dogmatic or ideological attitude towards a single position. That is why I believe that this report provides us with a good basis for the dialogue with the other institutions. I would now like to concentrate on the problems we face in connection with extending the Lamfalussy procedure, as what we are chiefly dealing with here is regulation. Mr President-in-Office, you were quite right in saying how necessary financial integration is, but that financial stability is also necessary. This is an area in which Parliament will not let itself be trumped by the Council or the Commission, because we believe that financial market stability is a good thing for the public and that we as Members of Parliament need to champion the preservation of that stability. We must, however, constantly ask ourselves whether the process selected will help to contribute to that stability. When I consider that just nine months ago I supported – with a very heavy heart – an agreement that meant the Lamfalussy procedure was introduced for the area of investment regulation, it seems rather premature for us to be discussing the ‘birth of the Lamfalussy triplets’, by which I mean the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure to the three new areas of banking, insurance and financial conglomerates, let alone support it. The issue here is not only, as I see it, that we do not yet have any experience whatsoever in this area. You know as well as I do that the first Lamfalussy directive, on market abuse, is still a long way from being transposed and that the second one is still waiting for a common position. No, the issue here is that the Commission has very clearly conceded that we still have no idea what urgent legislative proposals we may have to deal with. That is why it is so important for us to obtain an assurance from the Commission and from the Council that the eleventh commandment, transparency, will continue to be respected in the event of any extension of the Lamfalussy procedure. I think – and I am saying this expressly on behalf of this House – that we have scored some successes here. Transparency is certainly a core issue for a properly functioning democracy. We are not, however, just dealing here with the institutionalisation of further transparency mechanisms. No, we are also dealing with how we can make further progress with legislation. I believe that we have still not achieved institutional balance in the legislative procedure, and that we need to amend Article 202. Mr Bolkestein has on several occasions pointed out to us that Parliament always has the option of blocking a further directive through the codecision procedure. But it is not a question of us blocking anything. This is all about constructive mutual cooperation. That is why, Mr President-in-Office, I am expecting the Finance Council, and also the European Council in Copenhagen, to agree upon a political declaration on the need for a treaty amendment in relation to secondary legislation, in relation to Parliament's will as regards enablement, and also in relation to the right of call back, and that they will work to achieve this, not forgetting all the legal implications which are bound to flow from this. There must be parity between the Council and Parliament as parties to the codecision process. This is a core issue for the future of this parliamentary democracy, which at the end of the day we all wish to achieve through the convention and through the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.

 Mr President, enlargement is not just meant to bring peace, democracy and the rule of law; it is also, of course, meant to help raise the standard of living in the countries that will be joining us. Economic cooperation ended up being a formula for the European Union's success, and this formula is to be applied more widely to give us stability in the sense of peace – not only external, but also internal and social peace. Great economic insecurity lies in store for the candidate countries, and we have to get them to understand that we know what difficulties they will face. For example, we have been able to learn from the Economic and Monetary Committee's delegations what advances have been made, and which have proved difficult, in such areas as, for example, competition policy or the control of aid payments. This has also had an effect on jobs in the candidate countries and cannot be organised without it running the risk of rejection. We are, then, well aware of the credit that is due to the candidate countries for their efforts, but it is also evident that they, when they join, must not only be capable of functioning as market economies; they must also be able to stand the pace of competition. There is still room for improvement in this respect. I want to give just two examples of this – steelworking and shipbuilding – and propose to mention energy only in passing, even though it is equally important. That is why the Commission was right to insert safeguard clauses. I think the candidate countries will also be able to handle these, and we must see to it that these safeguard clauses are inserted in such a way that they do not affect this or that country in an arbitrary way. I am confident that the process of reform in the candidate countries will continue; indeed, it must continue and be a success, as it is not only the failure to inform the public in the European Union that is an issue here; it is also the lack of information in the candidate countries. It would be a good thing if we could help to resolve this problem.

 Mr President, the application of the Stability and Growth Pact has ended up in a dead end, because it has wrongly focused on current budget deficits rather than on the structural deficits, which are what really matter. How long the Commission has taken to admit this! I would like to remind you that this Parliament took the view in 1997 that the Stability and Growth Pact had to be flexibly applied, and there was a majority across the group boundaries in support of this. The Stability and Growth Pact is basically suited to being used as an instrument to coordinate European finance policies. The Economic and Monetary Union needs a regulatory framework, one that, when flexibly implemented, is able to take market trends into account. A rigid interpretation, on the contrary, would let budget deficits increase as a result of the ensuing more pronounced tendency to cyclical weakening and the associated reduction in revenues and increase in expenditure. The automatic stabilisers must, though, be applied by all, and comprehensively, when the economy as a whole is going through a slack period. Their use should not be tied to good behaviour clauses that cannot be made good, or else the goals of the Lisbon process – competitiveness, full employment and social cohesion – will be out of our reach. A balanced budget aims for the mid-point of a cycle, and this objective must always be considered against the background of the conditions of the economic climate. That is why neither the Treaty nor the Pact envisage permanent precision or provide for a binding timetable, nor would such a thing be compatible with any interpretation of the Pact that accorded with its purpose. What is unsatisfactory about the application of the Pact is the fact that it puts too little emphasis on economic growth, which means that a distinction has to be drawn between deficits that result from current expenditure and those arising from productive capital expenditure. This could be done if European financial policy were to be guided by reference to the structural deficit. Only then will the Stability and Growth Pact be able to play its part as a positive instrument of coordination. That includes, however, efficient coordination of economic policies, with Parliament involved. On this also, Mr Prodi and Mr Solbes Mira, I look forward to the Commission coming up with an unambiguous initiative. (Applause)

 Mr President, we – by which I mean not only the economic actors, but also the Member States and the European Union – have to stand firm on implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Mr Langen should not forget that we live in an internal market which is not meant to function in such a way that the lights go out all over Europe, but rather so that we try to create ecologically compatible and sustainable economic growth in the interests of employment and of saving the environment. This, in my view, makes it very right and proper that the Commission should take note of the fact that certain Member States are already engaged in emissions trading, and that, as has repeatedly been said today, certain of them already have previous achievements to their name in reducing carbon dioxide. This makes it particularly important that we should take 1990 as a base year. Let me, moreover, make the economic point that it is extraordinarily important that emissions certificates be granted free of charge. There is nothing to be gained from auctions; we have been shown that by our bitter experiences in the past, from the trade in banana licences to the auctioning of UMTS licences, and that is why it matters that this instrument should be granted free of charge. It is important from the investor's point of view, as this will not lead to enterprises being harmed by costs at the outset and this will also ensure that emissions trading does not work like a tax. Enterprises thus have at their disposal the resources they need for research and development and for the use of energy-saving, low-emission processes. Allocation without charge also guarantees that all involved are on an equal footing and that the procedure is transparent. I consider that to be of the utmost importance, and I must say that we welcome this proposal on economic grounds as well, because it ends up helping the price to take account of external costs. I would, though, beg the Commission to do everything possible to achieve a breakthrough on the taxation framework directive as well, as it cannot but help to supplement taxes on business and thus help Europe to successfully realise ...

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's stocktaking exercise illustrates very clearly how important it has been even to reflect on strategies at European level because, although responsibility for labour market policy lies with the national governments, when it comes to economic policy and social policy it really is time that we recognised that the internal market has contributed to making our national economies interdependent and at the same time to creating interdependent living and working conditions, with the result that we are quite simply compelled, as the European Parliament, as a European institution, also to find an adequate response to this challenge. That is why this stocktaking exercise actually does nothing other than invite us to join up procedures even more closely, and to support the Commission's streamlining initiative in economic, employment and social policy so that we gain even better instruments in these fields. We have to make it quite clear that we agree that if we wish to respond successfully to the challenges coordination has to be a European task. After all, these challenges are greater than ever before when we see that successes in employment are being cancelled out by weak economic growth and that poor labour market figures are in turn dampening growth. We must finally get used to the idea that we need to have an economic policy at EU level that also has to meet employment policy objectives, and that we need to pursue a modern EU employment policy that secures sustainable and high-quality growth for everyone. This bond needs to be emphasised as we look towards the future. I have to say that quite honestly I really hope that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference will succeed in making a breakthrough in this regard, so as to enshrine the Lisbon process in a constitution, in particular with the aim of full employment. Allow me to make three further comments on practical and comprehensive actions which seek actually to increase employment intensity in the European Union and which are in particular also very important from an economic policy point of view. Firstly, employment intensity can certainly also be increased further through taxation measures, for example by applying low rates of value-added tax to labour-intensive services. It is disappointing that so little progress has been recorded here. In addition, it should also be said that initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises need to be more closely interlinked than has been possible in the past. Thirdly, and this concerns the Employment Guidelines in particular, we should also consider whether we might establish a link with the guidelines in competition policy, that is in policy on state aids, where we of course have specific rules, so as to have exemptions to the ban on state aid when small and medium-sized enterprises are being promoted or jobs created. The approaches found there are, however, not necessarily reflected in the Employment Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines are not necessarily reflected in these rules either. In my view this is really vital, because aid is also a significant aspect, just as competition policy as a whole is an important policy area for promoting employment.

 Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council on the ambitious programme for the Asia Summit in Copenhagen. It is, in my view, particularly gratifying that there is a specific focus on dialogue on culture and civilisation, for it is particularly in these times that mutual understanding in this area is particularly important. All too often, there is still great misunderstanding despite the progress made in relations between Europe and Asia, which are distant rather than close, in contrast to relations with the ACP States or Latin America. We have to come to understand that the Asian states are not merely in economic or trading competition with us, but that they are genuinely important partners. Both Mr Maaten's report and also the communication from the Commission make it very clear that the strategic framework also has to highlight priority areas for political and strategic cooperation, in which area the strengthening of the United Nations will, on the one hand, certainly be a point of view that will carry weight, as will without any doubt, on the other hand, the bilateral and, as far as possible, joint efforts at tying the USA into a multilateral relationship. In this time of conflict, when we are faced with problems and challenges, it cannot be too often emphasised that it is most important that Asia and Europe should support a multipolar world. This is where we, as Europe's Parliament, can certainly play an important role with these reports and these debates, and the ASEP Summits could emphasise this. I really do consider that important. I would also like to emphatically underline the role to be played by the principle of detente and change through rapprochement in giving human rights and democracy issues priority. What have we achieved in Europe by means of this policy? Why can it not used to give us leverage in Asia? That we should be cooperating with the Asians in this way in the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in other areas affecting stability, is something I consider right and proper. I would like to take this opportunity to make another appeal. Another issue here is certainly cooperation between non-governmental organisations, as is the new relationship on the basis of equal rights, partnership and mutual understanding. What, though, will we have achieved if this remains confined to the heads of government, to the business world, or even to the parliaments? We have to include the young people of these continents of ours. With that in mind, I would like to encourage the Danish Presidency of the Council to do even more for the European-Asian summer schools and even more for mutual understanding between the young people of Asia and Europe.

Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to guarantee that economic, social and employment policies will be coordinated, as defined in the Lisbon process, and pursued in a democratically legitimate manner if it rejects changes to the Treaty within the framework of the Convention.

Mr President, I should like to endorse the rapporteur's positive appraisal of the Commission's proposal for a regulation. It is precisely because the private economy is failing to live up to its responsibility and create secure jobs that we need more aid to promote employment in the European Union. You only have to think about current mass unemployment and the different situations in the regions to realise that this regulation is crucial, because it creates greater transparency, cuts red tape, provides legal security and improves comparability and, with it, we shall soon be in a position to judge how effective aid is. It is interesting to note that national employment policies in the European Union have changed, gearing towards the common objectives of the employment strategy, with action plans being used as levers. But what struck us in this context is that the current employment guidelines make no reference to growth or to the desirable or undesirable effects of employment aid. We need to call for finishing touches to be put to the employment guidelines in the interests of mainstreaming and the coherence of European employment policies. We need to clarify that the contribution of both sides – employment policy and competition policy – to the European employment strategy can be guaranteed. I think that, in the proposal before us, the Commission rightly recognises the need to allow state measures in the form of employment incentives for companies, especially for certain disadvantaged groups. This is not just a logical consequence of the objectives set in Lisbon. Full employment is and always will be one of the most important objectives of the Lisbon strategy, Barcelona confirmed that. Which is why we must call for finishing touches in the form of a more flexible definition of which groups are to benefit. I think that the age limit of 25 should be raised to 30 and that the age limit for older employees should be dropped from 55 to 50, because society relies on both, young people entering employment and older people remaining in employment. I should also like to call for special care to be taken to ensure that the differentiation which the Commission rightly makes in its proposal between small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies does in fact apply when this proposal is implemented.

 Mr President, the European Commission's proposal on the reform is welcome. After all, it is far-sighted to embark on a process of modernisation and reform at this stage, notwithstanding the successful history of the Regulation on merger control. I also think it is far-sighted since account is already being taken of the enlargement processes. I endorse the rapporteur's report – as, indeed, does my group – but I also share the concern, for example, that some of the proposals set out in the Green Paper cannot actually be achieved in practice. For this reason, it is very important to ensure that the Commission gives its pledge that the issue of definitions, but also the replacement of the dominance test, will not be held over until other occasions in the future when the Regulation is reviewed again. I think this applies especially to the international dimension of the merger processes and especially to the innovative areas in which mergers are taking place. The number of transnational corporate mergers has risen steadily in recent years. Their growing number and complexity are undoubtedly one reason for reviewing the division of competence and adopting new arrangements on coordination between national and EU competition authorities. I welcome the greater concentration on the Commission as a central contact point in the interests of efficiency, transparency, legal certainty, a shortening of deadlines and reducing the administrative burden on companies, and I also expressly endorse the Commission's indication that it may be necessary to create an additional judicial instance. What must be examined in detail, however – and here I disagree with the previous speakers – is the major impact of mergers, especially on employment, and the criteria and procedures for examining the permissibility of a merger. Throughout the EU, thousands of jobs have been lost as a result of such restructuring. Companies should undoubtedly have the greatest possible freedom to make management decisions, but it is often the largest employer in a region which carries out these restructuring plans. The resulting job losses do not only affect the individual workers; they also have an impact on economic and social cohesion in the region as a whole. I would like to remind you in this context that the Nice European Council expressly described economic performance as being inseparable from social progress. This must be taken into account in competition law and competition policy, also within the framework of merger controls.

 Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports Mrs Kauppi's report. It is true, in view of this year's presentation, that the European Central Bank is especially to be congratulated not only on having managed to make the eurozone an object lesson in the importance of the euro as a response to external shocks, but also on the introduction of euro notes and coins having been so successful. We have detected some dissatisfaction with the new money on the part of some members of the public, but Europe has in any case demonstrated that it can achieve something when it stands shoulder to shoulder. According to one survey, 64% of all members of the public at last feel a little more like Europeans now they have the euro in their pockets. That is the way it should be! The public's price awareness, however, is not as it should be, as the real rate of price increase in the eurozone, which is statistically verifiable and extremely low, does not relate to the inflation that people perceive. Parliament was therefore right always to back a campaign of information and to insist that the introduction of euro notes and coins should be understood as a conversion not merely in the technical sense, but also as one with great psychological significance. That being the case, it is also important that we should send out positive signals. The fact that consumers can sense overnight the advantages of monetary union when they use a card to withdraw cash, is very important. More advantages will become apparent, for example in the holiday season that is just beginning. That is certainly attributable to Parliament's efforts. I will now briefly consider the concerns about the revaluation of the euro. Euro/US dollar exchange rate convergence certainly makes a slow curve desirable, but that cannot be controlled. It cannot, then, be emphasised too strongly that falling import prices in this phase of a slow recovery in the eurozone facilitate an environment that favours an expansive monetary policy and do not in any case necessitate decisions to change interest rates in any direction. The EU is dependent on this in order to keep the Lisbon process on track. The European Central Bank bears a great responsibility. It is to be hoped that the coordination of economic policies will at last actually create a favourable environment for all the actors. There have recently been less favourable developments in the aggregate money supply, which, however, have a silver lining in that they indicate recovery, being a sign that enterprises are obtaining liquidity for investment in future economic growth, and this, for Europe, is a matter of life and death. I do think it important that there should be even greater transparency in the European Monetary Union. I set great store by the European Central Bank's willingness to listen to Parliament's arguments that we should know all the reasoning underlying decisions on monetary policy. That is also good for the European Central Bank's credibility and trustworthiness. The European Central Bank also has the task of helping to build up financial stability. It counts for a lot with me that the European Central Bank should continue to promote financial stability and, unlike the American Federal Reserve, should not allow its monetary policy to support the creation of speculative bubbles. Even in future, the ECB must not permit its own conduct to give rise to moral hazards!

 Madam President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, and I think that this report really enables us to make progress on an issue of great significance politically, economically, and in terms of environmental and energy policy. Producing and utilising fuels derived from biomass is a political and economic alternative to importing oil. The transport sector's demand for energy will continue to grow. That is evident to all of us, as society is becoming ever more mobile and the number of vehicles on Europe's roads will also continue to increase dramatically after EU enlargement. Europe's economy and jobs are inevitably dependent on security of supply, so fiscal support is the right way ahead, as we can expect the production of fuels from biomass to completely replace the import of fuel oil as soon as a few decades hence. It is therefore right and proper for Europe-wide fiscal instruments to promote biofuels over a transitional period. A common internal market demands more than the development of instruments by some states and not by others. Because they contain a proportion of carbon dioxide and need to be mixed with petroleum, biofuels are currently subject to the duty levied on petroleum products. It is therefore also right that we recommend to the plenary that it should go beyond the Commission proposal and consider as a possible incentive not only reduced rates of duty but also actual exemption from it, in order to make progress with further deliberate promotion of biofuels. As fiscal benefits, whether in the form of reductions or exemptions, lead to marked cost reductions, the competitiveness of biofuels can be guaranteed. This promotion can simultaneously create jobs in agriculture and plant engineering, leading in turn to higher tax yields and social security contributions. In the final analysis, the production of biofuels is labour-intensive and has a greater impact on employment than the production of conventional fuels. More favourable fiscal treatment at Community level is in accordance with the principles of the internal market and will also tend to enhance the EU's competitiveness. There may be resultant innovations in the areas of process engineering, cultivation and harvesting, and also in the production of motor vehicles. Community-wide requirements for biofuels to be of a quality standard compatible with state-of-the-art motors would make it possible for motor engineering to advance to the point of producing the zero-emission car, which would probably be an export winner. All this enhances growth and creates jobs, as does the export of relevant products and processes to countries that are at present economically dependent on imported oil.

 Mr President, reforming the Rules of Procedure so as to enable Parliament to function in a particularly efficient, democratic and transparent fashion was certainly a very major challenge for the rapporteurs. I think it can also help to consolidate plenary's political image. It is therefore very important to steer clear of every tendency to make plenary's work bureaucratic. On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I welcome the incorporation of proposals for dialogue with the European Central Bank and also those on the economic policy guidelines. In this context, I would like to emphasise that relationships between the institutions change over a certain period of time. We really do have to change the nature of these relationships and fill them with new life over and over again. This should be a general characteristic of future debates on the Rules of Procedure; these debates should not be matters of no consequence, but should make it clear that, in this Parliament of ours, rules are not made as ends in themselves but, on the one hand, they are made in order to improve the quality of the work done and to tighten up working procedures and give them more focus and, on the other hand, in order to bring to light those essential aspects that are important for enhancing Parliament's political standing in the eyes of the public. It is at this point that I have to touch on something which, in my view, the rapporteurs and we as plenary have to reconsider. I consider Amendment No 59 to Article 110a to be problematic. I can see the justified concern to do everything possible to really get the right and important political debates conducted in plenary, but not all debates on foreign or security policy are, by definition, of greater value than, for example, the issues that are brought to a conclusion in the specialist committees, because it has become clear that only a huge majority can prepare the way for a second reading and for success in a contest with the Council. The new rules must not lead to a situation in which, at the conclusion of a debate in a committee, we organise non-existent pseudo-majorities to vote against a report in order to comply with the formal requirements for getting it debated in plenary. I really would consider that an avoidable piece of bureaucracy. Perhaps the rapporteurs will come up with a better selection procedure and thus enable us to reach agreement this week. I really do think it important that this amendment should not be adopted in the form proposed. I would also ask the rapporteur to clarify what he expects Parliament and the committees to do with Amendments Nos 87 and 88, as we are not an executive, for which farthings or pennies or cents and … (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, this report is intended as a contribution to the revision of the Treaties and as a contribution to a European constitution. Draft constitutions are always politically motivated and include strategic and tactical objectives and considerations as well as aspects of power politics. The Spinelli draft back in 1984 accepted the competences of the EU and the division of labour between the EU and the Member States, just as the Lamassoure report quite rightly does today. And the question of competences is even more important now, especially in the area of the economic constitution and economic legislation. If European economic policy is to be a success and the European social model is to subsist, the competence of the Union in the important areas of the internal market in the broadest sense, the four freedoms – namely financial services, competition, customs and monetary policy – must be retained and the report rightly emphasises this. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considers that the division of competences in the report is lacking in democratic legitimacy as far as policy coordination is concerned. We already know from experience with economic policy coordination that competence for coordination needs to rest with the Union if we are to avoid previous shortcomings. It is not just a question of the democratic control which needs to be exercised by the European Parliament here; no, what we are trying to do as far as policy coordination is concerned – especially economic policy coordination – is to move from negative to positive policy coordination. Positive policy coordination requires both clear democratic legitimacy and unified implementation. The broad economic guidelines, for example, ought therefore to be set jointly by the Council and the European Parliament, based on a formal proposal from the Commission. This would then serve as an example for other political areas in which coordination should and must be exercised. The authority, indeed the moral obligation, to set up such a far-reaching framework in the interest of economic welfare is provided by the Principles chapter of the EC Treaty, which lists among Union activities the adoption of an economic policy based on the definition of common objectives which can and must achieve, in particular, harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and sustainable, non-inflationary growth, as well as social protection. In keeping with the Lisbon process, I am calling in the strongest possible terms for the European Parliament to come down in favour of policy coordination which deserves to be described as such and which makes it quite clear that policies in the general interest can only succeed if the common interest factor is also visible. (Applause)

 Mr President, I propose that Parliament should confirm Mr Lukas Papademos's appointment as Vice-President of the European Central Bank, in accordance with the committee's unanimous vote. Confirmation of the proposed candidate is not merely a matter of course. It results from a hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and therefore has to do with monetary policy being transparent. Experts may well know the President of the Central Bank, but Europe's citizens do not, yet they must be able to trust the Vice-President. As a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, he will have a part in decisions on the euro zone's monetary policy which will affect growth and employment and thus people's lives. After all, it is money that must serve people, not the other way round. Decisions on monetary policy are the work of man, which means that they primarily call for personal integrity and character, skills, great experience of the economy and monetary affairs, and also a willingness to be candid. The hearing emphasised the importance of these qualifications. The new Vice-President is the first new member of the first Executive Board, which was so successful in preparing and introducing the euro. What underlines the independence of the members of the Executive Board is that re-election to it is not permitted, and so this is renewed proof of personal independence. The European Central Bank's independence – which I must re-emphasise today – is truly a constituent element in European Monetary Union. At the end of the day, policy on money and currency is not neutral. No institutions in a democracy can be infallible or function under the cloak of darkness; rather, democracy and integration policy make the transparency of decisions and of the reasons behind them inseparable from the European Central Bank's role. Such transparency is, by the way, not only in the interests of European democracy, but also in the interests of the European Central Bank, which is thereby – and as recent years have clearly demonstrated – made more credible, more legitimate and more trustworthy. It is in the popular interest and in the interest of the market that we want to build up this authority. After all, as the renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter once said, a people's monetary affairs reflect everything that that people desires, endures, and is. It is Parliament's view that the European Central Bank is far more transparent than previous national central banks in Europe and that, that being the case, we have undergone a kind of cultural revolution in the countries of the euro zone. Parliament's dialogue with the European Central Bank on monetary affairs has made a real contribution to this. This is not, in the final analysis, just about the publication of monthly, quarterly or annual reports, but also, in fact, about a monetary dialogue to question not only decisions on monetary policy but also the background to them. We who are in Europe's Parliament, though, must continue to insist on these publications being followed by the publication of brief Minutes and of the voting record. The US Federal Reserve has just decided to announce, on the same day that decisions on monetary policy are taken, how the individual members of its Board of Governors voted on them, so that everyone can know who voted for what. For Parliament, the publication of the voting record without names would be every bit as adequate as publishing the arguments for or against a particular decision, as what is important for us to know is that they have not only, in fact, given consideration to price stability, the primary objective of monetary policy, but also to its secondary objective, namely the European Union's support for growth and employment. It is interesting to note that an American study emphasises that, in the USA, the way Federal Reserve Board members vote is determined not only by the problems posed by the risk of inflation, but also by the problem of unemployment. It would be reassuring to learn that members of the Board of the European Central Bank were influenced by this in view of it being the secondary task of monetary policy, as I have said, to support growth and employment, and in view of it having hitherto been unclear to Parliament how the European Central Bank defines the achievement of this second objective. This very year, it will be crucial to achieve clarity on this point, because the faltering recovery in Europe should not be halted by decisions on monetary policy. It became very clear, in Mr Papademos' vice-presidential nomination hearing, how important the interpretation of these objectives in Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community is to him, and so I would again like to reiterate our support for his appointment, the legitimacy of which should be underlined by this confirmation procedure, even if it lacks significance in law. Anything else would require reform of the Treaty establishing the European Community. (Applause)

 Commissioner, in your report today you referred to the difficult revenue situation in the Member States, which is partly due to the structural reforms proposed by the Commission. Is it not time to start concentrating more on structural deficits when considering deficits in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the stability and convergence programmes? Or should we simply be insisting on qualification of expenditure as is the case in the USA when public finances are being discussed?
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 Mr President, the interdependence between macropolicy and full employment is evident. If we are to achieve full employment and raise the employment rate to the level of other regions of the world, we need growth over and above growth in productivity. We also need full employment to step up internal demand and to achieve gross income from the EU Member States. This is a prerequisite if we are to achieve sustainable growth at a high level over a substantial period, and a prerequisite that needs to be expressed more clearly in the broad guidelines for economic policies and which needs to be made clearer in the guidelines for Member States. The present guidelines are still too much geared towards structural reforms. But such reforms have only limited scope for acting as an engine for growth and employment. No doubt the implementation of the financial action plan will partly close the gap in productivity between the EU and the USA, but only partly. That is why we need to aim for a higher level of investment. Increases in investment of 4% were possible in the USA during the 1990s, with a significant impact on growth and employment. So why not in the EU? There is not enough emphasis in the broad guidelines for economic policies on investment. I am not denying that it represents progress that all the EU Member States intend to invest 3% of their GDP in research and development, and that they also intend to invest more in human resources. After all, human resources are Europe's raw material. However, more needs to be invested in education and training if the knowledge-based society is to become a reality in Europe. Investment would need to rise from 21% to 25%. This applies primarily to private investment needed to create production capacity and jobs which would make this sustainable growth possible in the longer term, but which would also promote technological progress and thus contribute in turn to increased demand. But public-sector investment also needs to increase. In this field we chiefly need investment in infrastructure, which was particularly hit because of the consolidation process in 2001, with a level of 2.3% of GDP. A target of 3% needs to be introduced for stability programmes here. I think that is worth considering. By way of conclusion I would like to mention that the Commission is quite right to touch on the need for the coordination of fiscal policies. We know that companies are now critical of the fact that there is no scope for planning in the EU in relation to taxation and above all in relation to cross-border economic activity, something we would like to see. As much provision as possible should therefore be made in the broad guidelines for economic policies to ensure coordination where there are disruptions in the functioning of the internal market.

 Mr President, I would like to sincerely congratulate the three rapporteurs, and I believe that this cooperation between the Commission and the Council should set the pattern for future discussions. I believe it is very important for the Commission and the Council to work towards strengthening the way the European Parliament functions in this area, as provided for in the Lamfalussy report, so that we can also exercise our democratic rights in the monitoring committee while preserving complete neutrality. The three directives that we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow aim to overcome the fragmentation of Europe's financial markets, to enhance their attractiveness and competitiveness, and at the same time also to strengthen financial stability and consumer protection. The elimination of obstacles to market access and bureaucratic regulations, the removal of antiquated and rigid supervisory structures and their replacement by flexible and market-oriented supervisory rules and instruments are indispensable requirements for the creation of an integrated financial market and for ensuring the competitiveness of Europe's financial service providers. However, this should not be allowed to jeopardise financial stability or to lead to a deterioration in consumer rights as regards cross-border transactions. We should make total transparency and strict regulatory and supervisory mechanisms, including appropriate sanctions, the hallmark of the quality of Europe's financial markets. It is of course also important to regain the confidence of private investors in this sort of saving, not least in the interest of building up fully funded supplementary retirement pensions. We do not need statements of good conduct for this, but just clear and binding regulations underpinned by appropriate sanctions. The same applies to the Directive on financial conglomerates, which will most certainly take integration an important step further forward. If they are to remain competitive in the face of the globalisation and internationalisation of the finance markets, Europe's financial companies need to reposition themselves in the market, and the growing number of takeovers and mergers in this context demonstrates that this process is in full swing. This structural shakedown in order to create internationally competitive companies is certainly to be welcomed. However, it should not lead to a situation in which financial groups and conglomerates of this kind are increasingly no longer subject to the supervision that up to now has been organised at national level and in most Member States, even at sectoral level. Enron has generally highlighted the risks involved in multi-layered and inadequately supervised finance groups. The directive before us will create an important harmonised European legal basis for cooperation between supervisory authorities, and it will also prevent multiple gearing of own funds instruments within a group. In order to avoid excessive administrative burdens, we believe that we are right in calling for responsibility for the supervision of financial conglomerates and groups to be transferred to a single supervisory authority, which will be established on the basis of legally defined criteria. It is also especially important here that we have fortunately managed to reach a compromise with regard to the scope of the directive and also as regards multiple gearing of prudential capital, a compromise that my group also fully supports.

 Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, very warmly for his report, which makes it very clear what progress still needs to be made in this field. I would also like to thank Mr Della Vedova very sincerely for his well-balanced proposal. We all know what a difficult area EU tax coordination is. Virtually no one is talking about tax harmonisation any more. At the same time, we also know that tax competition can have very harmful effects on Europe's economies and on the choice of locations for investment in the European Union. I would specifically like to thank Mr Della Vedova for having highlighted the issue of codecision by the European Parliament again in his role as rapporteur, since I believe that in the context of treaty reform and the discussions on a European constitution we also need to consider where the boundaries of national sovereignty lie when it comes to taxation policy. So we also need to adopt new approaches in order to define where it is in the general interest to set cornerstones for tax policy. I therefore believe that the Convention would be well advised to tackle this subject as well and to call for treaty reforms providing for a move away from the unanimity rule and towards the majority rule in EU tax policy. We are of course still a very long way from that, if we look at this really excellent paper and the very pragmatic but at the same time very accurate paper by the Commission. The Commission has quite rightly taken stock in a rather sobering way as regards coordination. The situation on value added tax is certainly disappointing, because we are still a long way from applying the country of origin principle. The pragmatic approach adopted by the Commission should therefore be supported, even if we should never lose sight of our ultimate goal. However, it is hard to reconcile various other areas of tax coordination with a forward-looking approach. I believe that in the case of company taxation we are still a long way from achieving what the Monti Package was at one point attempting to do. In any case, we need to make sure that tax havens are finally abolished and that favourable tax treatment for non-resident legal or natural persons, which distort competition, is finally eliminated. That should be our objective, together with the minimum requirement for uniform definitions in tax law, ranging from the basis of assessment to definitions of profit. I would very much welcome it if we in the European Parliament could agree on a single set of definitions for these arrangements. That would certainly encourage national governments to take a more progressive line.

 Mr President, let me say a few words about the Mediterranean Bank. I welcome the way the Barcelona process is being made deeper and given a more definite form. I would again like a definite answer about something I cannot comprehend, namely why you decided against this facility, which, in this year alone, could demonstrate with what commitment we are working on a pro-active Mediterranean policy, whereas – as we learned from our experience with the foundation of the ‘Bank for Eastern Europe’ – a bank or its subsidiary needs a longer period of time even to become operational, and is much more expensive in terms of personnel and budget allocations. Quite apart from that, have you even found a political solution to the problem? If we need partners in the Arab states – where there are already so many funds that certainly not all the Arab states will get involved – what will you do if Israel also wants to participate in this bank? Would this not handicap its foundation from the start, and would it not therefore be better to start work on a facility capable of demonstrating to everyone the European Union's commitment to a Mediterranean policy? Let me ask in conclusion: When will the Commission, as guardian of the treaties and thereby obliged to watch over the Member States' commitment to Europe as a community based on law, send a warning letter to Member States which jeopardise the rule of law?

Mr President, Mr Maystadt, the Lisbon Process cannot be imagined without the European Investment Bank. Support for SMEs and for entrepreneurship as sources of employment is becoming more important, as external finance other than through banks is becoming more expensive and bank finance for small and medium-sized enterprises is becoming more and more problematic. When we consider what the European Investment Bank has achieved since 1968, in terms both of funds and of initial support for projects, I consider the outcome to be an impressive one. I must say that the integration of the EIF and the EIB under one roof, which was pushed through by the Lisbon Process, has resulted in an optimisation of the European Investment Bank's activities right across the board. I would therefore ask those who now want to push for the founding of another bank, to rely on, and make use of, the competence and qualified expert staff that the European Investment Bank has at its disposal. It is for that reason that I oppose the founding of another bank. It would surely also be in the interests of the Central and Eastern European States for the work of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and that of the European Investment Bank to be more efficiently harmonised and coordinated with each other. I am therefore sure that both the European Investment Bank's quality and its financial activity will be improved still further, or advanced, at the European Summit in Madrid, due, among other things, to the European Commission's consolidated report. As has been pointed out by my fellow Members and also in Mr Schmidt's report, one must surely see to it that the best possible use is made of funds for small and medium-sized enterprises. It will, without doubt, be a matter for our concern that there may be a decreasing number of small and medium-sized banks and financial institutions available with which the European Investment Bank can manage the flow of its funds. So it is, of course, very encouraging that the European Investment Bank has a network of 130 active intermediaries and that activity in Italy has now resumed to an encouraging extent. We should bear in mind, though, that what matters, above all, is that small and medium-sized enterprises should really be enabled to get access to working capital and also risk-capital financing at their local level. It is therefore important, Mr Maystadt, that an assessment should be submitted of what influence this activity by the European Investment Bank has actually had on growth and employment at local and regional level. Regional development is, after all, one of its main fields of activity. We know that the whole European Union benefits if economic and social cohesion can be realised at regional level. So this assessment must be carried out, as should in future be done, before the Spring Summits, so that even better use may be made of the European Investment Bank's instruments. One final plea, Mr President. All the institutions are committed to the need for gender mainstreaming. I have noted that progress has been made in appointments to the European Investment Bank. There is so far, unfortunately, only one woman on its board, and so the Member States are urged to give women, too, the facilities and opportunities to play their part in the Investment Bank's work. I also note that, at its highest level of management, only one of the twelve officials is a woman. There must be changes here.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I want to vigorously emphasise that nobody in this House underestimates the significance of the financial markets. We all know how important it is that we catch up on the United States' integrated market in terms of the productivity of capital. On the other hand, we are also aware that the European financial market has significance not only for enterprises but also for those who rely on proper provision for old age, in other words who are, as consumers, dependent on it in view of their small pensions. Parliament therefore bears a heavy responsibility for coming to the right decisions in the co-decision procedure. In today's proceedings, with our debate on the von Wogau report, we have an extremely sensitive topic to deal with. The rapporteur has attempted to find cautious formulations in order to give a chance to all the parties who are particularly sensitive to the effects of this legislative process. I wish to underline again that Parliament, which demands more and more rights of co-decision, will not refrain from doing so in the parliamentary legislative procedure and that today's compromise in the von Wogau report is without prejudice to the possibility of Parliament giving up this legal position. If we come to a transitional arrangement for secondary legislation today, that will only mean that we as a Parliament had previously been unable to push through the cementing of secondary legislation in the Treaty. That had previously been a matter for the Commission. In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to Mr Bolkestein for the fact that our negotiations on governance, laborious and difficult though they were, nonetheless succeeded in getting this formulation incorporated into the White Paper as a Commission proposal. That is a success in which we all share. Now we also have to achieve a successful conclusion to the next Intergovernmental Conference and the next amendment of the Treaties. That is, without a doubt, very important. One question, though, has not been answered – that of to what extent we can actually attribute real significance to the Lamfalussy procedure in all this legislation, because all of what has been described as technical, today, is very often political. Parliament cannot be satisfied with a role legislating only in outline; we must rather still hold on to our authority to define, item by item, detail by detail, paragraph by paragraph, and article by article. We shall pay attention to that. I think it should also be clear, Mr Prodi, following your statement and also Mr Bolkestein's, that we will also take care to ensure that Mr Bolkestein's letter of 2 October to the committee will also, as an interpretation, be part of this protocol. The third thing that is clear is that, by its two statements, the Commission is committing itself, today, in the implementation of the Lamfalussy procedure, not, under any circumstances, to follow the recommendations of the Securities Committee against a qualified majority. This was, fortunately, clear today. So I think we can be full of optimism and constructive spirit in approaching this form of cooperation on the basis of parity and equivalence. (Applause)

Mr President, there has been a qualitative change in the form of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. This shows me, though, how necessary it actually is to have secondary legislation on a basis that accords with the Treaties. I just want to ask whether the Commission is now, at last, declaring itself willing to grant the competent committee in Parliament, the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, observer status on the Securities Committee and invite it to the meetings on a regular basis.

Mr President, I would like to point out, in addition to this, that we want to submit a second report. We hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that there should be a compromise with the position taken by Parliament, whose Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well known to have voted the first proposal down, but which is now prepared to draw up a new proposal in the Katiforis report, one which we are keen to present to the whole House in February. In February, the Council of Finance Ministers will still have enough time to come to a decision about it. Accordingly, I have also written to the Spanish Presidency of the Council on the Committee's behalf, and have also informed the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rato of it during last week's meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. That being so, I do not think that the request for urgent procedure should be agreed to.

Mr President, the introduction of euro notes and coins has not only been a success in logistical and organisational terms, but is also already contributing to the enhanced creation and discovery of a European identity. Not even Eurosceptics in Italy can do anything about that. (Applause)
 The tangible euro makes Europe a fact of daily life, just as we MEPs always said it would. The euro was, in a manner of speaking, Parliament's first choice since it was itself directly elected, a choice above all by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs To that extent, the euro has for two decades been one of Parliament's successful projects. We took our stand for a market and a currency and played our part in creating them. I think that thanks are owed to all the Members of this House, and to you too, Mr von Wogau. (Applause)
 ‘Euro’ will in my view become the affirmative word of 2002. After all, the euro embodies Europe's dynamism and determination to create a European identity, improve European competitiveness for the benefit of the economy and employment and grow together into permanent mutual solidarity. Monetary union completes the internal market – the right answer to the challenges of globalisation – and makes it at last work for everyone, for small and medium-sized enterprises and above all for people. The euro will become a success because it is accepted not only by the markets but also by people. Many are at last rejoicing – as we Members always predicted they would – to be living in Euroland. The success of the introduction of euro notes and coins fills everyone with enthusiasm and creates the climate of optimism that we in Europe urgently need for investment, stimulation of internal demand and thus for employment. The introduction of euro notes and coins crowns and rewards the sustained efforts on the road towards monetary union. Today, many people are already wondering why euro notes and coins had not been introduced much earlier, something we Members had always demanded. We call upon Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain to come into the eurozone in their own interest before eastward enlargement takes place. The German mark was a currency with a proud past. Three years of monetary union promise us an equally stable monetary future. There have in any case been lower interest rates under monetary union than in the decades of the German mark that preceded it. This is connected with the low level of interest, which guarantees good financial conditions that favour investment. It follows that monetary union has kept to what was promised politically in the Maastricht Treaty, namely price stability. The introduction of euro notes and coins, then, also brings visible successes for consumers: prices for consumer durables, such as cars, will fall. By its completion of the internal market programme, the euro also at last makes possible consumer-friendly competition, which will lead to medium-term pressure on prices and an incentive to higher quality. The completion of economic and monetary union, of the internal reform of the European Union and of a European constitution and the successful eastward enlargement of the EU are the great challenges that Europe must face up to. There is one thing, though, that we must not forget: the euro is not only a monetary project; it was always a political project and is a component of the political union of Europe. Europe is small in global terms, and so the internal market, completed by monetary union, is quite certainly the right answer. The euro, moreover, puts to the test the ability of Europeans to organise unity in the interests of all Europe's states. As far as further bold European projects are concerned, it is both a connecting link between them and a stumbling block. William Shakespeare was right to maintain that ‘if money go before, all ways do lie open’. It is to be hoped that that applies also to more efficient and improved coordination of economic, financial, employment and social security policies. The euro urgently needs to be accompanied by some sort of economic government. Cyclic developments are no longer triggered by nation states, but by economic issues, and so the EU summit in Barcelona has been required to exchange dogmatism in handling the Stability and Growth Pact, which does leave some room to manoeuvre, for a sound policy which is committed to monetary, financial and also social stability. Our commitment as a Parliament to monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank was particularly important. We took our stand in Parliament for the independence of the European Central Bank, but also demonstrated our commitment to that institution's democratic accountability. Hence it is very important that we should have organised and motivated a cultural revolution in Europe, for the Member States' dealings with the national central banks used not to have the democratic accountability we have now. Money policy thus becomes transparent and comprehensible and helps us to fathom this mystery as well. For money policy is not neutral; it too has an influence on the real economy, on growth and employment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding is extremely important, for shipbuilding is a strategically significant sector in the European Union. I would like to take this opportunity to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, regrettably, does not coincide with that of the rapporteur. I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, for her outstanding work, especially in view of the very short time available to her. I would therefore like to thank her, even though she has difficulty in accepting the legality of this proposal. Naturally, my Committee has examined this issue and concludes that the right legal basis has been selected and that the concerns regarding the proposal's legality are unfounded. I therefore wish to comment briefly on the content of the proposal and the report. It would be remiss of me, however, if I omitted to mention the constructive cooperation with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. I think we have put forward a sound proposal. I very much hope, too, that the Commission will adopt the amendments proposed by this House. The conclusions of the Industry and Energy Council of 5 December 2000, in accordance with the 1998 Council decision, confirmed the ending of operating aid for shipbuilding from 1 January 2001. However, it was pointed out at the time that if the negotiations with Korea failed, the Commission could adopt a different position after a review. We must recognise that Korea has failed to honour the 2000 agreement in terms of price discipline and subsidies. The Commission therefore had to examine whether, in the event of the failure of negotiations with Korea, which continues to violate current trade agreements by granting state subsidies, a temporary defensive mechanism should be proposed for European shipbuilding. The proposal has now been submitted because the negotiations failed, and the proposed defensive mechanism must be evaluated. From the Committee's point of view, the proposal is inadequate, as it is restricted solely to container ships and tankers for transporting petroleum products and chemicals (excluding stainless steel tankers). The proposal allows operating aid of 6% and, in special cases, of up to 14%. A dispute settlement procedure is also to be initiated before the World Trade Organisation (WTO). These aid measures are to be applicable only until the conclusion of proceedings, that is, until 31 December 2002 at the latest. We believe that the European Parliament should maintain its position that a dispute settlement procedure should be initiated. However, this proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is in need of improvement, since the three segments referred to only account for 20% of European shipbuilding. Yet almost every segment in the European Union is affected by Korea's unfair competition practices. In particular, those categories of ships which will also be the subject of the complaint to the WTO must be included. Only then will our message to Korea be clear and convincing. In this respect, Commissioner, I believe that your support for Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is essential. The duration envisaged is also inadequate, in our view. We therefore propose that the defensive mechanism should be applicable at least for the duration of the current Regulation on aid to shipbuilding, Regulation 1540/98, which expires on 31 December 2003, or possibly until the conclusion of the WTO proceedings. As the European Parliament, and as the European Union, we must not allow unfair trade practices to damage European business and put jobs at risk. Otherwise, these unfair practices will emerge in other sectors too, impeding growth and threatening jobs. At the same time, however, we must strike a careful balance between justified defensive mechanisms and anti-market protectionism benefiting certain sectors through State aid, which impedes fair competition. I believe that the Committee's proposal takes account of these concerns. I would ask you to support the draft report, and I appeal to the Commission to state its willingness to adopt the amendments.
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 Mr President, I think that the Commission proposal has, in fact, come just at the right time, better late than never, and makes it clear that the currency union is not only being completed in the interests of the markets and business, but also in the interests of consumers. I should like to recall that we have been working on this issue for over 10 years, as the rapporteur rightly said, and that we have always supported self-regulation and voluntary agreements, but that in this sector it has, in the end, always been necessary to adopt legislation, in order for example to bring about quicker, more reliable and above all cheaper transfers. Here I am, of course, also thinking of the double charges which both those who made transfers and those who received them had to pay. Happily, this is now in the past, but this experience in the European Parliament taught us precisely that it is necessary to enact legislation. That is why I welcome both the tone and form of the regulation. It does not dictate prices, but it does state quite clearly that domestic and cross-border credit transfers must be treated on the same footing because we are in an internal market. This internal market requires a European payment system, and not just for large payments, like TARGET, but also for retail payments, for the transfer of small amounts. Everyone is affected by this: mothers or fathers who have children studying or undergoing training abroad; those of us who order books or wish to pay for a journey or a hotel in another European country. Those who have a holiday flat or even a holiday home are affected by this. All of them suffer as a result of this situation, including migrant workers who receive their wages in one country and want to send them home to their families. We need to think of them. An average of EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 is quite simply too much and unacceptable. I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal. We have tried everything; now we need to make decisions. I must also say that I do not understand Mr Karas's plea. Why should a proposal be forthcoming now, in the next two or three weeks, when it has been overdue for over 15 years? I have to say also that the proposals to postpone all of this to 2005 are really unacceptable in my view. The rapporteur's argument is as far as I am prepared to go, and I therefore think that we need to secure a broad majority in favour of this long-awaited project here in Parliament, because a European payment system would have been a reality long ago if the banks and building societies had wanted it.

 Mr President, in March 2000, the Lisbon European Council set out a new strategy for the coming decade. At that time we were working on the basis of very optimistic economic data and really thought that we could bring about sustainable growth of at least 3%, along with economic reform, full employment and also social inclusion. Today our starting point is more difficult because the global economy has gone in the opposite direction and even the European Union, despite its readiness to reform and the reforms which it has already implemented, is experiencing an economic downturn. That is why the following question is now much more urgent than it was during the preparations for the first spring summit in Stockholm: how does the Commission intend to continue this ambitious process of making the European Union, on the basis of innovation and knowledge, the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, and enabling it to overcome the problems which I have described? This question is all the more pertinent for the spring summit in Barcelona because, after evaluating a strategy of this kind for two years, it ought to be possible to identify the areas where national and European policy have actually been guided by the quantitative and qualitative objectives and see to what extent it has been possible to bundle measures together and make them visible. The Member States' budgets have actually shown uniform increases across the board in investment in research and development, innovation and further development of the information and communication society. The few figures which are available to us in the European Parliament unfortunately do not yet speak the specific language which we would have liked, because we had hoped that the Lisbon strategy and its consistent implementation would also have yielded visible added value as a result of economic, financial, employment and social policy being coordinated at European level, so as to demonstrate to the public the benefits which European policy can have for them and quite specifically how it can improve their quality of life and work. We should certainly also ask what approach has been adopted to achieve the ambitious aim of increasing investment in the European Union. How has cross-border investment in infrastructure actually been made visible apart from through reports? The European Parliament needs to ask all of these questions because, in drafting its synthesis report, the Commission has the duty of actually producing a blueprint for the further consultations at the spring summit, which will then, of course, in the end, form the broad guidelines of the future economic policy of the European Union and its Member States. In the current economic downturn and at a time when we are also facing particular challenges because of the adverse economic consequences of the terrible terrorist acts of 11 September – and in considering these issues we have to take into account a new aspect, the collapse of consumer confidence – we must also ask ourselves the following question: what can we do to stop a self-fulfilling prophecy, which states that we are sliding into recession, from becoming a reality? The Commission therefore bears great responsibility for taking more of a lead on setting targets and taking more practical action to reform the economy, not only with respect to the labour market, but also with respect to the other markets, full employment and also social inclusion, by issuing specific guidance on these areas. Of course this also raises the question, and I should also like to address this particularly to you, Commissioner, of whether the tax situation, where unfortunately we still have countries pursuing independent national policies rather than coordinated ones, does not have an adverse impact on investment in the European Union and, in particular, on cross-border investment. Commissioner, the European Parliament is still not clear about how it is actually, finally to be involved in this whole process, which is now approaching its second spring summit. So far we have not been involved as partners in the macro-economic dialogue. There are no plans to organise another forum with all of the stakeholders, as was done before the Lisbon meeting. It really is legitimate to ask whether the European Parliament's involvement is adequate and whether it is therefore able to represent the interests of the people in this process of setting priorities for the European Union's economic and structural policy. We really are in a situation where we need to mobilise our forces and rally optimism. How do you envisage doing this in your synthesis report? What working methods do you intend to choose and which guidelines do you intend to issue in it?
Randzio-Plath (PSE

Mr President, I very much welcome the Belgian Presidency's use of the summit as an opportunity to put euro notes and coins at the top of the agenda. Monetary union is, after all, not only for large businesses but also for every citizen. I very much hope that this will be taken as a positive signal. I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission's proposal on charges for trans-frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction. We, the European Parliament, will, no doubt, also take this step in the next plenary session. The current situation as regards employment and the economy, that is, the state of the labour market, as well as consumer confidence, should surely be seen in a very critical light. I welcome the Commission's report to the Council on the appraisal of the economic consequences of the terrible events of 11 September. It is, I believe, important that we agree on a Community-wide approach. Not everywhere is there evidence of one. I believe that, in this situation, we must, now as in the past, stick with structural reforms and the advances they have achieved, particularly in the financial markets but also in the markets for goods and services and that we at the same time must not only underline the need for sound finances in the European Union and adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, but should also make use of the flexibility for which this Pact provides, for we need more investments in the European Union. Now as before, the Lisbon way is the right one, relying as it does on growth that is supported by investment and creates jobs and, above all, on mutual support in economic, employment and social policy. Only when all the macro-economic actors have played their parts can our policy in the European Union be successful. In these times of crisis we must hold fast to this, and the European Investment Bank, too, must be strengthened even more than previously in its task of helping public investments towards breakthroughs in the area of infrastructure. By this I mean trans-frontier infrastructure measures in the EU itself, but also such as will connect our European Union with the states of Central and Eastern Europe.

Mr President, thank you for your willingness to allow us this pleasure late in the evening. On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. We support this report because it gives the right solutions to the issues of the new financial architecture which must be created, of reform as a whole and of crisis management – solutions which also deal practically with the needs of regions hit by crises, the requirements of international financial markets and the very important need of all societies for stability in financial markets. I would like to emphasise again that I believe stability in financial markets to be a public good to which all citizens are entitled. Taking a look at the situation we are in, I cannot resist making an observation. International financial activity on the currency markets has, in fact, decreased to around USD 1 200 billion a day, and that is due to the creation of the monetary union, which is of course one of the levers of the flows of capital that are quantitatively scarcely manageable. At the same time, though, we must note that during the course of the nineties we were dealing with a twenty-five-fold turnover increase in derivative trading such as swaps, options and so on. We know that, now, not even 3% of the transactions have to do with the real market in goods and services. I believe it to be important that we should look at the flow of capital under the influence of globalisation in terms both, on the one hand, of the yield accruing to institutional investors and of the economic and social situation, and on the other, from the point of view of the capital-importing countries. In this connection, we have to bear in mind that 75% of the capital invested flows into only twelve states, and that only 1% of the capital invested flows to black Africa. The rapporteur is right to demand that we now move to a consolidation, and that can only be done if we write off debt more comprehensively than we have done before. Functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous. Presupposing stable development, they contribute to growth and employment. Despite that, there are still economic and social deficits and a lack of regulation and supervision. The report points that out. Concern about speculative commitments to the detriment of the real economy and the excessive volatility of the market brought about by an enormous increase in transaction volume for certain financial products are factors which make a reform of the international financial architecture more necessary than ever. We have lived through 120 currency crises, and they cannot be abolished. We have not yet succeeded in developing a working system of early warning indicators, in making information transparent and in drawing up a code of conduct that works for everyone, and we have not yet solved the problem of moral hazard. So I consider it very important that this report's demands should influence the EU's negotiations, and the EU, too, must speak with one voice at the international level. It is not just about us having a monetary zone, but we must also speak with one voice internationally on financial market policy and on issues of the world's financial architecture. The introduction of the euro is a contribution to financial stability, and our financial system is better protected against external shocks, but we must move on, for the monetary union is only one contribution to stability in Europe and the world.

 Mr President, all possible measures must be taken to ensure that Europe can provide a real answer to the consequences of the horrendous terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, and a part of that, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has in fact already been done, namely a joint response from the EU finance ministers. I think this symbolises Europe's ability to close ranks when the chips are really down. I believe that this policy should also be pursued further in relation to aid policy. However, it should also give us the flexibility we need, so as to demonstrate that Europe does not want the economic downturn to be further exacerbated. We do in fact have a Stability and Growth Pact that gives us many possibilities, because on the one hand we wish Europe to be a Community of stability, and on the other hand we also want to promote growth and employment. It is no accident that when applying the convergence criteria, exceptional circumstances have sometimes been applied and approved which allow the definition of an excessive deficit to be deviated from. I do not mean by that to speak in favour of a ‘Community of instability’. Just the opposite in fact, I wish to call on the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to contribute to further coordination in this area, by taking advantage of the fact that stability programmes can be updated. I would like to see updated stability programmes for the euro countries which make it clear that the data has significantly changed. What is needed in this context, as you quite rightly said yourself, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, is for us to avoid procyclical policies in Europe, in both the expansionist and restrictive senses. However, we can only do that if we can compare cyclically neutral budget data with structural deficits in updated budget figures. I think that it would be helpful if the excitement that this debate has generated in this House led to further progress being made both in economic policy and in stability policy. I say that because the European Union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability.
Randzio-Plath (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the challenges of globalisation make it clear to us just how important coordination of economic policies is for Europe, and also the integration of financial, employment and social policies, because little Europe is demonstrating to the world that it is possible to make progress in a region if regional cooperation does not just mean intergovernmental cooperation and is not just a free trade area. I believe that the combination of the single market on the one hand and certain possibilities for giving political direction on the other is what makes the European Union what it is. I therefore very much welcome the Commission communication and Mrs Berès's report, as they make it very clear that we need to make further progress with the coordination process. We all know that the challenges and demands on us are now even greater than ever. ECOFIN has quite rightly made sure that more integrated approaches are now being adopted, especially in the field of capital movements. It is certainly important that we should not just act in unison and improve the quality of coordination, but that we should also agree on guidelines. Fortunately, the Lisbon process, which was taken further in Stockholm, has given us both quantitative and qualitative objectives. Of course these still need to be extended and refined, but it enables us to demonstrate to the public that the coordination process can lead to positive outcomes. If you could not say that, who would be interested in checking if all the Member States have actually met the requirements to which they have committed themselves? One aspect of the commitments that they have entered into is the consolidation of their budgets. Mr Bullmann was quite right to point out the progress made in this area. It is certainly true that there is still more to be done in reducing debt in some Member States, but we should not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact exists as an instrument to prevent us ever exceeding a deficit of 3% of GNP. That is at the heart of the convergence criteria and this deficit is intended to help us to achieve a favourable monetary policy that promotes development. I believe that coordination can be enhanced still further, and that all those policies which can mutually or reciprocally support each other should be brought into this coordination process. I also think that it is a particularly good thing that the European Parliament can call on the national parliaments to take part in the coordination process and I really wish to emphasise that point. We, as a committee, have attempted to constantly highlight this cooperation with national parliaments. Mr President, I would like to make one final comment. We should not see the coordination of policies as an end in itself. We, in Europe, have missed out on growth because over the last few decades coordination has been lacking. We lost out because we did not adopt a coordinated approach to the UMTS auction. We could have achieved a totally different outcome. Nor did we react jointly when the OPEC countries raised oil prices. There is no doubt that we could have achieved a more favourable starting point for economic development if we had acted in a more coordinated way.

 Mr President, Mr Prodi, the White Paper calls on Parliament to enhance its role in feeding the views of its electors into the political debate. But this means, Mr Prodi, and I must stress this point, that in the twenty-first century democracy will continue to be associated with the word ‘parliamentary’ and not with the word ‘consultative’. (Applause)
 We do not want to go back to the pre-parliamentary democracy era and the White Paper should not be associated with that idea. Framework legislation and the use of other regulatory mechanisms can only be something positive if they are linked with appropriate guarantees. In the case of framework legislation the effect of these guarantees should be to ensure that the power to define is not handed over to some agency or other, but is reserved to Parliament. It is not only Parliament's privilege to insist on this, it is Parliament's duty. You say that you want more transparency and consultation, but whom are you excluding and whom are you including? Associations and non-governmental organisations that can pay for expertise will be better off than those who do not have these resources. And in practice some people will surely be better able to make their voice heard than others. Will this not mean that we are making the playing field for the various parts of civil society in the European Union still more uneven? I believe in a level playing field for the various actors and institutions. I believe that the White Paper is not clear enough about this. I call on you to make this clear, because I have to say that when it comes to financial market legislation, the implementation of the Commission's financial action plan tends to give one co-legislator a stronger position than the other co-legislator, the European Parliament. That does not seem a very promising road to go down. This imbalance needs to be rectified, and at the next intergovernmental conference Article 202 of course needs to be amended by creating a call-back right. However, the Commission could also demonstrate its good will at this stage and make it clear that it does not intend to surreptitiously change the balance between the institutions. We, as a parliament, owe that much to society, because parliamentary activity does not just mean controlling things, but also shaping them. I do not want to leave that task to a variety of committees chaired by people without any democratic legitimacy and who are not co-elected by Parliament, as is the case in the United States for example. (Applause)

Madam President, G8 summits are in fact an attempt to find global political answers to the globalisation of the markets, which is now a fact of life. We need these political answers. What would make me very happy, however, would be if we could take stock of the G8 summits and find out if their agreements had brought in any results. I need only quote the very specific problem of children in armed conflicts and protection for these children to illustrate that, unfortunately, we have not made much headway at all here, despite the fact that the G8 has already passed an agreement on this subject. Apart from the very important question of how we can help the poorest developing countries, the question of an improved world trade order as a means of improving the situation in the developing countries is also quite rightly on the agenda. I would also like to see the G8 summit express a desire to create an international competitive order within the world trade order, and not just confined to specific regions of the world. This is all the more important now that a summit issue which has never yet been on the agenda, is also set to become the subject of discussion and consultation, namely the gloomy prospects for growth in the world economy. I really hope that the optimism of the Heads of Government at the summit will help to kick start the economy again because we are in dire need of sustainable growth both in the USA and in other regions of the world; even Europe is not immune to developments in other regions of the world. In this context I should like to call once again for the Heads of State and Government to put the subject of a new financial architecture on the agenda. We need financial stability on the markets. If there is no financial stability on the markets, this adversely affects the world economy and our own economies. The Heads of State and Government also need to express a desire and call for the private sector to be involved in managing crises on the financial markets. I really cannot stress enough that stability on the financial markets is a public asset which is most definitely in the common good. (Applause)

 Mr President, the Belgian presidency’s ambitious programme for this presidency gives us hope that it is possible to combine tangible, solid steps on the way to an even more successful future for Europe with vision. You see, I actually believe that the public not only expect practical solutions, but also want to know where we are heading in the European Union. This will also become apparent in the case of economic policy. Here too, Mr President-in-Office, we need more democracy and transparency, and I would be pleased if the Belgian presidency were also to take on board the proposals which the European Parliament has already developed. It is in economic policy in particular that we see that, on the basis of the Lisbon and Stockholm conclusions, further progress needs to be made so that we can also actually bring about growth based on effective employment. At a time when one negative prognosis about the development of the European Union follows hot on the heels of another, it is important for the Belgian presidency to try, with a steady hand, to set priorities so that we can actually successfully achieve our ambitious goal of bundling and coordinating policies in the fields of the economy, employment and social affairs. There is still a lot of catching up to do here, and coordination must not only be a word; it must also be reflected in the bundling of policies and in the creation of greater transparency so that steps of this kind are also taken in tandem across the Member States. The same applies to fiscal policy, Mr President, because here we have unfair competition within the European Union. I am counting on the Belgian presidency here. In conclusion, I should like to make one further point: yours is a twofold presidency and you also have the task of leading the eurozone in the run-up to 1 January 2002. We all know that there is still a lack of information and a lack of acceptance. I call on the Belgian presidency, together with its colleagues, to make the introduction of the euro really a top-level issue so that we not only have brochures being distributed but also confidence-building measures being initiated by your side, so that as the euro moves from being a virtual currency union to being a reality it is accompanied by confidence and credibility.

 Mr President, you have made it clear that all the partners in the European single currency and also in the European Union need to pool their efforts if the historical event of completing the currency union of the 12 is to be achieved, and I can assure you that you have the support of the European Parliament. The European Central Bank is a very young institution. The euro, for which it is responsible, is not yet even a truly tangible currency. That is why it is so important for the ECB to establish its own credibility. That means that the ECB's mandate needs to be very clearly expressed through its monetary strategy. So far, the ECB has been fairly successful: even commentators who are usually very critical of the ECB's monetary policy are increasingly and quite rightly recognising that Europe needs a specific solution in monetary policy terms and that asset prices should not be the main parameter for monetary policy decision making. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of coherence in justifying individual policy measures. They may well be correct technically speaking, but purely technical explanations are not enough to convince Europe's markets and its public once again that the ECB is committed to price stability and to build up public confidence in the euro, which has unfortunately not improved since it was introduced. Against this background, the European Parliament's demand for immediate publication of the arguments for a decision or otherwise, together with the counter-arguments and the underlying reasons, and also of the summary minutes, could facilitate greater understanding of the ECB. Max Weber once spoke about the three sources of authority: tradition, charisma and reason. The ECB should develop the form of authority that Weber considered modern – rational authority – as a means of achieving lasting respect and efficiency. Rational authority depends on a reliable assessment of the facts. Forming a judgment in this way provides a basis for a sensible public debate on the issues surrounding European monetary policy. This is essential if one considers that monetary policy is now, more than ever before, effective above all through the channel of the expectations of the financial markets, which have a considerable influence on the behaviour of the economic players. Without a lever of this kind a central bank can fail to achieve its objectives. Accountability and transparency do not mean that the ECB should publish more and more material. Quality is more important than quantity, and in this respect I would like to specifically acknowledge the quality of the monetary dialogue with the European Parliament. The ECB has improved the transparency of its monetary policy decision making. Nevertheless, more openness and transparency cannot do any harm, indeed in the coming months they should increase confidence in and acceptance of the single currency. The single European currency depends on this, and the following measures would be helpful: First, the definition of the secondary target of monetary policy in accordance with Article 105 should be set and published in order to make it clear when the ECB can and must support growth and employment in the euro area, and that the ECB also supports conditions for sustainable growth effective in terms of employment at the highest level, as it did at the EU Summit in Lisbon with its target of 3% growth. Second, it would be helpful in this respect to publish the models used. As long as the European Central Bank does not opt for an inflation target, it should stick to the two-pillar approach, but it should continuously improve its calculation of M3 by increased analysis and research activity. An analytically disciplined extension of the second pillar is also needed. Third, the ECB's forecasts must be more precise and should not be broad ranges as they have up to now; these need to be narrowed. They should also be issued four times a year. In order to achieve greater understanding and transparency, the ECB should adopt the forecasts produced by its own staff. Fourth, summary minutes should be published containing the arguments made for and against when making decisions on monetary policy, together with an anonymous account of the voting pattern. Fifth, we need to establish whether, as part of the revision of the Treaty, Parliament should not be given a kind of right of confirmation in respect of nomination of members of the Executive Board. Sixth, as an important partner in macroeconomic decision making, the ECB should make its contribution to improving the coordination of economic policies and the generation of an appropriate and balanced policy mix, just as other independent central banks do, without diminishing its independence in the process. The ECB's priority target of guaranteeing price stability is not, after all, an objective in its own right, but rather a key condition for economic growth and job creation. That is why monetary policy should not be formulated in isolation but rather supplemented by still closer macroeconomic policy coordination in the euro area. The situation still leaves a lot to be desired in this area. This could prevent economic integration being driven solely by the markets without any account being taken of employment policy and social issues. Another reason for enhanced macroeconomic coordination involving the European Central Bank is the accelerating globalisation of financial markets, which less and less reflects the turnover of goods and services. This suggests that interest rate variations will have a greater influence on the price of financial assets, while their effect on the real economy has become weaker than it used to be. Concerns about the independence of the European Central Bank which have been raised as regards the effectiveness of its participation in the macroeconomic policy dialogue are equally difficult to understand. Quite the opposite: I believe that enhanced coordination would not endanger but reinforce the independence of the European Central Bank. A higher degree of economic convergence would also facilitate its task as it would even alleviate the problem of a "one size fits all" monetary policy, and therefore reduce the risk of putting the ECB under political pressure. The European Central Bank's position is not the same as that of the US Federal Reserve Bank. Its stakeholders are not just one President, one finance minister and the public, its stakeholders are 12 presidents, 12 finance ministers and the public of twelve European countries, who do not always speak with one voice. As the representative of the European public, the European Parliament would like to be a genuine partner in this dialogue regarding the creation of a new political culture in the European Union, which, on the one hand, guarantees the independence of the institutions but which, on the other hand, also takes account of the responsibility of each institution to be transparent and accountable in the interest of a properly functioning democracy.

 Mr President, both of these regions of the world, the European Union – or Europe – and Asia have opened up channels between each other and moved closer together. As sensational as the first ASEM Summit was, relations in very many areas are in fact now perceived as normal. It is particularly when I think of cultural relations and of the very fruitful work of the Asia-Europe Foundation in Singapore that I sometimes realise that there are more encounters involving schools, students, scientists and also managers than involving politicians. That is why I should like to recall once more here that this European Parliament once said – and on one occasion it also made this a reality – that in the same way that there was a summit between governments there should be a summit between parliaments. I believe that it is absolutely essential for contacts between parliaments in Europe and Asia to be intensified and that, before the next ASEM Summit in Copenhagen at the latest, we should put in place a stringent process to monitor these important joint political initiatives, even if some of them are based on conflicting principles. I really believe that this is essential because both regions are playing an important part in reforming the United Nations and also the World Trade Organisation. It is also in both regions' interests for progress to be made on security for their people and mankind in general. I am thinking here both of food safety and the fight against organised crime. There really is no limit to the forms which cooperation might take here, and in this respect Europe really needs to move forward. We are fortunate to have been able to initiate a process of reflection on security policy in ASEAN and throughout the Asian area. A further matter which is of concern to me is that we should help to combat trafficking in human beings. We are now faced with a situation where millions of people have been abducted, and they are no longer only women and children but also men. I think that both regions of the world have a responsibility here to put an end to this form of freedom of movement on this earth. (Applause)

Mr President, I too believe that a socially committed market economy with sound environmental credentials is a good model on which to base the economic policy of the European Union, provided it can continue what the Lisbon process set in motion, namely the integration of economic, employment, social and financial policies, thereby paving the way for the development of a genuinely sustainable strategy and for the implementation at long last of a balanced and appropriate policy mix in the European Union. Sadly, the broad economic policy guidelines still contain too little in the way of qualitative and quantitative targets that could inspire us to think beyond the narrow confines of tax cuts and spending cuts. I believe that a new debate on the quality of public finances in all Member States, which the Commission has gratifyingly initiated, can enable us to move more freely along the road to a form of investment-led growth that will create employment. That is essential too. In my opinion, the broad economic policy guidelines must focus more sharply than hitherto on investment-led growth and on motivating people to enhance their employability. At the moment we are confronted by a certain degree of pessimism in the European Union. I do not believe that a sustained slide towards recession is threatening, but every possible step must be taken to ensure that the recent developments in the United States do not become such a risk to the European economy that the European Union is powerless to contain it. I should like to emphasise that the broad economic policy guidelines, the aims of our economic policy, do not apply to the euro zone alone but to the entire single European market, the home market of the European Union, and that is how it should stay, because what we do not want to let ourselves be split in two but rather to go on growing closer together. We in Europe, however, must not slide into another recession for want of initiative, into a slump that destroys what we have achieved, namely the lowest level of unemployment for ten years. Let me therefore re-emphasise that, compared with other regions of the world, we invest too little in research and development and in education and training, and even in the realm of infrastructural investments, which this House has so often commended and demanded, we are still lagging behind. Besides monetary stability and sound budgetary policies, it is also imperative that we find innovative ways of achieving social stability and a stable employment situation. This is what the Lisbon process requires of us. I regret that we have not seen even more new ideas emerging during the Swedish Presidency of the Council. But I also bitterly regret that we do not have more transparency and democracy. The participation of the European Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, in the formulation and adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines and in the preparation of other processes connected with Lisbon and Stockholm is indispensable. If need be, we must use the next intergovernmental conference in 2004 to lend weight to our demands.

Mr President, my Group backs the rapporteur, who has clearly illustrated that the convergence and stability programmes are extremely valuable when it comes to forging real economic policy in the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular which is a matter of common interest. We see the outlines of economic policy on the one hand, but we see the stability and convergence programmes on the other. I should also like to remind the House in this context that the Stability and Growth Pact has predominantly been geared in the past towards achieving stability. It did, however, always include growth factors. From this point of view, the rapporteur’s approach is the right one, indicating as it does that it makes sense to use investments, both private and public, in order to achieve a real knowledge-based society of the future in the European Union. If these public-sector investments are used for the benefit of information technologies, other new technologies and a better, modernised infrastructure in the euro zone and the European Union, then this is the right way forward. From this point of view it is also very important that we restart the debate on the quality of public finances. Luckily, the Commission has presented a paper here which will need to play an important part in future discussions in connection with stability and convergence programmes. Because we must ensure when evaluating the state of public finances, which is also our job, when analysing the content of the convergence and stability programmes, that we identify the right trend, that we identify the right development, but that we do not lose sight during our discussions of the possibility of steering in the opposite direction. Mr von Wogau, you referred to possible dangers. You pointed out that advice in the Bible on lean and fat years should still be seen as relevant by financial policy-makers in the European Union. Any analysis of public finances, however, must also consider what impact expenditure may have on monetary policy. We therefore need to work with sound public finances in the euro zone because a poor financial situation could jeopardise monetary stability. Windfalls have not been spent on consumption as in past years; they have also been used to reduce debt and for investments. We must also consider how this sort of economic policy coordination can be used to guarantee social and employment policy as well as monetary stability. Here too there is both an obligation and a challenge for the countries in the euro zone, the pre-ins and future candidate countries alike.

Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Parliament welcomes the onset of spring at the Stockholm Summit. Because one thing is clear: the spring summit will become standard practice in the future, so that we not only bank on a future-orientated, knowledge-based society, but can also actually live in it. We need the ambitious strategy of change decided in Lisbon. We need to make it tighter and more dynamic and Stockholm has added another brick to this edifice. And rightly so, given the jitters in the world economy, the shadow being cast over growth in the European economy and the crashes on the stock exchanges. The successes of the year 2000, with record growth, healthy finances, the lowest inflation and interest rates and 2.5 million new jobs, should not be underestimated. They say something about the need to continue the process of open coordination and link economic, employment and social policies. We must hold on to this, otherwise there will be no further progress. We must also anchor this in specific basic aspects of economic policy for the year 2001. We must be able to go on reaping benefits here, even if Europe has to overcome other weaknesses, such as excessively low, interrupted growth, unacceptable unemployment and the exclusion of too many people. The European summit is rightly interested in economic reform, properly functioning markets and regulation, where having qualitative yardsticks is in people’s interests. We must therefore welcome the fact that the summit was not just a liberalisation and deregulation summit but that, at the same time, it is banking on pan-European regulation, where such regulation is needed in the interest of universal services, fair distribution and consumer protection. Even the promotion of entrepreneurial initiative, with special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises and the venture capital and start-up finance which is vital to them, is in its infancy. And the EU summit rightly took account of the importance of research, innovation and new technologies in creating jobs and prosperity. In this context, we must clearly recognise that the analysis and use of public funding and the quality of such funding – including state aid – must be assessed more closely for its impact on employment. I think we need to invest still more in people and better quality jobs. And a further change of tack from a passive to an active employment policy, over and above the previous objectives of the European employment strategy, is still on the agenda. Mr President-in-Office, the presidency is promising more democracy and transparency in economic policy. But where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets? The European Parliament wants speed and flexibility in the legislative area – just as you do – and welcomes the Lamfalussy report. But we insist on full transparency and proper symmetry between the institutions in the codecision procedure. We here in the European Parliament want the rights which the Council already enjoys. Help us to secure them. You too, Mr President of the Commission, can help to make this possible. Just one more thing: we also want more democracy and a real partnership when the economic policy guidelines are decided. Both the Commission and the Council really can help in this regard and I call on them to do so. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have two brief questions. Firstly, 9 May is also supposed to convince young people in the European Union that their future lies in Euroland. What are you doing, what is the Commission doing, and what are you arranging with the Member States so that a Euro project day takes place in every school before the end of this year? Do you plan to launch a specific initiative here? Secondly,what measures can be taken to help boost consumer confidence and ensure that in terms of consumer protection, there are no grounds to fear price distortions during conversion and a lack of transparency in price calculation? Thirdly, do you intend to continue the Euro information campaign with the Member States at least during the first half of next year, and if so, in what form?
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is currently working on one of the important subjects on the European agenda, which was also one of the focal points of the discussions at the Stockholm European Council, namely the issue of demographic change, combined with comprehensive social protection, and other issues related to pension schemes within the European Union. At the moment, we have on the table the Commission proposal on supplementary occupational retirement provision. This is certainly – in particular from the point of view of European integration – a very important proposal, which should complement the statutory pension scheme and, together with a private pension, form, as it were, a three-pillar basis for secure retirement provision in the European Union. The second pillar, the supplementary occupational pension, will certainly play an increasingly important role in the Member States of the European Union. One reason for this is, of course, that, owing to demographic change, State security systems are experiencing financing problems, but it is primarily because we wish to have pensions which will provide for a secure future. In this context it should be noted that the Commission has not yet submitted a proposal for a directive to Parliament which covers the whole package necessary for an occupational pension, as it promised it would last year, but only one part of it. The European Commission's proposal for a directive contains no reference to tax arrangements. For us it is very important to know to what extent the existing regulations are to be supplemented by proposals to harmonise taxes or proposals for new taxation arrangements. Commissioner, you have announced that a communication will soon be published. In order to actually give our opinion on the overall package, it is very important for us to know to what extent the principle of the free movement of workers might not be undermined by diverging national taxation, by different taxation of contributions, including to occupational pension schemes, and by different taxation of pensions themselves, because we do have downstream taxation in many Member States. All of these questions remain open and are closely bound up with the success of the proposal for a directive which you have tabled. I have one further comment: it is unacceptable for workers to be discriminated against solely on the basis of the place where they then draw this pension. Neither tax avoidance, nor unfair tax competition, nor insufficient exchange of information on tax are responsible for this problem. What we actually need here is coordination of tax policies, the initial moves towards which looked so promising with the Monti package. It is also in the interests of workers who wish to engage in cross-border activities – and the Treaty provides for this – that we need to make this possible. That is why for us in the European Parliament it is terribly important that we also receive answers from you, before we complete our discussions, on how tax coordination is to be guaranteed in this sector.
Randzio-Plath (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Commissioner, I should like to ask one more question because we have had repeated problems with the timing of events: when exactly will the communication reach us? The second point which is unclear is: how is a communication supposed to help to actually determine the basic taxation rules for the whole directive if you are not able to tell us the principles according to which a minimum of harmonisation, while avoiding tax discrimination or non-collection, will have to be regulated? Even if you leave this to the Member States a contradiction still remains, namely: how can further progress be made and what then is the significance of the directive?
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs showed its appreciation of the report of the Committee of Wise Men by adopting a unanimous resolution. It is in the interests of the European Union, in the interests of the three institutions, to do something about the fragmentation of the European financial markets and find solutions which take account of the interests of industry, investors and end-users and which, in this age of globalisation, help to stabilise the financial markets. We therefore feel that quicker, more efficient legislation needs to be passed in this area. All three institutions have a contribution to make here. The Wise Men’s report does not clarify how the players and institutions should interact at the various levels and therefore calls for dialogue between the European institutions, hence our questions to the Commission and the Council, because the European Parliament is not sure how the institutional balance can be guaranteed in the European Union within this sort of proposal. We have formulated our proposals on this basis and we expect replies from the Council and the Commission. Indeed, unlike in most Member States or the USA, the Treaty makes no provision for secondary legislation, not least because there is no executive body at Community level to which such powers can be delegated. And, unlike national parliaments, the European Parliament has no right of initiative. The comitology procedure proposed by the Council and in the report will certainly need to be supplemented, in order to establish a balance between the institutions, if there is to be a fast-track procedure. This means that, if a clear correlation between political and technical matters is created within framework legislation, technical implementing powers and powers to adapt to technological progress will need to be decided as quickly as possible and backed up by giving the European Parliament a clear callback right if anyone acts ultra vires 
or fails to abide by the transparency rule, for example, during the consultation process. Finally, the Lamfalussy report, like the European Parliament, attaches great importance to an absolutely transparent procedure in precisely this legislative area. I should like to say that, with good will on the part of the Council and the Commission, this callback right could be included by simply amending the 1999 comitology decision to include the eventuality that, if the European Parliament feels that the Securities Committee has acted ultra vires
, 
this must be rectified either by the Commission’s submitting a new proposal or by applying the normal codecision procedure in this area. The European Parliament is calling quite unequivocally for an interinstitutional agreement here which clarifies the fact that the basic principles and the clear distinction between political and technical implementing measures are regulated in the laws on a case-by-case basis. We are prepared to go along with anything which speeds things up – we can also apply the fast track procedure to the parliamentary codecision procedure – and to guarantee that there is total transparency. But I call on the Council and the Commission to give us a clear answer here today as to what plans they have for a callback right for the European Parliament or equivalent procedure because this is crucial to our democratic responsibility in the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have referred to numerous possibilities and impossibilities. As rapporteur and committee chair, I should like to revert to the question which you did not answer and which is of crucial importance to our committee. I refer to the callback right. No one wants to change the Treaty just now. The point is, can we find a solution within the framework of the 1999 comitology decision? Why not supplement Article 6 and give Parliament a guarantee which secures its callback right, Commissioner, if the Commission or the other institutions do not act as the European Parliament would wish? I think that this would show willing on the part of the institutions and would prove that we live in a European democracy.

 Mr President, I would like to withdraw everything but the first 29 words of Amendment No 33, so that we are only voting on the first 29 words. The rapporteur was made aware of this beforehand.

Mr President, the new European strategy which came out of Lisbon for a competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based Europe stood the test of time in the year 2000 and so, with the help of the synthesis report and the resolutions adopted at Stockholm, it must be further consolidated within the main thrusts of economic policy, which must be more binding this year than they have been in previous years. Unemployment has finally fallen, even though the still high level of unemployment is deplorable. Nevertheless, 2.6 million new jobs have been created and the positive economic trends have been confirmed by good economic data, even though the pace has slowed down. The strategic approach of giving equal status to the policy areas of economic reform, economic growth, full employment and social inclusion has proved its worth. But it must be consolidated and implemented. The US economic climate, however, is keeping Europe on tenterhooks. But a soft landing does seem possible. Nevertheless, Europe must be prepared for lower demand for its exports. For that reason, there is no alternative but to introduce structural reforms in the goods, services, capital and labour markets, which must lead to increased output potential and productivity. Mr Friedrich, extended codecision can even lead to higher motivation among the workforce and thus to increased productivity. (Applause)
 The European Union has made great strides in terms of structural reforms, which is underlined by the most recent progress report of the International Monetary Fund on the euro zone. This is also true for information and communications technologies and for the labour markets. At the same time a policy mix must be developed which will help compensate for the effects of a possibly negative impact on the EU internal market from reduced US demand, by increasing domestic demand. The Bullmann report and the synthesis report, with its ten correctly identified fields of action, rightly emphasise that the future of Europe lies in the ability of Member States to reform themselves, in the qualifications offensive aimed at increasing employment, in the modernisation of infrastructures, the expansion of the information society and in overcoming poverty and social exclusion. To this end, the instruments of privatisation and deregulation must be exploited to the full. But new instruments must only be used where restructuring and, hence, regulation are needed. Especially important is a clear regulatory framework in all areas, most notably for financial services, which have a high priority for increased investment activity, which is crucial in the EU. This is in the interest of the European model of a social market economy. It is also important that the open coordination process method is taken a step further. In this connection, a timetable, together with qualitative and quantitative objects, as well as intermediate goals, are needed. This proved to be crucial with the advent of the internal market and the introduction of economic and monetary union. In this case too, it must lead to the streamlining of the domestic market in the interest of the economy and employment. To this end, the European Parliament needs to play an enhanced role and be more involved in the process of coordinating economic policy. The Swedish Presidency has called for democracy and transparency in this area. I hope they are as good as their word.
Randzio-Plath (PSE

, Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – (DE)
 Madam President, as committee Chair I do not simply wish to point out that we actually have a report which enables us to carry out a careful analysis of the stability and convergence programmes; this work is not only very substantial but also needs to be done very conscientiously, because what is really at stake is whether we as Member States of the European Union adhere to the Maastricht criteria, both before joining the single currency and, above all, after doing so, as there are already 12 Member States in the eurozone now. This is an extremely demanding process, which really calls for very careful political judgment. That is why, Mr Poettering, we do indeed need to have all the information, but the information that we receive is chiefly contained in written reports, and I believe that this House would be well advised to entrust this work to the relevant specialist committee in the first place. I would like to recall the difficulties we had in agreeing the Stability and Growth Pact here at all, and that there was a big question mark hanging over whether investment in education should be added to the budget deficit. At that point, this was questioned not only by Members of the PSE Group, but also by Members of the PPE-DE Group. That is why I really urge that we should on no account hold a debate, which will happen of necessity if the question remains on the agenda, but that this should instead be done in committee. Mr Solbes can help us in the committee, we can deliberate on this matter and that will allow us to reach a balanced and appropriate decision in the plenary session on the basis of the report by our rapporteur.

 Mr President, I want to thank the Presidency of the Council for taking such a positive approach to the Stockholm summit and aiming at economic sustainability, which lies in the interests of full employment, economic reform, innovation and the future viability of the European Union. What we need in Stockholm is not a deregulation summit. We need a summit that makes it clear at what European Union level we can regulate everything best, so that we really can make progress in using the single market in the interests not just of the economy but also of the people, of the workers. So I would like to make a request to the Swedish Presidency. If you want to show greater transparency and greater democracy, specifically in relation to coordinating economic policy, make a start by involving the European Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, in every initiative and in elaborating the basic features of economic policy. We will first submit our proposals in the framework of a legislative procedure. We will see whether the Swedish Presidency really is taking this issue of overcoming the democratic deficit on board and is proceeding pragmatically, by small steps. That is a very cordial request by the European Parliament, which has been calling since 1994 for an interinstitutional agreement of that kind to be reached. I would ask the presidency to pursue the Lisbon process consistently, ensuring that all policy areas referred to in it keep the same status. That means we really do implement an appropriate and adequate policy mix, by pursuing a policy of social integration, full employment and economic reforms based on clear timetables together with quality benchmarks. The same applies to financial policy, for we must begin by making it clear through our investment policy that the people of Europe can achieve added value through cooperation at European level, through investment in people, but also in infrastructures. Let me address one last comment to the Swedish Presidency: we place our hopes in you to ensure that the citizens of Europe, most of whom are very worried, can face the introduction of the euro without fear. Please work very closely with the Belgian Presidency and call on all the players in the villages, towns and capitals to cooperate. For the euro is a bold historic project that can only succeed if we all pull together. (Applause)

Madam President, if I may crave your indulgence, I only wished to comment that the draft Treaty of Nice regrettably still makes reference to the ecu rather than the euro. I believe this is something of an anachronism! (Laughter)
Randzio-Plath (PSE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, the progress that was made in the domain of European fiscal policy at the EU Summit in Nice was totally unsatisfactory. Indeed, the position of fiscal sovereignty as symbol of national sovereignty seems to have been further strengthened by the introduction of the euro. Yet we are all aware now that unfettered fiscal competition is detrimental to every one of us. By offering short-term location incentives, a government damages the economies of neighbouring Member States. The idea of a European fiscal policy is not about levying Community taxes or harmonising tax regimes. It is about the coordination of taxes with a view to avoiding fiscal competition and establishing legal certainty, transparency and efficiency. This makes the siege mentality that prevailed in Nice all the more regrettable. EU fiscal policy remains governed by the consensus principle. This has to change if the single market is to function smoothly. We are already familiar with the problems in the domains of VAT and energy taxes. It will soon become apparent that the European capital market also requires coordination and harmonisation if the financial action plan is to stand even the slightest chance of being implemented. Let me now turn to the three proposals from the Commission and its communication. My group endorses the rapporteurs' conclusions. It is extremely regrettable that a framework directive on the taxation of energy products has not been adopted to this day. Perhaps, as a first step, agreement should be reached on a sort of code of conduct to encourage the use of fiscal instruments in the cause of energy saving and environmental protection. Positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be abolished. This, however, presupposes an international regime – and I entirely agree with the rapporteur here – otherwise it would unduly impair the competitiveness of the European airlines. Consequently, it would be very fitting indeed if the Commission were to present us with reports which included analyses of the relationship between taxation on the one hand and actual energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions on the other. Secondly, with regard to the period of applicability of the minimum standard rate, it is sadly obvious that we still await any sign of progress towards a definitive VAT system based on the country of origin, despite the euro having brought price transparency to the internal market. So we have no option but to welcome the Commission's attempt to introduce a wide range of new rules in order to improve the present system, which is too complex, bureaucratic, and open to evasion. Members of the European Parliament have never been able to understand why governments are prepared to go on tolerating the leakage of billions of euros in tax revenue under the current system. It is high time the Commission gathered the various VAT directives into a single regulation so that the VAT regime can at least be uniformly applied. That has to be said here. There is always a chance, of course, that we might yet receive a Christmas present. As far as the VAT arrangements applicable to certain services supplied by electronic means are concerned, the Commission proposal and the rapporteur merit our support. It is unacceptable that European companies should be at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-EU companies in the realm of e-commerce because they are liable for VAT in respect of their transactions in the world at large as well as those within the internal market. It is also important that e-commerce is not subject to heavier or lighter taxation than conventional business transactions. Registration in a single country is the appropriate, simple and efficient way to achieve this aim. However, on account of the wide range of VAT rates, it will be necessary, as our rapporteur rightly proposes, to distribute VAT revenue fairly among the Member States by means of a clearing system.

 Madam President, the rapporteur's report is very much to be welcomed because it highlights the problems associated with cross-border payments. After all, we expect credit transfers to strengthen economic integration in the European Union and not to throw a spanner in the works. That is what they are doing to this day, as we can see from the many complaints made by small and medium-sized businesses and the complaints made by the public about the high charges for transferring small amounts, which are quite simply very much in evidence. We even know of cases in which transfer fees for cross-border payments increased when the euro was introduced, and not only by a modest amount. The monthly cheque to a daughter or son in another EU country, the cross-border transfers for books or services, hotels or trips are being subjected to additional charges, despite the fact that the logistics of cross-border trade are supposed to be less complex and less expensive. There is even talk of it being possible to reduce costs by 90%, although the financial services institutions impress on us time and again that the higher costs are linked to processing the transfers and not to the technicalities of making cross-border payments. Nevertheless, it would have been good if a TARGET system for small payments and retail payments had been introduced at the same time as the TARGET system for wholesale payments, because technically that would have been possible; it is just that there was not the same determination to do so as there was for wholesale payments. In the European Parliament in our work in committee, we also very much regretted the fact that the offer made by the European Central Bank was not accepted. Here, too, we endorse the statement made by the European Central Bank that one day it should not be any more expensive to effect a cross-border transfer to another EU country than to transfer money within one single EU country. For years we have been pressing for the efforts being made to be harmonised. After all, it is in fact very possible to set up a quick, secure and cheap system, and fortunately the financial services institutions have now also come on board; they are on the right track. But it would have been good if we had already made use of the transitional period. The many complaints made by incensed members of the public speak for themselves, and I have to say that particularly at this time these are, of course, not likely to increase public acceptance of monetary union. The political objective is clear and is supported by the European Central Bank: what we need is a European payment area within which everything works just as smoothly as it does in a single EU country. Small customers are just as much part of the internal market as major customers; there should be no discrimination here. I believe, however, that there is also more that the governments must do, and I support the rapporteur's report. At the same time, the reporting requirement for balance of payment statistics should be abolished for small-value cross-border payments for amounts of less than EUR 50 000. Samples are actually sufficient. The European Central Bank could help by creating a single European data format for credit transfers and by supporting moves to create a uniform European bank sort code within the international IBAN system. It is important for all those involved to do what the European Central Bank is obliged to do as one of its tasks laid down in the Treaty, namely to promote the smooth operation of payment systems. The European Commission does not have the right to set the level of bank charges, but it can use its influence to bring down transfer fees. In the Union, charges sometimes vary very considerably, but sometimes they are also very similar. They therefore play a part in restricting freedom of movement in the internal market. I think that the Commission needs to be much quicker than it has been up until now about finally tabling the results of its investigations into whether there are, in fact, restrictive agreements between the banks. What is becoming important – and the report rightly refers to this – is consumer preference for electronic payments, and here we call for progress to be made so that here too an interoperable multi-currency standard for electronic purses can actually be introduced. This initiative, which so far is operational in Luxembourg, France and Germany, needs to be extended to the rest of the EU. I believe that this report is of central importance if we are truly to succeed in integrating the public and small and medium-sized businesses into the euro area and for increasing public acceptance of economic and monetary union. We need security, speed and also low costs. Living in the monetary union also means counting on a reliable cross-border credit transfer system – this is the battle cry for the remaining 432 days.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is certainly to be welcomed that account was taken in Biarritz of the need for coordination in the sphere of energy policy, which is of such crucial importance to citizens, the economy, growth and prosperity. There is really no point in Member States going it alone in this respect; the fact that the Community is totally dependent on energy says it all. The package of measures proposed by the Commission with a view to increasing energy efficiency and saving energy, is therefore constructive, and likewise the investigations into cartel problems with the oil companies. It is not just the cartel of oil-producing countries we should be concentrating on though, but also that of the oil companies. We wish the French Council Presidency every success at the negotiations in Riyadh, on which occasion, as I see it, these States would do well to ensure that oil prices do not rocket any higher, if only for reasons of self-interest. Setbacks in economic growth within the European Union have repercussions for the global economy. We should also take a look at our own situation, however. It is important to take a step forward on the European energy taxation front, such progress having been blocked hitherto by the unanimity principle. With that in mind, Parliament is expecting the Nice Summit to take a step in the direction of qualified majority voting in those areas where taxation policy is disrupting the proper functioning of the internal market. Biarritz did not manage to dispel all the storm clouds attending our mission to promote the democratisation of the European Union. The Council Presidency wants to abolish the cooperation procedure and replace it with the consultation procedure. This procedure is unacceptable from a democratic and integrationist perspective. Nor is it to be tolerated with regard to Economic and Monetary Union; on the contrary! This is precisely where we must advance the cause of the codecision procedure. If the project is not yet viable, then we urge the French Council Presidency to seek progressive institutional reforms and measures which will enable Parliament to participate. At the very least, it must be possible to agree on the detail of a common position on these matters in Nice. But we say ‘no’ to replacing the cooperation procedure with the consultation procedure. That would be a retrograde step. That is why action is called for!

 Mr President, the rapporteur and all the other Members who have spoken in this Chamber have quite rightly stressed that more efficient risk capital markets have an important role to play in supporting economic growth, creating new and long-lasting jobs and promoting a European knowledge society. This of course also applies to encouraging SMEs and promoting entrepreneurialism. These are objectives that are repeatedly highlighted as being cornerstones, not only of our economic policy guidelines, but also of our employment policy guidelines. The proposed implementation of the action plan is the right way to go and is part of the structural reforms still needed in Europe despite all the progress made in implementing structural reforms in the markets for products, capital and services. But there is more to be done here. It is a good thing that this clearly emerged at both the Lisbon Summit and the employment forum. Above all it has also become apparent that the European Investment Bank will play an additional positive role. Mr Skinner was right to draw attention to that. Furthermore, the Commission communication also indicates, and this was also quite rightly taken on board in the report, that we have still not made sufficient progress in building an integrated pan-European risk capital market, and that this is a weak area for the EU. The figures speak for themselves. Risk capital investment in Europe has more than doubled over the last four years, but only EUR 7 billion was invested in Europe, compared with EUR 12 billion in the USA. If we compare investment during the start-up period of companies, the picture is even clearer, with EUR 1.6 billion in Europe against EUR 4.5 billion in the USA. Europe's equity markets for high-growth companies may have grown significantly, but in comparison with the US NASDAQ we are just dwarfs. We are all aware of the problems involved, but we are faced with obstacles that seriously stand in the way of our taking a risk-based and entrepreneurial approach. I have in mind not only cultural barriers, but also red tape, approval and licensing procedures, difficulties for SMEs in simply filing patent applications and having patents granted, not to mention the cost of maintaining patents, and also uncoordinated tax systems. An entrepreneurial Europe needs rewards and opportunities which benefit everyone. So we must fully support the demands that have been made. There is also room for even more commitment. I would like to mention that expert networks also have an important and positive role to play. The provision of risk capital is an important area, but it is not the only issue in business start-ups and expansions: there is also the question of what working capital is available. Lastly, I would like to stress that this is an area where women entrepreneurs should benefit from special support, and I wish to emphasise that we, the European Parliament, should be calling on the Commission to monitor progress in this field by means of benchmarking and a scoreboard process.

 Mr President, I believe that the question is now no longer whether this century or this millennium will be a European one or an Asian one – no, what matters is for both regions to join together in a new partnership. So it is right that the European and Asian Heads of Government should continue to meet through their informal multiple-theme dialogue, and it is particularly important for them to do that in Seoul this year against the historical new background of the possibility of reunification. There is still insufficient interest in mutual understanding between these two regions of the world, although economic and trade policy, and a shared interest in a security partnership, do exist. But these two major regions need to understand each other better and coordinate their affairs so that they can successfully focus on their shared priorities and make some real progress with regard to the reform of the United Nations and the WTO in relation to monetary and financial stability, and also concerning other important issues on the agenda of the International Labour Organisation. The successes of the last two summits in Bangkok and London cannot disguise the fact that the ASEM process is not sufficiently dynamic. Bangkok was all innovation and smiling faces, whereas London provided an initial response to the Asian crisis. Normality in EU-Asian relations is now needed, so that we can finally see some concrete cooperation meaningful to the public. Cooperation should range from the fight against money laundering to environmental commitment and confidence-building measures in security policy and to commitment to food and water supply safety. It should also embrace our successes in the fight against organised crime, and – you are quite right about this, Commissioner – in combating trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation of women and abuse of children. The exchanges between schools, universities and business people are most promising, and the Asia-Europe Foundation is doing sterling work. However, what is at stake now, in 2000, is what ASEM can really achieve and should be able to achieve, and what is best organised at ASEM level. The Vision Group has produced an excellent model here, and one that should be put into more concrete terms. ASEM has certainly done the right thing in focusing on the three pillars of political, economic and cultural cooperation. But we need more than that if we are to make progress in security policy under the OSCE process in Europe and also as regards territorial issues in Asia or human rights and democratic issues in Burma and elsewhere, with a view to stabilising the region. It is also vital for the increasingly important issues of company delocalisations, employment standards and other social issues to be discussed in a social forum which meets at a level comparable with the Business Forum and which facilitates the dialogue between politicians and the social partners on industrial relations and social standards. We really must create a forum of this kind. But we as Members of the European Parliament are also interested in reviving the Europe-Asia parliamentary dialogue. We have organised the first meeting between European and Asian Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg. Now that Europe has taken the first initiative, the ball is in our Asian colleagues' court. Why should Japan or China not run with this ball? It is a pity that in Europe interest in developing closer links with Asia is not as strong as interest in cooperation with other regions of the world. So a parliamentary dialogue also means the public at large becoming involved in cooperation in civil society. We all need to see this as a task for the future, because both these regions of the world have a great deal to say and do.

 Mr President, I would like to make it clear that the fact that Iran has been replaced by Burma in the debate on human rights does not mean that my group is not deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran. We will continue to concern ourselves with that situation. However, the current situation and the scandalous decisions being taken by the Burmese military Government and their appalling behaviour simply make it essential for the European Parliament to take a stand on this. We are full of respect and admiration for the non-violent action, the remarkably consistent action being taken by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and also by the members and politicians of the National League for Democracy. They have earned our unreserved respect, and we wish to assure them that they have our support and that the European Union, together with the international community, will do everything it can to help to restore human rights, or to be more accurate, to introduce human rights, democracy and also the rule of law in Burma. We are certainly still pinning our hopes in San Suu Kyi. Her continuing campaigns show that her voice cannot be silenced and that we in Europe, therefore, also have a duty to do everything to ensure that her voice is heard not only here in Europe, but also in America and above all in Asia. She bears the hopes of the persecuted and the repressed, and also of the many men and women used as forced labour. She also bears the hopes of those citizens who opted for democracy, the parliamentary system and the rule of law before 1990. We must call on our partners, the ASEAN States, but also other states in Asia to do everything to bring about a change in this ‘transitional government’ as it so cynically still calls itself. That is why I think it is right that we should take stronger economic sanctions. The EU has acted correctly here. We now need an institutionalised dialogue, and a debate on Burma should be right at the top of the agenda of the Laos Summit, to make it clear that both ASEAN and the EU bear some responsibility for events in Burma.

. – Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is ten years now since the inception of monetary union. Today we are reviewing an annual report based on a successful monetary policy. In institutional, organisational and monetary policy terms, the European Central Bank has acted prudently while showing the way forward, even if not everyone would agree with all the decisions made by the ECB. However, more could be done to improve the transparency of monetary policy. This is not just a question of improving communication, it is also a matter of providing clearer explanations. That is why I am pleased, Mr Duisenberg, that you have today promised once again that we will get inflation forecasts and that progress will be made with publishing the econometric models. And of course I would still like us to see the summary minutes of meetings, so that we can follow all the arguments. The annual report states very clearly that the euro has made its mark at international level and is already the second most important currency in the world. The report also clearly emphasises that the European Central Bank has achieved its priority objective of ensuring price stability. However, it seems to me that the ECB’s secondary objective is not yet totally clear to everyone. After all, the rate of inflation is low and under control despite the increase in oil prices. This is very different to the situation prevailing at the time of the oil crisis in the 1970s. The ECB must therefore finally make it clear how and subject to what conditions it intends to support the Union’s economic policy and the objectives of achieving economic growth and employment. After all, money exists to serve people, and not the other way round. For that reason support is needed for the macroeconomic framework, and the ECB has a role to play here. As yet, the ECB has still not provided an explanation as to why price stability is more strictly defined in the euro area than in the US, and why it does not provide greater protection for the fledgling European growth process. Europe needs a sustained period of high growth if we are to successfully combat unemployment. After all, full employment is once again a possibility at last. An ECB stability-oriented monetary policy has every chance of giving an impulse to investment and growth, and thus making a real contribution to achieving an appropriate and properly balanced policy mix. What contribution can the ECB make, and does it intend to make? Why does it not follow the example set by the US Federal Reserve Bank in supporting the upturn in the economy? Or could it be – and I would like an answer to this – that the European Central Bank is opposed to growth rates of over 3% because it thinks they could jeopardise its stability policy?
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 – Mr President, on behalf of my Group I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that we support the report, just as we welcome the positive tone of the Commission’s communication. It is high time that we had a more efficient communications strategy and that cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States was improved in this new parliamentary term. The European public not only feels inadequately prepared for the euro, it also genuinely is inadequately prepared for it, both objectively and subjectively speaking. The fact is that the long transitional period has not led to more intensive and careful preparations being made for the introduction of the euro, quite the contrary – it has led to more disinformation and also to preparations being postponed, in some people’s minds even to June 2002. Unfortunately, this seems to apply not only to the public, but also to business. Although 80% of businesses say that they are preparing for the euro and its introduction, objectively speaking at most 25% are making concrete preparations. A sign of this is of course that only 1% of banknotes within the European Union have been converted to date. If we do not tackle this now, fears that we will end up with the dreaded ‘big bang’, which none of the governments wanted, will be totally justified. The governments themselves really must do some advance work, however, and demonstrate greater commitment. I believe that you cannot shift all the responsibility to the European institutions. After all, it is the EU Member States that have a duty to provide political information and education according to the principle of subsidiarity. We really must call on the Member States of the European Union to invest money, time and human resources in ensuring that the euro is a success. It is a matter of regret that up to now public administrations have not led the way as they should have done. I think it is also important, and the rapporteur has quite rightly drawn attention to this, for schools, teachers and places of education to prepare people for the euro. The euro must become part of education across the board. It is not enough to have a few successful but extremely modest Socrates projects about the euro in Europe’s schools. No, this is really a job that needs to be successfully handled at local level. I think it would be wonderful if the schools, Europe’s young people, welcomed the euro as a tangible sign of Europe, and if everyone used their own preparations to communicate with others. This is also something that the older generation, who are generally so sceptical about the euro, could do. Why should older people in the European Union not use their experience, their knowledge and also the time that they have available in order to make the euro a success? Maybe this is an area where we could have a kind of new pact between the generations that would help the euro project to succeed.  The Commission certainly needs to work even more closely with us and to step up the pace of its involvement. But we should not forget that the resources for the information campaign are extremely slight and have to be shared out between the Member States. No company introducing an important product would rely on such modest resources to ensure that a product was a success. A powerful argument in favour of the euro is the initial positive experience with monetary union, which has in fact provided protection against turbulent currency markets in recent times. But it is also a matter of turning information into education, because at the end of the day we need to acquire a totally new way of looking at prices, making calculations and judging values. We should not be deceived by the painless transition on 1 January 1999. Nor should we be deceived by the almost automatic transition to the new millennium. We also need to prepare for the euro psychologically. We must all do this together, at all levels of the European Union!

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and I am pleased that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is to negotiate, for the first time, with the troika of EU Finance Ministers on the broad outlines of economic policy, will enter into these negotiations with a report that will attract a broad consensus. We all know that Lisbon brought a fresh wind of change, and it would only be to the good if the broad outlines of economic policy were to exude more of the spirit of the Lisbon EU Summit. The main issue facing the European Union, combating unemployment that is, is still not being treated as the most important aspect of the broad outlines of economic policies. After all, the cost of unemployment in the European Union is estimated to be 12% of European GDP. Therefore, the European Union is right to make full employment its goal.   What concerns me most is that the broad outlines of economic policy are still lacking in commitment when it comes to taking advantage of increased investment activity. We are certainly doing the right thing in aiming for structural reform of the goods, services, capital and labour markets. However, whilst we do not yet know what effects structural reforms of this kind will have on employment, we do know what the effects of investment-backed growth are. We know that public investment can boost growth and employment as well. That is why we should welcome the introduction of quantitative targets for growth and employment quotas, for they supplement quantitative targets and benchmarking for investments.   I also regret the fact that the targets set at Lisbon – and consequently, those set in relation to the broad outlines of economic policy as well – are not qualitative in nature. Surely this could only benefit Europe, which wants to be the most competitive zone in the whole world. Nor is there any indication whatsoever as to what level of investment as a share of GDP we need to aim for in what time frame, in order to produce a sustainable upturn. The current upward trend is encouraging, especially since the German and Italian economies, which account for half of the net product in euroland, are at last starting to move. This is a perfect illustration of how interdependent and interwoven the European national economies are, for they have not exactly acted as engines of growth on the European economy as a whole.   Consequently, we are aware that we need a form of economic government in Europe. Europe must sing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to economic policy. We therefore need better coordination than we have had hitherto. Hence, I hope that the broad outlines of economic policy will be given substance, so as to render the language of the Lisbon decisions more comprehensible, and enable a timetable to be set. Of course, we must support the rapporteur in his desire for something we have repeatedly called for ourselves: what we need is an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so as to overcome the democratic deficit in Economic and Monetary Union.

Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists endorses the rapporteur’s proposals because it is quite clear from the first published report on the stability and convergence programmes that these programmes, along with the review, are not a mere exercise, rather, for the very first time within the European Union, and especially within the euro zone, it is understood that economic developments, the financial perspectives, and also commitment in terms of budgetary policy, are not just the affair of an individual Member State, but of all Member States. That is why it is right that the European Parliament should take these reports seriously, and go so far as to examine once again not only whether monetary union has created an internal market, with no currency fluctuations or attendant negative effects on growth and employment, but whether the Member States have actually kept their promises; i.e. those that belong to the euro zone and those that are to submit convergence programmes.   After all, monetary union is actually laid down and provided for in the Treaty of Maastricht as a Community of stability. Only States that have demonstrated their ability to maintain price stability and financial solidity, and that can help to make the monetary union a real Community of stability, are able to join monetary union. Exactly the same applies to Greece. We will have further debates on this. To Mr Karas I have to say that the requirements we make of Italy and Belgium, for example, regarding debt reduction, will, of course, apply to Greece as well. We will also keep an eye out for overly optimistic data being submitted in this regard. Greece must be able to make the grade in this respect too.   It is evident from the annual exercise concerning the stability and convergence programmes that the EU Member States are seasoned partners that are able to withstand criticism. They must allow their partners to scrutinise their economic and budgetary status quo, and accept and act on their conclusions. Hence, the second round will be far more important than the current one, because, for the first time, actual criticism has been voiced. We have yet to see what effect this will have on future programmes.   One matter of regret to my mind though, is that the EU Finance Ministers are not yet using the working method of the Luxembourg Process on the employment guidelines as a benchmark. It is also regrettable that, consequently, it has not been possible to add to the progress made on the stability and convergence front, because the programmes have not been compared in terms of quality. I therefore believe that if these points were to be taken up, it could further enhance harmonisation, both in the context of the development of the internal market and of the euro zone. The same applies to coordination of the taxation systems. Tax coordination worthy of the name must at last prevail within the EU.

 Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is convinced by the efforts Greece has made to fulfil the convergence criteria. We support the recommendation and the rapporteur’s report. It is important for the European internal market to at last be properly completed. This will only be feasible if every last Member State of the European Union joins monetary union. It is therefore important from the point of view of business and commerce for all EU States to join, especially those that are able to fulfil the convergence criteria. Only then will it be possible to protect an even larger part of the economic area against exchange rate fluctuations.  A large currency union would also improve our chances of being able to coordinate economic policies, and hence achieve deeper European integration. Like any other Member of the European Monetary Union, Greece will have to continue to make efforts and to acquit itself of its responsibilities. That goes without saying, particularly where the level of debt in Greece is concerned. As mentioned before, Greece, along with Belgium and Italy, have been singled out for monitoring on this aspect. But I would also like to ask you once again to consider that the examination of other States’ stability programmes that took place last year also gave rise to criticism. As such, Greece is not the only State to have to keep proving itself over and over again in this respect.   A permanent Community of solidarity – which is precisely what monetary union is – demands sustained harmonisation activity. That is what the partners of monetary union have promised themselves and they must keep their promise. Both the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact give expression to this.   Like other Members before it, Greece is going to have to work on being able to sustain its fulfilment of the convergence criteria. The interest rate adjustments that Greece needs to make to bring it into line with the euro zone are making heavy demands on its economy, society and social partners. That is why it is so important for there to be consensus between the major political parties and the social partners. It will enable us to feel confident that Greece will prove to be a successful partner in monetary union.   There is no reason to fear that monetary union will be weakened by Greece joining, because it is the stability of the currency that matters. Any country that wants to join the euro zone must fulfil the convergence criteria. In the long term, internal stability is only crucial to the external value of a currency. The fact that the average rate of inflation in the euro zone is 1.9% is a clear illustration of this. I would remind you once again, in this connection, that the Treaty of Maastricht states that we need a monetary policy that guarantees the stability of the currency. This was achieved in the first few months of the euro zone’s existence. The dollar/euro exchange rate cannot be used to guide monetary policy. What matters is that the internal purchasing power of the euro is very stable, as used to be the case with the Deutschmark.

 Mr President, the directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies that distort competition. To this end, it proposes to require public undertakings, and private undertakings that perform public tasks, to carry out separate accounting procedures, recording separately the reserved and the competitive spheres of the business. The legal basis for the directive is Article 86(3), and the Commission is therefore authorised to issue the directive itself. In fact this is now out of step with the spirit of the time, and with what we understand by European legislation, and must be changed. But today’s debate is to be welcomed with open arms because it exemplifies the new form of transparency in the Commission’s legislative work in areas where it has supervisory powers, and also bears witness to the interest Commissioner Monti and his offices take in the opinion of the European Parliament.   The businesses which the directive covers have special or exclusive rights or provide services of general economic interest. As such, the possibility exists that cross-subsidies are provided, and also that complaints about cross-subsidies will ensue. Thousands of businesses will be affected. It seems debatable as to whether they will actually consider the burden the directive imposes to be commensurate with its aims. The majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has wholeheartedly endorsed this measure because there is a need for more transparency within the internal market. The whole committee would agree with this, even if the rapporteur represented the minority view in some areas. It is doubtful as to whether the measure really seems suited to following up suspicions concerning competition-distorting subsidies, particularly as it fails to provide any harmonised internal accounting procedures at European level.   I am formulating these doubts so as to afford the Commission the opportunity to dispel some of them in a concrete and constructive manner at the revision stage. I have already mentioned that the Commission is expecting complaints about cross-subsidies, and has actually already dealt with complaints in the past. However, it has also been apparent in the past that the Commission has always made provision for sector-specific regulations, which cover a variety of regulatory areas. Unfortunately, it did not continue down this path. Of course, one could say that it would be easier if we now had a uniform regulation for the remaining areas, and indeed that was the view taken by the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. However, I also believe that any directive should be assessed according to its efficiency, careful targeting, precision and subtlety, so as to enable the Commission to carry out its supervisory function to optimum effect.  There was a further problem with the discussions on this directive in that the Commission failed to emphasise that, under Article 295 of the EC Treaty, it is entirely the Member States’ responsibility to determine what services are of general economic interest and how they should be provided. I ask myself whether the Commission’s ulterior motive, in failing to emphasise this in the transparency directive, is to tamper with this sovereign definition by slow degrees, thereby undermining the principle of subsidiarity. It is for the Member States to decide whether supplying television transmitters constitutes a public task and, as such, whether or not every single transmission is included. It is not appropriate for the EU to intervene here. In this respect, there should be another reference in the text of the directive to the Amsterdam Protocol, because this established that it is the responsibility of the Member States to establish the financial and organisational structures for public service broadcasting corporations and their different activities. Aid for fulfilment of public tasks is expressly permitted, and this was the position adopted by the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. However, broadcasting corporations may not receive state aid where they operate outside their public remit.   And so the Commission must, as a matter of principle, clarify that under no circumstances will it cast doubt on the meaning of ‘services of general economic interest’ per se. It must make it clear that the draft directive does not constitute a further attack on the system of public undertakings. Needless to say, the competition rules must be adhered to by all. Indeed it is important and right for the competition rules to be applied effectively and fairly and for cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of aid to be prevented. However, competition rules are not an end in themselves but the means to an end of undisrupted operation of a social market economy in the internal market.

 Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn said, state pension schemes, as the first pillar, must be supplemented by supplementary company pension schemes which are efficient and therefore also increase legal certainty, and which actually do justice to one’s entitlement to a pension. A directive must not be used to make a name for a particular form of insurance and what is more, to equate provisions for old age with capital building processes, because at the end of the day, supplementary pensions products are no ordinary investment products. That is why I really think it is very important for us to have different taxation systems in the Member States, particularly for those products that also cover biometric risks.   That is why today’s debate has in fact enabled us to embark on the further deepening of the single market, for in the single market and the euro we have, for the first time, the environment we need to get the financial service providers in the EU to operate in a truly efficient manner, and to enable us to take account of the idea of financial legislation and financial supervision.   Of course we would not wish to deter the market participants from making good use of improved business opportunities. On the other hand though, we also want to safeguard financial stability and consumer protection interests. The European Summit in Lisbon was right to emphasise again the importance of having integrated and efficient financial markets, and this House will also be in favour of keeping to a strict timetable. At the same time though, we must do all we can, in view of the single market and the introduction of the euro, to improve the capital base for small and medium-sized enterprises and high technology companies in particular. We must also do all we can to take account of measures favouring effective, cross-border consumer protection in the process. It will also be necessary, to this end, to improve cooperation between the regulatory and supervisory authorities at European level. There is also a need for financial stability, and it has to be said at this point, that the increase in company mergers in the financial sector constitutes a serious problem at present. We would also do well to refer to the OECD reports, which make clear reference to the risks posed by megamergers in this sector. At the end of the day, when financial conglomerates that are too big to fail come into being, not only does this increase the moral hazard of the institutes concerned, but the economic and financial policies of the States concerned are also faced with new risks. We must do everything we can to prevent any weakening of financial stability, for this would lead to companies making use of the profits and tax payers having to sustain any losses.   It is regrettable that there is no direct consideration of consumer protection in the Lisbon Conclusions. Unless we establish a reliable legal framework which is as informative and transparent as it could possibly be, not to mention liability for the benefit of the consumer, it will not be possible to complete the single market…   (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, electronic money does not yet have the same importance in the European Union as e-commerce, e-business, e-Europe. We must ensure, of course, that we in Europe also increase our competitiveness in this area vis-à-vis the United States. The introduction of the Euro will undoubtedly have a positive effect and will mean that the time has also come for us to establish uniform regulations to safeguard electronic commerce. I think that electronic money will gain in importance, not just in commerce but also for consumers, particularly as the safety precautions on the Internet are regarded as inadequate and many are therefore hesitant to choose this option. It has to be said that electronic money in the European Union today enjoys rarity value rather than common usage. This must change! In this regard I must also point out that within the European Union these electronic payment systems also fail to work because interoperability is not guaranteed. I think that we should do something about this if we want to promote this means of payment in future. We must also do it in the interests of consumers, because costs will be saved. However, the issuing of electronic money is not just about the simplification or safeguarding of payment processes, but in practice also concerns financial stability and the functioning of the payment systems. For this reason we need uniform regulations and we must realise that there will be particular fears if electronic money is issued not just against cash holdings or similar bank account holdings, but if e-money is given on credit. I think that this is the particular cause of the fear of instability instead of the stability which we want to ensure in the European Union. I therefore think that Article 8, which provides for an extension of the conditions for exemption, creates excessive discretionary powers. This could result in many electronic money institutions not being affected by the regulations applicable to credit institutions. This cannot and should not be the case and we all know that national issues of e-money can no longer be guaranteed today, if we look at the wording of Article 8c in particular. The Council’s amendments, which extend the scope of money, cannot be in the interest of the consumer. We need electronic money which is valid in a given environment. For this reason, it must cover the entire European area and not just a national area. I also think that institutions issuing e-money should be treated as equal. It is, of course, also important to consider the role of the European Central Bank – controlling the amount of money in circulation, for example. However, I am thinking primarily of consumers. Even if e-money can be used without limit on the Internet and for mobile telephones, this does not mean that it might not be counterproductive. For this reason I cannot support the new wording of Article 8c. I think that we must do everything possible to increase consumer confidence in the electronic money age and not to build consumer foundations which have no stability.

 Mr President-in-Office, you have made us in the European Parliament eager to leave for Lisbon already. All of us can only hope that the Special Summit is able to live up to the high expectations which people have of it. Because, as you have already stressed, we do not need one more process after another, one procedure after another; rather we need action by which the people of the European Union can measure the benefits and added value of what the European Union does. That is also why you have rightly drawn together employment, economic reform, growth and social cohesion and made them issues for top-level action. It is important for all players in the governments and in the Commission to be pulling in the same direction towards full employment. Then it will also be possible to convince all economic policy-makers of the need to conform to agreed behaviour, which so far they unfortunately still have not yet done. Europe need lament neither over the success of the US economy nor over the strong dollar if it does not learn any lessons for itself from it. Reforms of financial services, services capital and labour markets are certainly useful and necessary. But they alone will not give growth the stimulus it needs to enable long-lasting growth, effectively generating jobs, to be organised at a high level. We were forced to experience this several times in the nineties. An average productivity increase of 2% requires a growth rate of 3.5% for full employment to be able to be achieved within ten years. This scenario has moved into the foreseeable future. That is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda. We need to set a growth target of at least 3%. The aim of full employment cannot be achieved by economic policy alone. The Europe of innovation and the information society also need to be commandeered to reach this target. We are a long way from it today. We must also recognise that we need another type of economic and financial policy. It is simply unacceptable for shareholders or directors of plcs to be the only ones who decide on jobs, the economy and share prices. When 13-year-old school children play on the computer after school at restructuring their parents' share portfolios, then this has more to do with toy casinos than with responsibility. I think that the Special Summit in Lisbon will herald responsible economic planning in the European Union.

 Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the comprehensive, extremely important and highly informative work that he has carried out. I would like to re-emphasise the value of the extensive deliberations that we had in committee with the experts, who, fortunately for us, made themselves available to Parliament. These experts were most emphatic about how important it is to take investment-related measures and to employ demand-orientated instruments. By that, I do not think they mean what you have just termed the Keynesian school of thought of yesteryear, Mr von Wogau, for no one wants a lack of stability or solidity, rather we must at last find the right policy mix here in the European Union. This involves both supply- and demand-orientated measures. We see this in other countries of the world that have been pursuing this very strategy for many years now, and which are more successful than your homeland, for example.   I am certainly not overly pessimistic with regard to the prospects for the European Union. After all, we can see that after a year of economic and monetary union in the European Union, the economy has undergone a distinct recovery. The Commission’s annual report on the economy is right to anticipate positive trends. After all, the global economic and political conditions are favourable, they just have to be utilised. We must at long last resolve to coordinate things in such a way that we create real synergy of the kind that will actually facilitate a high level of sustainable growth for many years to come.  I must say that this business with the euro-dollar exchange rate does not worry me, not just because I see potential here for revaluation of the euro, no, because the euro-dollar exchange rate is giving the European export economy an additional boost, thereby underpinning its role as a driving force in the economy during an important phase of European economic development. As I said before, the European Union still lacks a common growth strategy, which would be instrumental in enabling us to actually use the interdependence of the EU national economies to best advantage, and in enabling the internal market to function to optimum effect This does not just have to do with the fact that there is still a lack of structural reform. Of course, it is important for us to undertake structural reform. But has anyone ever calculated the economic impact of this structural reform, to enable us to see what it could actually contribute in the way of growth, investment and employment? Seen in this light, we cannot dispense with structured growth.  I think it is a shame that even now, not all participants in the macroeconomic dialogue see the need for coordination. We simply must be aware that we are still not free of external risks, and European growth, growth within the EU, is still subject to internal risks. At the end of the day, there are, for example, indicators here in the European Union that show that growth and its prospects are by no means as solid as they were in the 80s. This also has something to do with confidence. I do not believe that we should leave it to the financial markets to pass judgement, but we must ensure that both consumers and manufacturing gain in confidence where development in the European Union is concerned.   There is also a need for a common European approach – I would not dispute this – in the development of wage policy, which, I believe, has already been brought into line in the EU, in exemplary fashion, with the productivity and inflation objectives of the ECB. It should not boil down to a renationalisation of the fight against inflation at Member State level, this fight being waged due to the pressure exerted by increased oil and raw materials prices.   An independent evaluation of European economic policy will be of importance to the European Union and to structured growth. What we need is an annual report on the economic and social situation in the Union, so as to enable us to develop an EU policy with benchmarking and specific quantitative and qualitative figures and objectives for investment and growth. This must be incorporated into the cornerstones of economic policy. It is my belief that, at the end of the day, any violation of this policy must be followed up by a detailed analysis of causes with regard to the respective national economy.   Of course, the benefits arising from favourable economic growth should now be put to use in helping to alleviate structural shortfalls more intensely, and rightly so. However, the benefits of growth should also be used for investment in the information society, and in research and development, as well as in that expensive raw material ‘labour’. Measures including Internet access in every school or lifelong learning would constitute a sound approach in this respect – which even opponents of state expenditure programmes would have to agree to – so as to secure future prospects and full employment for the citizens of the Union.

 Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition. At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today. At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets. Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission’s proposal. We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board. This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products. It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission’s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions. However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers – who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings – that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection. Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice? I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund’s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile. (Applause)

Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one. We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies. We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is. This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy. We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union. We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past. We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises. It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information. It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is. We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice. At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions. I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure. This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 Mr President, the European Union’s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began. It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.  It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies. We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality. We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision. However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits. That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy’s reign of terror. Society is surrendering itself to the economy. That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union. We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers – in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs – restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need. European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public. In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned. It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.  It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection. I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public. Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy. Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context. It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement. Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy – and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear – must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis. At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives. A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy. I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation. The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement. The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system. Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.
Randzio-Plath (PSE

 Mr President, the 1995 changeover plan has proved to be worthwhile. The rapporteur rightly emphasises the careful preparations leading up to the introduction of the euro, and we must ensure that the euro does indeed enjoy the confidence of the citizens and not just that of the markets, where it is now established. The first year of the euro’s introduction and life with monetary union is associated, then, with a lack of awareness of the euro on the part of the citizens, that is to say the consumers. It is not without reason that as yet, only 1% of transfers and 4% of credit card transactions are performed in euros. This would suggest that we really do need information campaigns. Not only did we need to have these campaigns in the years before monetary union started, we also need to pursue them now that it is in force, and this is not a task that we should just leave to the European Central Bank. We, too, in our capacity as European Commission, European Parliament, and governments of the Member States, must launch a new initiative in this respect, so that political discussions on the value of the euro do not cause the citizens to suddenly start thinking that, although they may inhabit a monetary union, this has lent no added value to Europe. Rather, they must be made aware of the fact that they are living in an age of new monetary reform. This false assumption, which is still very much prevalent because the exchange rate between the euro, the dollar and the yen has, I regret to say, developed rather differently than appeared would be the case on 4 January, must not, however, lead to a situation in which erroneous ideas as to the value of the euro hold sway. The internal value of the currency is decisive and the fact that we can record values for the euro 11-zone that truly inspire confidence is of historic importance. It is a good thing that it is becoming clear, and is made transparent time and time again in the monetary dialogue between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank, how important price stability is for this independent, monetary authority; and it is a good thing that the ECB should see that this goal is accomplished in a manner accessible to ordinary citizens.  I believe it would be wrong to break out in a panic now, here in this Chamber, on account of exchange rate trends. I think the exchange rates are exhausted in any case. The important thing to do in these circumstances, though, is to support the development of the euro by having more coordination of economic policy within the European Union. Monetary policy will not be in a position to enhance the credibility of European integration for the benefit of growth, employment and also investment, if the Member States of the European Union do not, coincidentally with the harmonisation and centralisation of monetary policy, join forces more resolutely in giving out signals against tax dumping and social dumping, and in favour of increased employment.

Mr President, Europe’s new role in the world will be conditioned by external and security policy, but also by the tensions between social, economic and political needs. The world trade round is therefore exceptionally important in Europe speaking with a single voice in world trade negotiations so that social and environmentally-friendly growth can also gather pace through the contribution of world trade. Since 1990 there has been a worldwide increase in mergers and also the market power of transnational concerns. It is therefore very important that the Millennium Round creates multilateral rules against private restrictions in competition. An international competition system must create minimum norms so as to prevent anti-competitive behaviour such as the forming of price and area cartels, the misuse of a market-dominant position or vertical and horizontal competitive restrictions which distort competition. Part of these minimum norms must be the obligation for WTO Member States to bring their domestic competition law into line with multilateral agreements and minimum norms. This means that the Millennium Round must not create a global cartel authority. It must, however, subject domestic competition rules to monitoring. It would be contrary to the rules of GATT, CFSP and WTO if free and fair world trade between states were valid, but not for private economic players. Monopolies and cartels damage consumers and societies. The Microsoft case in the USA clearly demonstrated this. The increasing willingness for mergers between transnational companies and the impotence of the national state with regard to the formation of monopolies, oligopolies and cartels endanger the objectives of world trade to contribute to prosperity and peace worldwide. Furthermore, it is also particularly important that we realise that the decrease in growth in the world economy is also linked to the instability of the international finance system, which is characterised by vast, rapid and worldwide financial transactions and which has detached itself from the real economy, yet still affects investments, growth and employment. For this reason, the Millennium Round must contribute to coherence in the world economy between trade, economic, currency and financial policies.

 Mr President, thanks are due to the two rapporteurs. Finland’s Portugal’s and France’s Presidencies of the Council are to be requested to comply with the proposals in this report which is quite rightly based upon the criticism, partly by this European Parliament, of the decisions in Amsterdam. For no other reason than that Mr Tsatsos has again referred to the matter, I should like to emphasise that the proposal in subparagraph 5 is really of central importance. It is important that we obtain a package proposal for global reform in which the important questions relating to majority voting are dealt with just as much as those relating to reform of the institutions and other important themes. I think that the most important thing here is that we consider how the European Union might be provided with a constitution. This demand can hardly be emphasised enough, for Europe can only come of age when it provides itself with a constitution.  The purposes and goals of the European Union are too unclear at the moment. The European Parliament has quite rightly already submitted several draft constitutions, and I think that these ought to make it clear that Europe is more than a market. We must therefore be thinking in terms of a Brussels Republic, a unique community of States without historical precedent.  Whether the discussion of a European constitution will imbue Europe’s citizens with more enthusiasm for Europe is unclear. On account of the problems entailed in legitimising an area or a market without the structure of a State, the attempt does need, however, to be made to inspire such enthusiasm. This must also go hand in hand with the development of a European civil society and of a European public. We are seeing a change worldwide in the essential character of national sovereignty because States do not have unlimited freedom of action, either at home or abroad, and their ability to form policies and solve problems is limited by the realities of international relations and of trans-national forms of interdependence and interaction. This is particularly apparent in connection with the economy, trade and competition. It is precisely in this area, too, that it is very important to move from the principle of unanimity to majority voting. The European Union must become better able to act and it therefore needs a new separation of powers through a catalogue of competences.  In view of the changed circumstances, a new system for the separation of powers must be devised which augments the classical separation of powers as prescribed by Montesquieu with a new form of separation of powers at different levels. We need integrated multi-level decision-making processes. The coordination processes at present prescribed are inadequate to the task of organising European added value. That is particularly clear from the difficulties between economic union and monetary union and the difficulties between the political union and the economic and monetary union. Since we cannot boost democracy, through interinstitutional agreements in this area, we also, in fact, require a revision of the Treaty in this regard.

 Mr President unspecified allegations of misconduct made about me and about some of my colleagues are appearing in the German press. This is something we have already discussed in this House. Unfortunately, it is not my work to which these reports refer; instead, there are only allegations to the effect that there is something objectionable about my behaviour, but as I am unable to ascertain what I am being accused of, I ask you, Mr President, to investigate further. It is also stated in the German media that you are to meet a certain Member this week and that the Member in question will then hand over certain lists to you. If this is the case, Mr President, I ask you to find out at once whether there is anything of which my colleagues or I might be accused. If there is, then I ask that you forward all the documents, at once, to the European Court of Justice or to the Court of Auditors and to OLAF. It would of course be good of you to inform those against whom the media are making what are really very nasty, dirty and unpleasant accusations, of what precisely they are being accused – that is, of whether they have been bad at their jobs or have broken the law.

 Thank you Mr President. We do not want to discuss the substance of the report; we have already had a debate about it in committee. Although we did indeed get the expert opinion to which Mr Florenz referred, it did not back up his arguments but those of my group and also Mr Kronberger’s approach. It makes sense to hold over the vote. We are at the end of a parliamentary term and want, if possible, to come to an agreement at first reading, so that we will not have to start from the beginning again when the House reconvenes, going through first reading again and then debating the common position. Having the vote itself at the next sitting will not take up much time, and so I ask you, Mr President, to put it to the vote. This is what my group will be asking for and thereby supporting Mr Kronberger in having just the debate this week.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Byrne, I am sure that the Commission has done its best; I leave it to you to decide whether that, in a report, is always what we want to read. I also wonder whether what we do is always enough, and whether we really are thinking in terms of what is called preventative consumer protection. In saying this, Commissioner Byrne, it is not you alone that I have in mind, but all of us, as well as the governments and your fellow-Commissioners. I will come to that in a moment. As soon as we heard the first reports of avian influenza, we immediately stopped imports from Thailand into the European Union. Not much imagination would have been needed to announce on the same day that the whole of Asia would be sealed off, which would have been sensible. It is, perhaps, not very smart to use the domino approach by starting with Thailand and then moving on to Vietnam and then China. It would have made sense in view of what we know about how business is done in these countries and how birds and other animals, are traded and sold within them. What bothers me is the permanent state of re
-action. We are always re
-acting. Along comes avian influenza, we react to it, and then, for whatever reason, nothing happens for a long time. We discover that poultry meat contains dioxin – and we react. We discover the presence of prohibited, toxic, and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in shrimps and other products – and we react. We react, though, always and only on the spur of the moment, and promptly forget all about it. That is so naive, so boundlessly naive, for we know that the conditions under which animals are kept in the countries under discussion, and the standards of hygiene in Asian countries, but in Brazil as well, are dire in comparison with our own. As this is something we keep asking about in this House, I really would like to know what happens when the Commissioners discuss this around their table. When we ask Commissioner Lamy to give priority, in discussions on the World Trade Organisation, to consumer protection and hygiene policy as matters to be negotiated with third countries, I know that the most we can expect by way of response is a warm smile. We can content ourselves with that, but if we do not change our own system too, we will keep on ending up in situations like this one, of having to react to a pandemic which frightens our people and – I say this quite seriously – will of course have an effect on the economy. As Mrs Jackson said, most chicken mince ends up in burgers or in Chinese ready meals of one sort or another. People are unsettled; they will stop buying these products for a period of time, and that, to a large extent, will of course have an effect on our economy. The reasons for all this are very simple, and are to be found not only in the hygiene conditions, but also – and let me make this quite clear – in our having been too soft. As you will recall, Commissioner Byrne, I called upon you some time ago, when we were discussing dioxin and other products, to announce a ban on imports from China and other countries, simply for disciplinary or educational effect. Then we are always kind and say that these countries must have our support. That is a mistake. We will have something to say later on about the European Centre on Communicable Diseases. You made reference to serious steps, that is, to serious measures and courses of action; I am sure they will all be marvellous, but only after a few years have passed. Right now, they are no use to us whatever; right now, the only thing that is any use is to announce that we will protect the people of the European Union, for it is for them that we are working in this House. Let us protect them! Are we certain that the viruses that transmit avian influenza among birds and poultry cannot be passed on to human beings? Have we done enough research? That brings me to my next point, and – Mr President – it will be my last. When we are discussing the European Union’s Budget and the financial perspective, I always hear a lot said about regional policy, and a lot about aid policy and other matters. Do I even once hear anything said about how we are stringently requiring the Member States to ensure that enough research is being done into ways of protecting human beings from disease? In that context, never; nor is it one of the European Union’s priorities. I would be grateful to you, Commissioner Byrne, if you could ensure that the financial perspective will include, as one of its priorities, an obligation on the Member States to spend money on research into vaccines capable of protecting people against the diseases that may come our way in the future.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 Thank you, Mr President; ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to avoid repeating what has already been said, and also to avoid taking a diversion into discussing communicable diseases such as influenza, viruses and so on. Mr Bowis started his speech by saying that ‘he who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything’. In that case, this morning, I feel very rich, for I have everything. I have hope, and that is everything. I have little more than that. I hope that the centre we are discussing today will very soon become operational. Mrs Grossetête gave a very clear description of what this centre will have to be able to do in order to be effective. In essence, it will have to square the circle. With relatively few people, based a long way away in the north of the European Union, in Sweden, it will have to maintain intensive contact with all the Member States; it will have to motivate their health ministries, spend money and build up information networks, at the same time as maintaining contact with the Commission and with Parliament. Although this involves squaring a circle, I do have hope, and so, like Mr Bowis, I have everything. I cannot do other than agree wholeheartedly with Mrs Grossetête when she says that it is important that we do our work quickly, that it is important that we get things up and running. It follows, though, that the people who work there will have to be highly independent, work in very unconventional ways and possess imagination and the ability to work on their own initiative. By no means everyone can do these things. Looking at a number of other authorities that we have set up over the past few years, I have to say that their success is not exactly self-evident. Now there is the possibility of us coming to a different conclusion. As my fellow-Members have spoken about this Centre in great detail, I have to say what I would have liked to have seen. Hope, in my mind, is associated with aspiration. Of course communicable diseases are important, and of course the fight against them is important in terms of protecting the citizens of this European Union of ours, but let us be clear-sighted about the fact that most people in the European Union do not die of communicable diseases; they die of cancer, of heart attacks, and of strokes. How is it that it is a matter of chance whether you survive a heart attack, depending on whether you live in Berlin or in Madrid, or somewhere else? How is it that best practice in the treatment of cancer cases is not as yet established and communicated in the European Union? I regard that as an intolerable state of affairs. I wish we had been more ambitious and had said that the least we need is to link up best practice within the European Union in order to fight the real diseases that we have to cope with at the moment. Networking would have been within the competence of the European Union, and we could have afforded it. We did not manage it the first time round, but I hope we will, at the second attempt, ensure that people’s recovery from serious illness is not a matter of chance and does not depend on whether they live in the North, the South, the heart of Germany or on its plains, or in some other part of the European Union. Thank you.

Mr President, Mr Berlusconi’s appearances in this House are remarkable in many ways. Today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have managed to speak for 19 minutes and 39 seconds, in which time you have had a great deal to say about economic growth, competitiveness, innovation, industrial policy, then back to increased competitiveness and to foreign policy. All of these are things we can agree with. Yet you did not manage, in these 19 minutes and 39 seconds, to say one word, not even one syllable, on the subject of environmental policy or sustainability. We can be grateful to Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, for evidently thinking in what are evidently less simplistic ways and for having, moreover, a good memory, as he did indeed say that the European Union’s policies must always be guided by the principle of sustainability, and he reminded us all of the Lisbon process, of which I am sure that you too have some recollection. What the Lisbon process means is that the European Union’s policies must, of course, enable it to compete, whilst always taking account of considerations of the environment and of sustainability. You have managed to insert into the Council Conclusions a statement on industrial policy to the effect that the consequences of all proposed EU legislation on enterprises are to be taken into account by providing a comprehensive impact assessment, and have, by way of providing a good example, immediately proposed starting with chemicals policy, which you, surprisingly, want to have dealt with in the Competition Council rather than in the Environment Council. This was a great surprise – certainly one of last week’s surprising moments – not only for me, but also many of your fellow-members of the Council. I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Berlusconi, whether you are aware that environmental policy is not just something that we do because we are good or perhaps because we want to try and do things in an ecological way; but rather that we do it because it makes our industry competitive and because it enables us to pass on our planet and our immediate environment to our children, and perhaps because it enables us to maintain the good living conditions that we enjoy. When you last appeared before this House, I asked you whether you intended to apply your strength and somewhat more energy to advancing the European Union’s environmental measures. To that question you would not give an answer. I hope that you will now give me an answer setting out your position on your policies’ ecological aspects and how you personally would assess your resources and the progress you have made so far, precisely what you conceive of as success in ecological terms, and whether you have to date achieved any sort of success in the area of environmental policy.

Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, you have described the situation in very clear terms, and I was glad that you, as a former environment minister, also pointed out that disasters do not happen on their own. I respect the calls for solidarity that Members from the countries particularly affected are quite naturally making. They are right to do so. Members from countries such as France, Portugal, and other countries in south-eastern Europe, are right to call for solidarity, but – and let me make this quite clear – I would not want us to limit our present discussion to whether it is 31 million, 90 million or 120 million that we need in order to repair the damage, for it is equally apparent – and you, Mr Barnier, have also made it very clear – that we are patching things up. If we do not want to carry on patching things up year after year, we have to give some thought to the causes. Another reason why we have to think about the causes is that we will, at some point, exhaust our capacity for making good the damage. As of next year, we will have twenty-five Member States. This will not double the Budget, and disasters will keep on happening – floods, storms, heatwaves and fires, in varying sequences, and, as you have observed, Mr Barnier, this has something to do with climate change. Nobody is now left unaware of that. Are we, though, prepared to act consistently with what we know? Let me say bluntly that no, we are not. We, all of us, are unprepared, and we are in fact unwilling to listen to something so uncomfortable. Here in the European Union, we are far from creating the conditions in which the Kyoto criteria can be fulfilled. At present, only three Member States – Germany, Great Britain and Sweden – are getting anywhere near it. At the moment, we are at most complying with half the Kyoto criteria, by cutting back on gases that have a detrimental effect upon the climate, causing, for example, global warming, due to greenhouse gases, which occur in agriculture and in waste disposal but especially, in the areas of energy and transport. We are not prepared to take action and to be consistent when it comes to changing the underlying causes. Road traffic is constantly increasing, and we know that it is one of the principal sources of greenhouse gases, and is so to an increasing extent. At the moment, road traffic accounts for some 20% of total emissions, and in 2010, the deadline for getting in line with the Kyoto Protocol, the figure will be 28%. So you see that we may well be talking about disasters, but we are unwilling to do anything to prevent them. What I am putting before you is utterly sober fact. You will not be surprised when I say that we never, of course, set our sights high in matters of environmental policy. I have now been an MEP for more or less fourteen years, in which time I have been involved in environmental policy, but I also know perfectly well where we all stand when it comes to passing real legislation. What happens when we talk in terms of taxing kerosene, the fuel used in aircraft? What will happen if we tell Mr Barnier to strictly limit structural funding to such things as rail transport or action that benefits the environment? I’d like to hear what our counterparts in the stricken countries have to say about this! Once and for all, we have to create incentives to do such things as getting traffic off the roads and onto rails, using preferential treatment, rewards, and also sanctions, although it is the sanctions that this House never wants. It also means, for example, that we reduce emissions from industry, that we take action to improve controls, that we tax activities that do harm. What did we do at the beginning of this year when there was talk of taxing the generation of energy? We funked it. The Council funked it, and again, we all chickened out. Although the Commission has, to some degree, gone on ahead, we all, again and again, find ourselves influenced by what we term the needs of our electoral districts, where there is industry that does not want influence exerted on it, that produces chemicals – which do matter! – that produces pesticides, and we have to use them. None of us, then, really wants to do anything, but every year, once summer or autumn is over, we stand up in this House and talk about disasters. Let me mention, in addition to that, the report I have read in the press to the effect that the chairman of the French old people’s homes association has said that there are four times as many staff in German old people’s homes. That appals me; it is quite shocking, for German old people’s homes are generally in a disastrous state. It follows that we in the European Union must also, at long last, put solidarity into practice in social services. We have to lay down once and for all what standards apply to people who live in the European Union. How then are they to live with dignity in old people’s homes, and what is the situation with health insurance? As you are aware, I wanted the constitution to give the European Union clear competences in health policy. We did not manage to do that. They did not manage to do that. It looks as if we did not want it; that is something I regret. If, though, we are talking about disasters, that means, on the one hand, carrying out repairs and helping our counterparts in the countries concerned, but it also, above all, means preventing these things from happening again, and that I also ask you to do in future.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, the Italian Presidency's programme is not really available. I had to download it from the web and read it in English this morning. Fortunately, I understand English, but I regret that I do not understand Italian. But I would not have needed very much English to read what I found in your programme about environmental policy, because there was not really anything to read. You said a few nice friendly things that could easily have been copied from a daily paper. As you referred to the Lisbon process, I would like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office, whether you are aware that the Lisbon process calls for sustainability and environmental measures to be incorporated into all other areas of policy? If you are aware of that, could you please tell me how you intend to achieve it? I would also be grateful if you could confirm that your government has issued a paper entitled Environment as an Opportunity
, which envisages that the Italian Presidency should use these six months to limit EU environmental legislation and downgrade it. If that is correct, Mr Berlusconi, I presume that you will have the paper pulped immediately and condemn it as being illegal. I would also be grateful if you could tell me whether you will use your presidency to ensure that existing EU legislation is transposed into Italian law, as in the case of environmental impact assessment, for instance. I would be grateful if you could tell us, Mr Berlusconi, whether people who do not comply with that legislation will be the subject of criminal prosecution, because non-compliance is an offence, and I also call on the Commission to take appropriate action if it is aware of such non-compliance. Lastly, Mr Berlusconi, I would be grateful if you could tell me if during your presidency you will also be pursuing the environmental legislation for which you will be responsible, and in particular whether environmental responsibility will be on the agenda during your presidency. I would be grateful if you could explain how you intend to take that forward.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are not debating today whether gene technology has a right to exist in this world. Neither are we discussing whether it is right for there to be genetically modified food in the USA, Mexico, Canada or Europe. There already is. Had we not wanted this, we would have had to take action around twenty years ago and conclude a worldwide agreement. We did not do so. This means that we now have to ensure that we put a legal framework in place. What should the legal framework contain? It needs to state that there is research and that a product shall be completely safe and harmless according to current scientific knowledge. What we expect of any food colouring and any emulsifier in yoghurt is also what we expect of genetically modified food and seed, no more and no less. We have repeatedly said that it will take a package of measures to assemble a reasonable body of legislation in the European Union. The first part was Mr Bowe's report on the release directive several years ago. It was always, however, clear to us that this was not enough, that something more was needed in addition to the release of food, seed or plants. What is actually needed is for the processed plants to be labelled so that the people of the European Union have freedom of choice, which incidentally they also have in respect of any other foodstuff, for example with the fat content of milk or with other foods. They should be able to exercise their right to choose. No one has countered what has been said here by saying that genetically modified food is the work of the devil and no one is scaremongering. We simply say always that products have to be safe according to current scientific knowledge. We are trying to ensure that this is the case. And we are trying to ensure that food is comprehensively labelled. We have heard that a threshold is arbitrary and we know that this is the case. Whether it is 0.5% or 0.9% I really do not care. I would like us to have comprehensive legislation as quickly as possible and the reports by Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis are valuable and necessary contributions to achieving this. Then we will also have the security in the European Union of being able to say to the Americans and all of the others: yes, you can produce and export to the European Union, but on our conditions and in accordance with our legislation! We owe this to the people of the European Union; that is our job as their elected representatives. (Applause)

 Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to be able to catch your eye. I have just one question for the Commissioners. Do you not think that there is a certain contradiction inherent in the recommendations? If you are in favour of more incentives for research in order to get better medicines to the patients more quickly, and if all the G10 countries have said so too, then why does it appear from the policy agreement on the pharmaceuticals package as if the provision being made for data protection, as regards the creation of a return on innovations, is insufficiently long-term, so that research is not being driven forward? Do you not also think that the safest and best way of providing patients quickly with better medicines would, in principle, be a fast and simple central procedure, and that it would be better if the Commission and the Member States were to hand out more money for research projects and at last get round to submitting the new legislation on children’s medicines to Parliament? That would enable us to do something more quickly about getting people better medicines.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – (DE
) Mr President, I do indeed have an objection to make to this. That this House takes lawmaking seriously and treats it as being important is good practice. You will be aware that, tomorrow, as the Conference of Presidents has decided in its wisdom, we will first be having an associated second-reading debate on genetically-modified food and traceability, followed by a joint debate on food legislation, part of which will be on a second reading, and then there will be other debates, also on second readings. Without wishing to belittle the oral question put by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I am convinced that the order of debate proposed by the Conference of Presidents was the right one. I sympathise with the Commission, which evidently has organisational problems, and I am sure – indeed, I have absolute confidence – that it can sort these organisational problems out, and that it will be in a position later in the day to give an answer to this question.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your report from the Council and I am well aware that messengers, or bringers of bad news, should not be shot, which is why that is far from my mind. Nevertheless, I do admit that I found the results of this Extraordinary Council meeting very disappointing, if we consider that where SARS is concerned all we have are questions. This is an unknown virus. We do not really know what the routes of infection are. We do not know of any way of treating it, and we do not really know anything about the mortality rate. There are so many questions that the debate about a centre is just a distraction. I may be happy to discuss it in six months' time, but at the moment that is a course of action that glosses over and covers up what is really necessary. I feel exactly the same when I hear that the Member States have had a constructive exchange of views and are responsible for taking preventive measures. This is something that we have to change. It is high time that there was a Community competence for health policy, and I mean in the Treaty. If we do not recognise that now then I do not know when we will. We ought to have realised this even in the days of BSE. Much of what I am hearing today and have heard in the past is familiar to me: the economic impact – we said that too in the days of BSE. In the Minutes it says not to talk out loud about the dangers of BSE because heaven knows what economic consequences it will have. What consequences did it have in the end? What I would have liked from the Council is for it to have done something practical for once. Incidentally, I would have liked to see the Commission do the same. Mrs Schreyer, I regret having to say this to you; I know that you are not responsible for this. I will repeat it to Mr Byrne; indeed, I have already said as much to him in this House. It is not acceptable for Mr Byrne to say, yes, research funding is a tricky one, the funds are tied up for such a long time. He should have gone straight to the Commission and said: come on then, chop-chop, release funds from the research framework programme, and do it now! We need money for research immediately, so that we can get things moving and mobilise all of our researchers so that we can establish what kind of a virus it is, whether it is possible to treat it and what vaccines are available. The Member States ought to have done exactly the same. When they were dispersing last week after the extraordinary meeting of the Council, I would have expected them to say: each of us is committed to putting x% or so many hundreds of thousands of euros on the table straight away for research. I should like to make another unpopular statement: why are we not talking about restricting travel? Other countries are doing that. There are countries that have introduced entry restrictions. Why are we not doing so? Why are planes from my German airline and other airlines still able to travel around all over the place? We do not know anything about the infection channels. We have no idea how long the incubation period is. Is that as it should be? Why are we not having an honest discussion about quarantining? I think it would be responsible to do so, and I think that what the Member States have done and also what the Commission has done is both insufficient and irresponsible. I am denouncing that here and I would like you – that is those who bear the responsibility for this – to justify it to the people of Europe. (Applause)
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 Mr President, I fear that I must disappoint Mr Trakatellis, something that is relatively easy when he hopes that the members of the Convention are now listening and will suddenly start regarding health policy as a priority. I do not believe that they will. Having listened attentively to Mr Byrne and Mr Trakatellis, I agree with them, and, whilst much of what they have referred to is of course necessary, what we have done so far is not enough. The European system for the epidemiological monitoring and control of communicable diseases that we already have can only be as good, in terms of quality, reliability and speed, as the national systems, and these differ in every respect. That is why I agree with you that we should set up a scientific research centre. That, though, will be but a drop in the ocean. I am sure that you, Mr Trakatellis, want more research, and equally sure that Mrs Malliori will endorse that, but that is not what we really need. The European Union has hitherto specifically excluded the possibility of harmonising legislation. It is specifically laid down in our system for combating communicable diseases that national legislation will not be harmonised. You stated earlier, Commissioner, that the most important thing now is prevention, that we must, for example, reduce encounters with certain diseases and exposure to them. What about if plague returns to Europe or breaks out again anywhere? What about if polio, infantile paralysis, again becomes widespread? Are we prepared for those eventualities? I can tell you plainly that, no, we are not prepared. An epidemiological system that results, for example, in it being recommended in some countries – but not in others – that one should not travel to certain regions, and in observation being carried out at airports in some European Union countries, but with nothing of the kind being done in others, is no use whatever. So I have to tell you, very plainly, that the only thing we have to do – although we all have to agree on it – is to incorporate in the Treaty a competence for health policy. Mr Trakatellis, I would be the first to applaud enthusiastically if you were to get your group to accept that. I have not read any great number of statements on the Convention in which that desire was expressed, and I am quite certain that Mrs Grossetête has not either, but as for you, Mr Poettering – and I see that you are listening – do you say that there has to be a Community competence for health policy? We are eager to find out! It might well not have done so at the highest level, but my group has clearly stated that we want no more centres serving as alibis. The European Union is meant to have proper competences to deal with such problems. What will we be saying to people at next year's European elections? Do we really have equal standards – at least minimum standards – of hygiene, which enable us to fight disease and beat it? You asked, Mr Trakatellis, whether people in hospitals can get even more ill. They can indeed, because we have no comparability between hospitals' standards of hygiene. Is that the European Union that we want our citizens to live in? No! We want not just competition and the internal market, but also social security and health care. So far, we have not achieved them. If we now take this case, of SARS, as an example and want to make something of it, we must succeed in gaining a mandatory competence at European Union level for health policy. I ask you, Mr Byrne, as a matter of urgency, to support us in this and bring our need for a Community competence to the ears of the Commission and Mr Prodi – who has always told us that he has an ear open to the soul of the people, something that the examples of the European Food Agency and the Food Safety Authority have brought to our notice. Mr Byrne, I will support you if, in the forthcoming Budget debates, you demand more personnel and double your budget estimate. When it comes to summoning up the courage to do that, though, you are on your own. (Applause)

 Mr President, you are right to say that today sees the third reading of the report on cosmetics, a topic to which – as will be known to most of us – Parliament has now been repeatedly returning over the space of ten years. By far and away most of the proposals, both in this parliamentary session and in the last one, concern themselves with a ban on experiments on animals and on the sale of products tested on animals. These areas have been the subject of the most controversy, and, indeed, still are. Both within the European Union and outside it, the most controversial issue was about whether experiments on animals would continue to be permitted in the future in connection with toothpaste and shampoos. Controversy continued to rage around the issue of whether a product that had been tested on animals could still be sold. It was said over and over again in this House that the only way to prevent tests being exported was to couple a ban on testing with a ban on the marketing – and hence the sale – of the products. Both in the first and second readings of this seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive, that was the crucial issue, but, both in the competent committee and here in this House, we made the point that cosmetics and cosmetic products are of immediate relevance to the protection of consumers. We pointed out that, for example, the information on a product's useful life was of importance to consumers, who were to be told for how long they could use a cosmetic product once it had been opened. That was one of the points on which this House made proposals at first and second reading. This House's final demand – one that I was happy to endorse as rapporteur – was that hazardous products, those known to be carcinogenic, to affect the reproductive system or to be mutagenic, should not be permitted to be used in cosmetics. These proposals were what, in essence, our second reading was about. All of them gave rise to controversy. Although they passed through second reading by a very large majority, the Commission did not exactly welcome us with open arms. Today, though, at third reading, we can permit ourselves some self-congratulation, because the conciliation procedure was, I have to say, difficult. Over the years, I have had direct or indirect experience of many conciliation procedures. In this one, I started out uncertain as to whether we would achieve a compromise. We did. The outcome is that a ban on testing cosmetics on animals will be in place – six years after the legislation is adopted. There will be a sales ban on most of the products still containing ingredients tested on animals – six years after the legislation is adopted. We have also said that there will be a derogation for three tests, the development of alternatives to which is not yet in sight. The cosmetics industry is not entirely blameless in this. That so little has been done to develop these tests is partly due to the cosmetics industry having been, in the past, what we might call dozy. But we are now giving them an incentive, and a certain amount of time, to come up with alternatives. Let me make it clear that what we have achieved is a compromise, a compromise which, like all others, is not ideal. I am aware that the cosmetics industry finds it less than ideal, and also that the animal welfare organisations are convinced that more could have been achieved. I have had to keep on telling our friends in the animal welfare organisations that if they can find someone who can achieve more, they should get them down here and let them get on with it. My fellow-Members and I have tried to get a workable solution accepted, and so let me conclude by saying that I am grateful to the outgoing Danish Presidency, whose cooperation with us has been excellent, and also to the Commission, which had become cooperative by the end. Mr Liikanen, I wish it had done so a bit sooner, but at least it was never too late. I will also express my thanks to our colleagues in the Conciliation Committee, and to all those with whom we dealt during the conciliation procedure. This all adds up to one of the reasons why I love this Parliament so much, and why I would not wish to be a member of any other. The cooperation between Members of every nation and political group was open, decorous, frank and supportive to such an extent that I am convinced that you will not find the like of it in any legislature in the world. It was a joy to work through the night with you until twenty past four in the morning. It was a joy to achieve this outcome and to have been allowed to be your rapporteur. So I again want to thank most especially the colleagues who have always, and repeatedly, assured me of their support, even when conditions were rather less favourable on every side. (Applause)

 Madam President, I must admit to being rather moved, for not even in this House is this amount of praise and appreciation to be reckoned with. I admit to enjoying it, for politicians do not often come in for praise, at any rate not with such frequency and regularity. It has made me feel good, but I have already tried to pass this praise back. Thank you for the debate, which I hope will turn out to be the last on this topic in this House; you have heard, Mr Liikanen, that it will be your future task to monitor how progress is made. It will be your task to see to it, along with your fellow Commissioner Mr Busquin, that the European Community's Joint Research Centre has sufficient resources to evaluate the alternatives that will then come into existence. Your mission is to drive industry onward, support it and, in tandem with it, to ensure that alternatives are developed quickly and equally quickly accepted. This is something we must do together. Commissioner, you have heard today a message that will surely get through to the cosmetics industry and the Member States too: we will be very vigilant as regards how the timetable is kept to, and that this time there really will be the cut-off point of which Mr Florenz and others spoke earlier. I would rather not hear anything further said on this subject in this House. My wish is that there should now be a timetable, one that might even now be complied with even more promptly, and that that should draw a line under the subject. Please let me conclude by again saying ‘thank you’ – that is why I wanted to say a final word. Not to you, though, ladies and gentlemen, for I have thanked you already. I would like to thank those without whom I could not have carried on this work – first and foremost my assistant Mrs Annika Nowak, who is probably sitting listening to this in my office, and who knows this dossier better than I do, but also especially the Secretariat of the Conciliation Committee. Parliament has good staff; some of them are more than just good, and the Conciliation Committee Secretariat, sitting over there today, has certainly had the most work to do, far more than I have had myself. Let me now – yes, this really is the end! – say ‘thank you’ to Mrs Kerry Postlewhite, one of my group's staff, who, throughout the last few years has advised me and been of use to me in my capacity as group leader and rapporteur, and without whom I would not have been able to keep my feet on the ground. Today is probably the last time she will sit here in the plenary, as she is soon to take up other duties, and, whilst I am saddened by this, I know she will be doing something new that she will like and that will be a joy to her. I have no idea how the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I are supposed to work without her. Anyway, we will give it a try. She is here working on one of her briefs for the last time, and so my final and especial thanks must go to Mrs Kerry Postlewhite. Thank you for the debate, and I hope that the vote, which is about to take place, will go well.

 Mr President, I would like to thank those of the Commissioners who, out of respect for Parliament and the debate on the work programme, have been able to spend a couple of hours with us – once a year. I admire Mrs de Palacio for answering questions across all areas of policy, including those of her colleagues who have other priorities. What I have said amounts to praise for those of her colleagues who are actually here. Mrs de Palacio, Commissioners, I have read the work programme very carefully. It is better than what you have usually come up with. In my areas of interest at least, it is more helpful. You have integrated the concept of sustainability throughout, as we have always requested. I really get the impression that you have done your homework, that you have understood the issues and that the external presentation at least has been very well done. ‘External presentation’ and ‘internal behaviour’ are, however, two very different things. My queries relate in particular to internal behaviour. Let us consider the leftovers, that is to say the things you are carrying forward from 2002. In my field, which is environmental policy, there are some areas that Mrs Schörling and Mrs Frassoni and others have touched upon, such as policy on chemical products, PVC, the batteries directive, and various others. If I consider why that is, I see that one of the main problem areas is that you cannot achieve any internal agreement. You have conflicts between environmental, industrial and trade policy, and there is also often conflict between consumer protection and trade policy. If you cannot resolve these internal conflicts, if you cannot manage to demonstrate leadership and say 'OK, the Commissioner responsible has power over the inter-service procedure', then we will always find ourselves with ‘leftovers’. That is why I am asking you, Mrs de Palacio, how you intend to resolve conflicts within the Commission in future, and whether you are willing to air these conflicts in a more open and transparent way. We can only ever guess the reasons why no proposals are presented to us. We learn them already from the grapevine and the rumour mill. We mostly seek answers in Commissioner Liikanen's areas of responsibility, sometimes, often enough in fact, we seek them in Commissioner Lamy's areas, and sometimes in Commissioner Bolkestein's areas too. I regard them as being the naughty boys. I am not referring to poor Commissioner Wallström and Commissioner Byrne, who always do their best but are sometimes pushed to one side. I expect your internal behaviour to reflect the way you present things externally. That means that you will also present the proposals that you have presented to us very quickly in future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is actually a technical measure. The resolution before you, on which we are to vote, refers to what we term comitology, something which the spectators in the galleries will be surprised to learn, many Members of this House have difficulty understanding, and indeed, they certainly do not have to. It is comitology that entitles the Commission to use the specialist committees to approximate legislation within the scope of the power that the legislation itself confers. The resolution passed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy charges the Commission with now desiring to avail itself of a right which it does not possess. What we are talking about is the Commission's intention of deferring the entry into force of the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, which was actually meant to have happened some time ago. In the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, Parliament decided on a ban on the marketing of cosmetics that had been tested on animals, sharing as it did the conviction of most of the public that we have enough cosmetics and do not need more – toothpaste, shower gel, and so on – for which animals have had to suffer and die. This ban had a definite deadline – 1998. In 1997, the Commission gave itself the power to delay its entry into force. Whilst, admittedly, stating that the entry into force was to be in 2000, it added, at the same time, the option of an extension of two years. I do not want right now to state whether that was lawful. As things stood, the marketing ban was meant to enter into force on 30 June 2002, and it did so. The Commission is now planning to use a comitological measure to again, very soon – in a week or a few days, quite possibly on 24 September – put back the date of entry into force, by six months. This it justifies by the assertion that we are in the midst of the conciliation procedure on the seventh amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, and that the measure could therefore not enter into force in June. Mrs Wallström, I am sorry that you are the member of the Commission to whom I must say these things. We charge you with acting illegally, with breaking the law. You are in breach of the Treaty and of existing legislation! I would much rather say that to Mr Liikanen, but he is, unfortunately, not here today. I am aware that the Commission acts as a collegiate body; I am equally aware that there are individuals sitting on the Commission who have very different views. That, Mrs Wallström, is why I regret that it is you whom I have to address today. I would very much prefer to have been very hard on Mr Liikanen. I admit that, with you sitting there, I find it more difficult. Nonetheless, what you are doing is illegal! It is against the law, and we will therefore be taking you to the Court of Justice if necessary. I am sure that the majority in this House will support that. What you are now proposing to do is not merely contrary to the law, but is positively absurd. I could use old-fashioned language and call it daft! You want to pass a measure with retroactive effect. You want to pass something that enters into force retroactively, namely from 30 June. Why, actually, do you want to do this? We are already at the end of September. The conciliation procedure will be completed in two months at the latest – it has to be. Even now, you have not implemented the marketing ban. In theory, you are already acting illegally, but we are saying: OK, that's something of a legal vacuum, we'll put up with it. The Member States are not proceeding with transposition, and we know that they are doing the right thing by waiting for the seventh amendment. What the Commission now has in mind is the creation of a precedent, and we are not going to let them get one past us. They want, again, to give themselves the right to defer the sixth amendment, and if we now lie down quietly like little lambs, then they will believe that they have the right to carry on doing the same thing. We will not let you have your precedent! We are not good little lambs! I'm not one, and nor are my fellow MEPs! That is why we are telling you now that your actions are illegal. This resolution makes that very clear. We call upon you not to implement this measure. The four articles are very clear in calling on you to desist. We are telling you to keep your hands off this measure. We are telling the Member States not to touch it, not to pass it into law. And we are telling you that if you do it anyway, we will drag you off to the Court of Justice! Mrs Wallström, I really do beg you to take this message back to the Commission. I can see the gentleman from the Industry Directorate-General sitting beside you. Tell them that we are serious about this. We believe that you are in breach of the law! As the Commission, you may not break the law. You know that it did not do past Commissions any good, and you too should act as properly and honestly as possible. You are not doing that if you want to pass another Implementing Measure. So, as rapporteur for the Cosmetics Directive, I can only tell you, as firmly as I can: hands off! (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Martin has just told me that I have the luxury of being able to be somewhat flexible, rather than, as is otherwise the case, having only one and a half, two, or three minutes at my disposal. I promise my colleagues, though, especially Mr Casaca, who is to explain the next report, that I will not exploit that advantage. Mr President, I am glad that it is you who are currently in the chair, as you are also chairing the conciliation procedure on cosmetics and are as helpful a guide as one could wish to have in the conciliation procedure. I therefore take great pleasure in seeing you here today. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate. Our discussion today has not only been a very lively one, as our discussions frequently are, but has also been able to evoke some enthusiasm from the visitors in the gallery, as shown by their applause, which is admittedly unusual, but also gratifying. I just want to return to one point and not so much correct Mrs Flemming as just add to what she said, so that our male visitors can be aware that it is of relevance to them, too: the Cosmetics Directive that we are discussing today is not just about anti-wrinkle creams – which I, at the age of 49 and working in Parliament, urgently need – but it is also particularly relevant to deodorants, shampoos, aftershave, toothpaste, soap – which all of us here today use on a daily basis. The subject we are dealing with today, namely the issue of whether animals should be made to suffer for the sake of these products, is of concern to all of us irrespective of gender. It is obvious that lipsticks and anti-wrinkle creams are always particularly useful for making points and adding emphasis. I thank you for your support. The past years have seen us working very closely together, which has involved the blurring of group boundaries. We had elections in my country on Sunday, and election campaigns tend to polarise in order to emphasise differences. Perhaps I should do that better in this House, but I am unable to. I can only thank my fellow Members from other groups for their help and support, notably Mrs García-Orcoyen, who, along with Mrs Flemming, is doing most of the PPE group's work on this issue; I could not, in fact, ask for greater support from an opposing group. In this area, we are guided by the facts. But what I must also say, addressing the other Members here, is that we have always reached compromises. We have sought compromise among ourselves, a point I make for the benefit of, among others, Mr Bernié, who is perhaps not yet fully convinced, but has not yet been in Parliament that long, and is not so long-acquainted with the subject. Of course we are considering the industry's interests. Of course we said, as long ago as 1993, that the industry still had almost ten years. Even now, with the seventh amendment, a legal amendment, under discussion in the conciliation procedure at this moment, we are reiterating that the industry, once this legislation is adopted, will have five years to go before there is an absolute ban on animal experiments and a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals – and then another five years for certain special tests, the development of alternatives to which we can assume will take even longer. How more accommodating can one be? Of course, there have to be incentives for the industry and a certain amount of pressure still has to be exerted to get money invested in finding alternatives, as otherwise the money will be paid out only to the directors when we believe it could also be invested in science. I will now again address the Commission, Mrs Wallström and the ladies and gentlemen from the Industry Directorate-General, who are at the moment engaged in conversation but doubtless have an idea of what I want to say to them. Mrs Wallström said earlier, in a response that certainly cannot have been easy for her, that the Commission is trying to get the best result. If you are really trying to get the best result, then there are two things you have to do. For a start, you should tell Mr Liikanen that he should get round to at last coming up with a proposal that might help bring about a compromise in the conciliation procedure, and that he should not block Parliament's decisions. You will be aware that, a few months ago, Parliament, by a massive majority of nearly 500 votes, decided in favour of these marketing bans, or to put it another way, sales prohibitions for cosmetics. To date, the Commission and Mr Liikanen's Directorate-General have been blocking them, and so I ask you, Mrs Wallström, to inform Mr Liikanen, and also the new Director-General, Mr Mingasson, that France is not the only country to have a cosmetics industry, but that there are other interests to consider and that Europe has a Parliament, and he would be well-advised to accede to that Parliament's wishes. That is what I would like, but I have not seen it happen yet. If the Commission wants to take seriously its role as mediator in the conciliation procedure, then let it make a proposal that meets Parliament halfway. I furthermore call on you to inform the Member States – I'm sorry, but can I point out to the gentleman from Directorate-General III that it really would be helpful if you were to let Mrs Wallström listen for a bit? Yes, I am happy to wait a moment. I am capable of quite a few things, but not even I can listen to two people at once! So I call on you to inform the Member States that the marketing ban – and please note that it is an absolute one – has been in force since 30 June 2002, and that the Member States would be well advised to be rather more amenable, rather more flexible and a bit less obstinate in the conciliation procedure. If the Commission wants to be helpful, Mrs Wallström, then you can tell the Member States that they have two options: one is to be helpful to the conciliation procedure, and then your cosmetics industry will get another five years added on to the five it has already got. Alternatively, you can be unhelpful and keep on blocking as you are doing at the moment, and then you will have a marketing ban dating back to 30 June. The Commission's task is to convey that information to you. My request to you is really very firm, and is meant in earnest, although without it being intended to have any threatening undertone, but it would poison cooperation with Parliament and do it serious damage, if you were to have recourse to this comitological measure. It is unnecessary, and we would interpret it as an affront and as a breach of the law. Three months after it took effect, you would again resort to a comitological measure for another two months; any person with a normal mind would find that ridiculous. Even the Commission knows that it is ridiculous, and is trying to dupe Parliament, to create a precedent, and that is how we too see things. That is what you have heard today. I would be obliged to you if, having heard all the Members of this House, you would tell that to Mr Liikanen as well. We consider it an affront to Parliament, and a breach of the law which we would punish by taking it to the Court of Justice, and I ask you to help the conciliation procedure, support Parliament, and help me and the Members of this House, whom I again thank for their support, in the conciliation procedure rather than using comitological measures to make our cooperation more difficult. Thank you.

 Mr President, over the past few years – since 1996, I would say – I have told this House at least five times that animal feed should not be a dustbin for cheaply disposing of all kinds of rubbish. It is surprising to find that such a simple statement never ceases to be topical and is never a source of boredom, given that it remains so topical. Why should that be? Because of our agricultural policy, of course. Since we try to produce everything as cheaply as possible, it makes sense to produce cattle feed as cheaply as possible too. I once said that the manufacturers and we ourselves should try to picture sitting down in front of a plate of animal feed with a knife and fork on either side – just imagine what that would look like! Mr Bowis just pointed out that this is not just a matter of carelessness here but of criminal intent. He is quite right. To describe storing animal feed in a former chemical works as carelessness is to put it mildly. I do not know what makes people do things like that or allow them to happen. What are we to think when a waste disposal company produces glucose syrup as a parallel activity? Should we not perhaps be somewhat sceptical when we come across an Irish company wanting to dispose of its waste – to which there can be no objections as such – and we see that it wants to do this in Belgium and that the waste reprocessing company also produces glucose syrup? The waste that it is processing comes from washing the coating on contraceptive pills, which of course contains sugar. No one actually noticed this and we all found it quite normal, but when it actually came to light in the course of the monitoring process it caused enormous excitement. If we do not start to change the system in some way, we will carry on having this debate here at least three times a year. So what can we change about the system? I am grateful to Commissioner Byrne for pinpointing some ideas. Yes, we need tough legislation on feed hygiene. Yes, we need to separate the production of animal and plant-based feeds. Yes, we need stricter approval procedures for feed producers, with a registration system for factories producing animal feeds. And yes, every manufacturer of feedingstuffs must employ a biochemist at his plant full-time and not just source one from somewhere else. These are all commonplace ideas that we could all suggest, of course. What is the situation with legislation on waste? Yes, there is indeed proper waste legislation. Are there proper controls in the Member States? Apparently neither the country of origin nor the receiving country carries out controls. Will the Commission go to the European Court of Justice more quickly? Will countries which are obviously ignoring their control obligations under the existing legislation be prosecuted more quickly and suffer appropriate penalties? What is the position as regards controls in the Member States? Since the BSE crisis, we have established that the real Bermuda Triangle within the European Union is the system of controls in the Member States. We should be obliging all Member States to, at last, make the process more transparent and to tell us how many people are carrying out controls on what, when, where and with what result. That can just be one page, nice and transparent, available to anyone, and on the Internet if you like. Is that too much to ask? No, it is not too much to ask! We have been saying for years – since 1996 – that we want a positive list of substances and additives in animal feed. Commissioner Byrne told us that the feasibility study is almost complete, so we should be able to start soon. I am grateful for that. However, if we do not all accept that up to now we have been consistently turning a blind eye so that animal feed can be produced cheaply and so that meat can be produced cheaply, then we will still be encouraging firms to dump all kinds of waste, anything that can no longer be recycled in any other way, in animal feed. That is why we need to have quality requirements for animal feeds. We need to have other controls on animal protein. And in our role as consumers, we ourselves also need to consider what we are consuming and how, and what we are willing to pay for products. (Applause)

Mr President, I hope we will manage today to conclude a legislative process that was first discussed in Parliament a number of years ago. This legislation is, of course, concerned with the protection of health, and we all naturally want cosmetic products – soaps, shampoos, perfumes – to be healthy, which means not presenting any hazard to the people who use them. All Members of this House have a natural interest in making the European cosmetics industry competitive and keeping it that way. We have, of course, always borne in mind that jobs are tied in with the manufacture of cosmetics and that these jobs deserve to be safeguarded. Presenting as rapporteur the committee's second reading to Parliament today, I can tell you that the committee adopted it by 44 votes in favour, with two abstentions, that is to say, with a very, very large majority right across all the political groups. That is the way we want it. What do we want to achieve here today? We want this second reading to alter the Council's Common Position, which is poor, feeble, and far from forward-looking. The Ministers of the Member States, assembled in Council, have missed their chance to set a course and also to hear what their peoples want. What, then, do the people of Europe want? If you were to conduct a survey, it is likely that you would, in many countries, hear very diverse opinions. Most, though, would agree that there is a sufficient choice of soaps, deodorants, perfumes, and lipsticks. We do not need hundreds and thousands of them if animals have to undergo lengthy torture to produce them. So let there be a stop to animal experiments in the field of cosmetics. You would certainly find an overwhelming majority of the public in favour of that, and in Parliament as well. Right, we said in the committee second reading, let there be no more animal experiments in the field of cosmetics. We also go even further and say that, from a certain point, sales of cosmetics tested on animals must cease. We are convinced that this is the only way that we will step up pressure in favour of alternative methods of testing and on the search for tests in which animals are not tortured, in which animals do not have to suffer. What do we want in addition to that? We want perfumed ingredients that bring out allergic reactions in people and are recognised by experts as allergenic, to be indicated on labels. Not in the least do we want to ban them. We want them to be labelled so that people with allergies can make their choice. We also want consumers to be better able to ascertain how long cosmetics will last, so that they know, when they open a cosmetic or a sun cream, whether they will be able to use the product next year or whether it will have become harmful to health or have lost its effectiveness. All groups in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy were very much of one mind on these various proposals. I hope that, when we vote at noon today, we too will be united in an overwhelming majority that will show the Council how very poor we consider its Common Position to be. I would have liked the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen to have been a bit more courageous and not waited for an absolute majority at second reading in Parliament to force them to change their mind. I would have liked the Commission to have demonstrated a bit more flexibility and courage on some points, as, in my experience, Mr Liikanen otherwise usually does. I hope that we here are at least in agreement that this partnership works. I would now also like to say something about this partnership. There is indeed a great deal of disagreement in this House, and some of us still maintain that disagreements are a good thing, in that they make clear to the public the differences between us and the reasons why they should vote for one party or for another. I must admit that I am, at the moment, more concerned about the matter in hand. I am very grateful to members of the other groups for their cooperation, which has been extremely fair and thoroughly accommodating. Looking up at the representatives of the cosmetics industry, who are sitting up in the gallery and waiting with understandable interest to see what is to be decided today, I can only say that I value the largely fair cooperation afforded by the cosmetics industry, who have an important stake in these matters, and I know that constructive cooperation also builds trust. All the bodies which have played their part so far – Parliament, industry, consumers' organisations, and also the organisations representing people with allergies – are convinced that Parliament, today at noon, will have a unique chance to at last enact a law that will, in a couple of years, activate legislation that people want and need. I hope that, at noon today, we will be courageous enough to show this to the Council and the Commission by an overwhelming majority. My dear colleagues in other groups, you will have my support in doing so. I hope that I will also have yours. We will confirm this today and, if necessary, in a conciliation procedure.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

rapporteur
. – (DE) 
Mr President, I thank you for giving me an opportunity at the end of the debate to express my gratitude for the way it has gone. It has been a very lively debate, characterised by emotion and level-headedness, and touching on various points. For that I am very grateful to the Members of this House who have spoken. I am grateful to Mrs Flemming for making me aware of what Leonardo da Vinci said, and I have been constantly trying to think up points of similarity between him and Mr Liikanen, who, when he responds, will perhaps astonish us by telling us that the two of them have much in common and that he, in the depths of his heart, actually has great sympathy with Parliament's proposal. I am very grateful to all the Members who have supported me and a similar number of whom will, I hope, support the proposals when we vote at noon today. Should cosmetic amendments – and ‘cosmetic’ is the appropriate word – be necessary, I am convinced that we will have to make them in the course of the conciliation procedure. I would like to briefly address the points made by Mr Nobilia and, at the end, Mrs Jackson. I have to tell Mrs Jackson that I could not withdraw the amendments even if I wanted to, because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had adopted them with 44 votes in their favour. It has therefore now become the Committee's position and not just my own, and I have to make a true and faithful report of that to Parliament. I would like to say in addition that I am a lawyer rather than a natural scientist, and so I have done something very simple. I have borrowed the position of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology, composed of European Union scientists, who have established that 26 substances result in allergic reactions, 13 of them to a severe degree. That labels should indicate the presence of these substances I find the most utterly obvious thing in the world. We have labels for nuts in chocolate and everything else for people who suffer from allergies, and we have to have labels for this as well. The aromatic oils industry having belatedly woken up to this, I can well understand why, three days before the vote, it was trying to influence us. I do not want to ban its products, but I do want the substances listed, in one language rather than in eleven, and with their chemical names, in the list of ingredients, which is, incidentally, what the Scientific Committee on Cosmetics proposed. It is my conviction that we owe that to the European Union's consumers.

Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Mr President, I have learned the wisdom and educational value of tempering criticism with praise. For this reason, Commissioner De Palacio, let me begin with a word of praise. It is gratifying that we have finally managed to engage in a very early and timely debate on a strategic plan and that this dialogue between the Commission and Parliament and the specialised committee within Parliament has been launched in sufficiently good time. I refer expressly to these two institutions, because the role of the Council, in my view, may be disregarded. In Barcelona, we saw that the Council sets its own agenda and does what it wants and acts as a higher-grade specialised council. That is why the dialogue between you, Commissioner De Palacio, as the representative of the Commission, and Parliament is the only one that counts in this context. And then comes the criticism, but I can even present that in a favourable light. Commissioner De Palacio, if you ever see a job vacancy that involves selling a defective product, apply for it. You would give it your best shot. You have tried to do your best for a document that I did not understand. I marvel at anyone who has read this document and understood the message that is locked within its sentences. I reflected on ways of sniffing something out of this text. Would a guide dog help? Or how about a Saint Bernard that can detect signs of life below an avalanche? Some kind of tracker dog is needed, Commissioner De Palacio. The Commission has managed to pepper this document with every conceivable reference. The term ‘consumer protection’ crops up, and the concept of sustainability pops up here, there and everywhere, wherever it can possibly be squeezed in – sustainable transport, a sustainable economy, sustainable everything. But the document did not reveal to me what you actually intend to do and what your priorities are. At no point could I grasp what your real priorities are. Yes, there is enlargement, and yes, there is sustainable economic growth, perhaps security and stability too. But how you intend to achieve these things, Commissioner De Palacio, is concealed beneath a veneer of ornate prose. So when you return to the Commission, tell your fellow Commissioners what we shall all no doubt be telling them personally: they need to do their homework better next year. The challenge for us as a Parliament is now to take this skeleton you have presented to us and flesh it out with meaningful substance. If this were a piece of schoolwork, it would be returned with the comment ‘A good effort, but improvement is needed for next time’. And that is my message to you.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, I must confess to being quite astonished! We are speaking about products that are on the market today and are asking why we need to provide evidence of their safety! I can tell you why: because it has to be done for every last bit of artificial colouring that goes into your Uncle Joe's Mintballs
 and for every preservative that is added to jam, and because we have always resolutely proclaimed in this forum that consumer safety is important. For this reason a product cannot be deemed marketable unless it can be proved safe and harmless. This is surely easy to demonstrate for any product that has already been on the market for some time. Moreover, I must also express my astonishment at the references to divergent systems. I do not know what you are talking about. I understood neither Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s reference to these divergences nor Mrs Jackson’s. In Germany you can go into any drugstore at all, into any supermarket, and you will be perfectly free to buy vitamins, calcium or whatever you want in various different dosages. I have nothing against that. Nor do I object to these products remaining freely obtainable. I do wish, however, to see the introduction of a maximum dose – yes, a maximum dose is something I do want to see. People like myself, for example, who have the misfortune to suffer from kidney stones, must not take too much Vitamin C, because it crystallises. People like me must also be careful with calcium, and we have to know these things. This is why labelling is needed; this is why safety is paramount. Anyone who stands up today like Patricia McKenna and says that the adoption of this directive would force products off the market is misleading people. I take no pleasure in saying this, Patricia, because our opinions often concur. It is not true that a single safe product will disappear from today’s market. All manufacturers must be able to demonstrate the safety of their products. Every single manufacturer must be able to do that. For each and every product we buy – for all our cosmetics, our pharmaceutical products, our artificial sweeteners – we expect proof of safety. And are we now saying that we do not expect the same for food supplements? Surely food manufacturers will then come along to us and say, ‘Why must we prove that our muesli bars are safe?’ And they would be right to do so. They would then be exempted in future too. At that point they could start making their products with genetically modified organisms and whatever else. Why should anyone then have to demonstrate the safety of any product? Goodness knows that I have been involved for long enough in matters of consumer protection in this House. I believe my reputation goes before me in that respect. I tell all the people who call me that none of the products they can now buy will be taken off the market. I shall ensure that they are informed in future about any product they buy and whether it is safe. It makes no difference to me whether the evidence has to be produced within 24 or 30 months, but the evidence must be produced. I congratulate Mrs Müller on her excellent report, which will have my unreserved support tomorrow. (Applause)
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Mr President, it is indeed a remarkable situation in which we find ourselves today. We are speaking about a second reading, which the rapporteur has prepared brilliantly, and I admire the way in which Mrs Paulsen has tried to navigate a course between Scylla and Charybdis, Scylla being the thirteen Member States that have accepted the common position, and Charybdis being the two that have not, namely Austria and Germany. Austria and Germany did not approve the common position for clear reasons. Austria has been undertaking schemes involving the composting of biomass and the use of biogases for energy production, schemes which would no longer be possible under the common position. Germany would be prevented from sterilising and reusing catering waste. When I listen to this debate today, and when I look back on the past few days, it surprises me that the United Kingdom, France and other countries accepted the common position. I have just heard Mr Goodwill saying that he and his group did not sign Compromise Amendment No 25, which I signed along with all the other compromise amendments. I signed them because they are compromises. The ideal world is different. I have a different conception of the ideal solution too. But among the sources of the compromise amendment are not only Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s Amendments Nos 10 and 1 but also Mr Whitehead’s amendment, which provided for a four-year transitional period. Mr Goodwill referred to fears in his country that foot and mouth disease had been caused by the use of pigswill as feed. To my knowledge, this has not been proved. Swine fever, yes, but as a cause of foot and mouth disease it is new to me. I had certainly heard this being mooted in the past, but that is only one aspect of the issue. Another point – and this is part of the compromise, Mr Goodwill – is that if I go back to my own Member State and say that there is a disposal problem with reheated cooking oil, they will tell me in Germany that this poses a dioxin problem which they refuse to contemplate. We must be very careful. This is a very fine line we are treading today, and we must avoid the mistakes of the past, when cost issues and disposal problems were often invoked to the detriment of animal health, and hence of human health too. If I say today that I can support our proposed compromise on catering waste, I must explain part of the background against which I make that statement. Nobody has been able to tell me what happens with catering waste in the other Member States. In Germany, there are modern high-performance facilities which undertake state-of-the-art sterilisation of catering waste then recycle it into animal feed. That is a fact. In other Member States no one can tell me what happens to it. Some say it is burned. Nobody really knows. No one knows the standards, and in private conversation any Member will admit that some of it ends up in landfill sites. That is precisely what we do not want. I should like to have a clear set of rules. In five years’ time, if we have legislation banning the recycling of catering waste for any purpose other than the production of biodiesel, so be it; that is what we shall do. But it must then apply to all Member States. At the moment, Germany, Austria and other countries are being penalised for their high standards. If I appeal tomorrow for us to support all the compromise amendments, I shall be doing so because they are compromises. I must then ask you to be fair and support the compromises too.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – Mr President, on a point of order. With all due respect I appreciate the decision the House has taken but this has not been a secret ballot. I know how all of my neighbouring colleagues have voted. I appreciate that if we want to have an open ballot we can do so, but then we should not pretend that we have been voting secretly. We should vote openly by a show of hands. That is my first point. Secondly, I should like to say to our colleagues in the PPE-DE Group that with all due respect, we could have used ballot papers in the same time as we have taken now. Perhaps we can now proceed in a way that is really secret.

Mr President, Prime Minister, you have, amongst the six priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, managed to say not one word on the protection of the environment. That is, I admit, a respectable achievement, indeed a transparent one. I have had to listen too often over the last twelve years to Presidents of the Council who, among their priorities at the outset of their presidency, announce things they cannot bring to pass. In this case, you do not even announce anything. I find that very frank, very transparent and very clear. I am very grateful to Mr Salafranca for bringing Groucho Marx into the discussion earlier on. I, too, was reminded of Groucho Marx when I listened to that speech, because I must admit that I found it more than grotesque. Groucho Marx represents the grotesque, and I find it more than grotesque that the Spanish Presidency of the Council, ten years after the Rio Summit and in the year of the Johannesburg World Summit, has nothing to say about the protection of the environment. Mr Aznar, it is not for your Ministry of the Environment to do that, it is for you to do it. Let me remind you that the last summit, the Summit in Gothenburg, called upon you, the European Council, to use your meeting in Barcelona in the first half of the year to check on what was still needed. You must, then, say something about emissions trading. You must say when you want to ratify the Kyoto protocol. You must, for example, say when you intend to implement the Sixth Environmental Action Programme's strategies for the various industry sectors. In no way is that a matter for the environmental authorities in your own country; it is a matter for you personally. We always consider it important to cooperate closely and well with the Council, and so, Mr Aznar, I offer you assistance should your government have need of it. I am perfectly ready to offer you all my group's suggestions – with all respect of course – as may be necessary to enable you to perform your duties at the beginning of the year. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the European Food Safety Authority today, there is one thing in particular that we need to say to the citizens of the European Union. That is that we are convinced even now, without this Food Safety Authority, that the food people in the European Union are consuming is safe. So safe, that I am convinced that it is among the safest in the world. However, if we believe that a food safety authority would have advantages and lead to improvements in the European Union, there must be good reasons for that. I would like to name three conditions that I believe need to be met to achieve such improvements. Mr Bowis and Mr Whitehead have already touched on these points. The first is the quality of the experts. It is not acceptable for people the Member States want to get rid of to be sent to this authority as experts and scientists. It is your job, Commissioner, to invite the Member States to send only the cream of the cream. Secondly, to secure improvements we need transparency and openness. Even more than the scientific committees, which have had a high degree of transparency since the BSE crisis, the Authority needs to ensure that it earns the people's trust. That means that it must be open and transparent in its activities. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Byrne, we need controls. It is also your job, the Commission's job, to convey to the Member States that supervision and control are the most basic tasks of the Member States, something you have criminally neglected in recent years. If we want to carry on guaranteeing safe food, and perhaps even safer food, if we want to win back the people's trust, then we can only do this by meeting these conditions and by tightening up controls. If we do that, the new Food Safety Authority will be a step forward for the European Union. I call on you, Commissioner, to make sure that is the case.

 Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Beazley on his excellent speech. Mr Prodi, I would like to thank you for making it clear here today that you will not be bringing forward any proposals to amend the constitutional position unless you have the consent of the European Parliament and without a clear vote by Parliament as a directly elected body. That is more than we have been told so far, and I am delighted about that. At the same time I would like to thank you for trying to clear up any misunderstandings. However, there are some things I am still not clear about. I hope that you will be able to deal with those in your reply as well. You said that fewer proposals would be emanating from the Commission. There can be no objection to that, as long as you can tell us how this new vacuum is to be filled, because you know – just as my fellow Members and I do – that the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice stipulated very clearly the legislative role of the European Parliament and the roles of the Commission and the Council. If you are now telling us that the Commission will be making fewer proposals, one of the implications of that is that you will be presenting framework proposals. If that is what you intend, Mr Prodi, then you will have to ensure that there is a call-back mechanism and a comitology reform. This is not just a drawback of the present system, as you just suggested, but rather an absolute necessity in the context of the ideas or proposals that you have for the future. No one in this House wants framework proposals, but if you want them, then you must make sure they go hand in hand with proper democratic measures that do not adversely affect Parliament's rights. You say that you want more modern measures such as voluntary commitments; no one in this House wants that. However, if you still want that, you will have to protect democratic rights within the European Union and ensure that there is an Interinstitutional Agreement that leaves the rights of Parliament, the Council and the Commission intact. You also said that the White Paper opens up the way for an interinstitutional debate. It certainly does that. But I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to state clearly before us that you do not intend to go back on the Treaties of Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam, and that you share the views of the majority of the Members of this House about what I have said. Not a single piece of legislation should go through without the European Parliament being involved. There should not be any voluntary agreements and there should not be any framework agreements unless democracy is protected. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Byrne, I disagree with you on one key point, namely that we cannot yet discuss the measures to be adopted once the current crisis has been brought under control. I take an entirely different view. I am convinced that if you do not start talking about tomorrow and the future now, while all the Member States are trembling at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, you will find that once everything has settled down, the Member States will all sit back and relax. So now is the time for you to adopt a different course of action. Now is the time, for example, to work actively with your colleague Mr Fischler to ensure that a follow-up system for sheep and pigs is introduced immediately, so that the premium payments are no longer coupled to specific transfer date provisions. It would no longer be necessary to move the sheep and pigs all round the European Union to ensure they can be counted at the right place at the right time when the money is available. But I also believe that you must finally take courage and throw a stone into the water. Why do you not say: live transports are banned? Every live transport must be granted an exemption. Why can animals not be transported after slaughter? Try it and see. Why do you not announce here and now that we need a different policy on disease? Sit down with the IOE in Paris and say: the international policy on animal diseases needs to be changed right away, together with all the other relevant partners in the IOE. And finally: tell us, what have you got against giraffes? Many people have asked me that question: what has the Commissioner got against giraffes? Why is he stopping the safari parks from vaccinating to prevent disease? Why is he making all the safari parks close down, or putting the fear of whatever disease into the zoos throughout the European Union, because we failed to pursue a decent disease prevention policy and all the animals suddenly have to be culled? So tell us, Mr Byrne: please tell us, what have you got against giraffes? Please be so kind, take the measures today. Be more courageous today, do not wait until tomorrow. (Applause)
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

rapporteur

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we adopt new legislation in this House we always assume that it will constitute an improvement on the current situation. That is why I, as rapporteur, also require the seventh amendment of the cosmetics directive to be an improvement on the status quo. And is it? This is what I am asking myself and also all of you. In response, many in this House will say with me: no it is not. The sixth amendment of the cosmetics directive, for which I also had the honour of being rapporteur some years ago, clearly provides, for example, that in a number of stages an absolute final date should be set for animal testing for cosmetics, a date after which no more animal testing should take place. I would ask that we all bear in mind that there are now more than 8 000 tested ingredients which people can use quite happily. Now, however, the question is: what happens with new ingredients? This test and marketing ban – in effect a sales ban – from the sixth amendment has been converted by the Commission into a straight ban on testing in the territory of the European Union. This therefore means that in the future, people will be able to carry out tests on animals quite easily, for as long as they wish, just a few kilometres further away. Now I am hearing from all sides – including from the Commission – how sympathetically and favourably they look upon my amendments, but that unfortunately they cannot accept them because there are trade-related issues preventing them from doing so. Is this true? No, it is not. No one is yet in a position to say which way the ruling would fall in a case before the World Trade Organisation because no case has yet been decided on the basis of the protection of animals and moral considerations. Whether the Commission's trade argument would carry weight at all is all the more questionable because recently, a few months ago, the United States itself decided in its Dog and Cat Fur Act to adopt laws which are based solely on animal protection and on the moral sensitivities of the population. That is why I would invite the Commission to be rather more plucky at this juncture and to make its political priorities clear. Mr Liikanen, you know how highly I esteem you, at this stage you really must nail your colours to the mast and declare your intention to do your political duty. Stand up to your colleague, Mr Lamy, and others, or explain to them that they are mistaken. What does ‘a marketing ban some time in the future’ mean? Of course, I am also starting from the assumption that the products are safe. I am not forcing anybody to spread an unsafe product on their skin or on their children's skin or even to brush their teeth with an unsafe toothpaste. I would never want this. That is why I wish to propose a way forward which I consider to be very reasonable and which was generously supported by many colleagues in the Committee. Yes, there should be a test ban. Yes, there should be a marketing ban – a sales ban – wherever there are alternatives which have already been evaluated. Some time later – five years in my amendment, perhaps even later – there should be a total sales ban. During this time, industry also has the chance to develop alternatives and to invest in research. In the intervening time there should then be a labelling system so that consumers know, and it is fair that they should, whether they are buying products which have been tested on animals. The seventh amendment should, of course, bring even more improvements. Can it really be the case that the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products in the European Union should ascertain that ingredients – fragrances – cause allergies and these fragrances not be indicated on the label? This is unacceptable. It contravenes the principles which we have in the European Union, namely that products must be safe, but also clearly identifiable and genuine. So they have to be labelled. What I am proposing is nothing more and nothing less. Surely it is also only right and proper for consumers in the European Union to know when they buy a product how long it can be kept for and how long the active ingredients will remain effective? For how long will the toothpaste still taste good and for how long will the perfume or the skin cream remain safe to use and not turn rancid? That is why I am proposing to this House, with the support of the Committee, that we develop a symbol and that the Commission prescribe a clear label to go with it for products with a durability of over 30 months. Once they have been opened, how long can they be kept? In my opinion, these are all proposals which improve the sixth amendment – that is why we are here after all – and which afford a better level of protection to consumers, but also keep them better informed and give them the right to choose. In the first reading of a piece of legislation this is definitely what we all want and what we should have. After all, we also need to go into the second reading with something to play for. I am convinced that not only consumers can be happy with this but also representatives of the cosmetics industry, even if they still give the impression that they are downtrodden and victimised. I think that, at the latest, after this reading and also after the second reading, they will recognise that we need to join forces and achieve a viable working relationship. I invite them to do so here and now.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, it is now my privilege to speak on behalf of my group and to have the opportunity to respond to a number of the points which have been made. Let me do so. I am the very first to vote only for safe products, not only on the European market but also worldwide. This is what I have done since entering this Parliament, in respect of foodstuffs but also cosmetics. Mr Nisticò, even after a sales ban, of course existing products should continue to be sold as products which are recognised as being safe. The only products which would no longer be sold would be those for which animal tests had been carried out after this cut-off date. Your Amendment No 42, Mr Nisticò, which concerns finished products, is already covered in the existing legislation. We have already discussed this in committee. Some colleagues, including in particular Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo and others, pointed out that we should also take the misgivings expressed by scientists seriously. Of course I wish to do so, and it is not my intention, John Bowis, to put any child, or even anyone older, at risk. I am simply convinced that with the ingredients which are available and have been tested we are already able, even today, to produce any toothpaste in the world and also, for me, any kind of lipstick, of which I am so fond. I also believe, however, that from a particular moment in time, whether it be after five years or, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, after ten years, as you propose, we need to say, no more. Either people use the ingredients now available or new ingredients are tested using alternative methods. If this is not possible then they will just have to take those which are already available. In the Committee Mr Davies ‘produced’ the philosophers' stone. He refuted a deadly argument. He said very clearly: in that case perhaps we need to re-examine the delimitation between cosmetics and pharmaceuticals if this new, fantastically important suncream protects us all from skin cancer. Good, the Committee has taken on board what you certainly have in mind, Mr Nisticò. Then, some people have said, but there are already tests. Yes, there are: artificial tissue is used for in vitro 
tests. There are very many experiments underway, and wherever you go – you have the best contacts, Mr Nisticò, but others too – listen to what the scientists are saying; they do not have enough money. Let us make money available for this under the sixth Framework Programme for research, but let us also invite industry to invest more in this than they have done to date. I should like to make one final point: if we decide on a test ban today, but also a marketing ban in a few years' time, we need to have a labelling system for the interim period. That is why I would invite all of you once again – and in particular my colleague and shadow rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrat) and European Democrats, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo – to take another look at Amendment No 39. This is the amendment which is of the greatest significance, in conjunction with other amendments of both yours and mine. Finally, colleagues, I should like to thank you for your very fair and constructive cooperation in the run up to our discussions in the Committee, during the vote in the Committee and also here in Parliament today.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Madam President, I am sorry. I did try to avoid this, but perhaps we should base our arguments on the facts and on the system of law in the European Union. In the context of the internal market we are obliged to work at harmonising legislation in the area of consumer protection too. That is exactly what we are doing with the present legislation, for which Mrs Müller is the rapporteur. We are harmonising existing legislation on food supplements in the Member States and one of the reasons why we are doing this is to protect consumers. The intention is not to overstep the competences of the European Parliament, and we are simply doing what we are doing in other areas. The Court of Justice will agree with us at all times. Anyone who today tries to postpone it and to get it taken off the agenda is doing so using invalid arguments.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

. – (DE) 
Mr President, I fully endorse what Mr Ferber has said. I do not intend to say anything about the plethora of proposals presented in my area, i.e. on environmental policy and consumer protection. I do not intend to say anything about them because I assume that half of them will not be implemented and the other half will be carried over to next year. A German reference would read: tries hard. But you would not want to use it to apply for another job, because you would not get it. When you talk of good governance, Mr Prodi, good governance also means self-assessment, evaluating your Commission and deciding what you have the time and staff to achieve. And while we are on the subject of good governance: what does good governance mean? What exactly is good governance? Is it transparency? Fine, Mr Prodi. We are all very keen on transparency, but is more involvement by interest groups selected by you and with which you alone negotiate more transparency? Not in my book. And what about cutting red tape, Mr Prodi. Yes, I am all for cutting red tape, including red tape between Commission services. I am also all for cutting red tape in Parliament – she says self-critically – but are voluntary undertakings towards industry the solution? Are they any faster? And who controls them? Who imposes sanctions when they do not function? Is that more democracy, I ask you? You, Mr Prodi, were selected by the Heads of Government and your appointment was confirmed by us. But we here in the European Parliament were elected – directly elected – by the citizens of the European Union. This European Parliament has, by definition, a central role in civil society, as you so nicely put it, and I trust that you too can see that from your understanding of democracy. I warn all of you in the Commission not to tinker with the crucial role of the European Parliament, Mr Prodi. At the moment, good governance appears in the Commission's book to mean, first and foremost, governance on its own or governance alone and I urgently advise you not to pursue that course and call on you to confirm that it is the European Parliament which takes the decisions and also controls you. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, it all sounds very hunky-dory, but a lot of it is cosmetic. Why not go in for a proper reform and do away with endless quota regulations, ceilings, minimum and maximum livestock densities, slaughter premiums and fattening bonuses? Why not just pay the farmers and say: you decide, do you want to slaughter the calves now, irrespective of how fat or thin they are, or do you want to get out of production completely? Would that not be a more reasonable course of action? And then I ask you: are you going to operate the guillotine – will you make it a rule that holdings with more than 90 animals will not get any subsidies?
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Mr President, we are in exactly the same situation as we were six years ago. I believe that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is due to speak after me; that means that all of us who have basically concentrated on little else in our work over the last six years except BSE are back again. The European Parliament has been calling for much of what the agricultural ministers have now decided – half willingly, half unwillingly – for over six years now. Mr Byrne intimated as much. What was done then about removing risk material? All the Member States tried to obstruct and block for as long as possible. If, Mr Byrne, as you now say, the question of removing the vertebral column is a problem, then they are again dragging their feet. What is the matter with them? For the moment we must consider the vertebral column to be risk material, in all Member States. It must be removed, it must be removed in the abattoir and it must be treated as risk material. And there is an end to it. Not here a little loophole, there a little loophole! I have learned in my eleven years in the European Parliament that progress here moves at a snail's pace. It is a fact of life. We have moved forward at a snail's pace. That is fine as long as we move forward. I have nothing against that, but I would like to move a wee bit faster here, because now is our chance: we are surrounded in the Member States by jittery meat markets and, as a result, we have got jittery agricultural ministers, jittery finance ministers – everyone has got the jitters. Unfortunately, it is also affecting farmers and the meat processing industry and the feedingstuffs industry, which I always mention in the same breath as everyone who did not exactly go out of their way to do anything about improving quality in the past. So if we look at these compliant meat markets and see that here is our chance, the chance to push measures forward, then we must decide exactly what sort of measures we need. They obviously include, as you have just said Mr Byrne, extending the definition of risk material, so that we can, at long last, ban all mechanically recovered meat. Of course, we could have done this years ago, but it must all be banned, not just a bit from the skull and a bit from the vertebral column like last time. We must get rid of it all; we no longer need it in an affluent society like ours, that is obvious. What else do we need to do? We need to do the same with animal fats. We cannot differentiate between animal fats or gelatine on the basis, for example, of whether or not they reach the human food chain or whether or not they are used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. That is out of the question. Fats must be sterilised by pressure cooking. End of story! No other method should be allowed now. We must minimise the risks, that is obvious. You said something quite wonderful, Mr Byrne and I should like to pick up on it. How do we handle derogations in the Member States for the vertebral column, fats and so on? What do we do about the Member States which are BSE-free? That is when I lean back in my chair and think to myself: here we go again. I have heard it all before in recent years. Exactly which Member State is BSE-free? And may I ask: how do they know? Do they look inside the animals' head? And if they can do that, perhaps they can tell us exactly what is going on. We too want to do likewise. Until such time as the Member States introduce comprehensive testing, and we know how slipshod testing can be, until such time as everything is tested comprehensively, including – and I agree with Mr Böge here – the animals taken from the market, then we shall never have a complete picture; until such time as there is comprehensive testing, we shall not know if Finland, Germany, Austria or Italy are BSE-free. And until we have that information, we shall treat all Member States the same, end of story. Then we shall see which Member States block everything again and we shall publicise the fact. I wonder just which Member States think they can hold out now. There is no time left to address all the points, but I must, nonetheless, touch on what has been my favourite subject for a long time: we can pass the best legislation here in the European Union, but what use is it if it is not controlled in the Member States? I believe that there are too few veterinarians in all the Member States, too few food inspectors, too few on-site inspections. Which is why I call on you, Mr Byrne, to force the Member States to report to you on how many veterinarians they have, how many food inspectors they have, when and what they control and what they have done in the past. I welcome and thank you for your monthly reports! (Applause)
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a quite remarkable as well as a cynical debate that we are holding here. I am almost inclined to resist any involvement in a discussion about which type of lethal ammunition is the better. And yet that is what we are doing today. I have never taken any part in debates about which wars are expedient and which are unavoidable either. That is not our subject today. We have a different subject to discuss. In the past, we have repeatedly said that, if it is necessary to use armed force – and we have always agreed on this – we must ensure that our intervention has no more impact than is absolutely essential and that it does the least possible damage to the environment and to the health of those who survive it. This, of course, is why we have constantly condemned and denounced chemical weapons, for example, and have always agreed that these weapons must never be used, because the havoc they wreak on the environment and on human health is out of all proportion to their military effectiveness. If we are discussing today whether munitions containing uranium do or do not cause leukaemia, then I have no desire to hear anyone tell us, not even Dr Solana, whom I greatly respect, whether or not there is definitive proof. We are not talking about definitive proof, and when we spoke in this House about our own health and about BSE, we certainly all agreed that the precautionary principle had to be applied, even though we were never able to prove that infected substances are the cause of new-variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. (Applause)
 We recently discussed the precautionary principle and put it to the vote, and we said that we must ban particular substances or procedures if there are justifiable concerns about them, even if there is no definitive proof. We know today that there are numerous cases of leukaemia. And as long as the scientists are still arguing, as long as all of us do not know which of the scientists is correct, we must agree that this ammunition cannot be used until every last aspect of the issue has been resolved. Surely nothing less than a moratorium on this ammunition would be an acceptable decision for us to take today. But in addition to this we must also care for the people who live in the regions, for their health and the health of their children. (Applause)

 Madam President, I have lost count of how many times we have discussed this over the last four years and of how often I have spoken on this subject. I particularly admire your courage, Mr President-in-Office, in coming here today, because I am sure that apart from the rhetorical boxing round the ears you have received from Mr Böge, you will also be on the receiving end of some other harsh words as a stand-in – and I wish to make that point clear – for your fellow Members of the Council of Ministers. We have brought in legislation, starting with our exposure of the BSE scandal, which, for years, the Council wanted to sweep under the carpet. We have produced excellent legislation. Let me mention some examples for you: the ban on feeding animal meal to ruminants, animal meal production methods and the removal of risk materials. Where was the Council when this legislation had to be implemented? How long did the Commission have to put up with getting a bloody nose in the Council of Ministers before the removal of risk materials was legislated on? Why did this Council, which attaches so much importance to consumer protection and which now acts as if public health were its top priority, not act earlier and say that this could also be achieved without legislation? You, Mr President-in-Office, and all your colleagues would have been in a position to take appropriate measures in the Member States long before the Commission, unfortunately somewhat belatedly, brought forward its proposal to process only those animal parts suitable for human consumption into animal meal. This could have been a Council initiative. I really wonder why we had to do battle with the Council about beef labelling in the European Court of Justice. Was that necessary? I also wish to ask you, Mr President-in-Office, in relation to your reference to France's policy, why it has taken France so long to transpose the legislation on animal meal manufacturing methods? I fail to understand that. Nor can I understand why France could not transpose the provisions on the pressure, temperature and heating time for the production of animal meal more quickly. As Mr Böge has already said – he and I were rapporteurs for the TSE regulation – we had our first reading on 17 May. Where is the Council common position, if this is so important? Excuse me, Mr President-in-Office, if I make a rather heretical assumption, namely that you personally are certainly very interested in public health and in consumer health, but time and again I cannot help feeling that the Council considers market organisation and economic aspects to be much more compelling. And the moment, as you would put it, public hysteria breaks out, there is immediate concern about beef markets collapsing. Then you react. I would say to you with one small reservation, Mr President-in-Office, that I am very interested to know when those countries which have today agreed a universal ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs will open the door again by saying that animal meal is now being produced safely and we can feed it to animals once more. But I shall be very calm and wait for you to tell me something new here. I will tell you exactly what we need, ladies and gentlemen – we need two things. The first is good legislation. We have already put large parts of this in place, and we are trying to take this further, and we need to act quickly. It is up to you to deliver this legislation quickly. Up to now the Council has acted as a very major brake on this. All 15 Members of the Council have dragged their feet. And I can tell you that worked very well, it was very effective. Once we have good legislation we need controls. That is why I am very grateful that our joint motion for a resolution, which I hope will be adopted almost unanimously tomorrow, contains a requirement for the Member States to report on their controls. I would like to know when Germany, France, Sweden, Austria and all the other countries have carried out health checks on the production of animal feed, and when veterinary checks have been carried out, and how many poor overworked veterinary officers there are, and whether you are recruiting any new ones at all. If you are serious about all this, then you do not need a token Food Authority, which might prepare legislation on food safety, but which is not in a position to deliver what we can: good legislation and controls. That is your job, Mr President-in-Office. Madam President, I would be delighted if this were to be my last speech on this subject in this House, because we really must get this sorted out sooner or later! (Applause)

 Mr President, the fact that only 19 amendments have been tabled in this Chamber on a subject as complex as this one, which very quickly stirs up feelings and leads to heated emotions, is a sign that excellent preparatory work has been done with the rapporteur on a basis of trust, and also involving all the other groups in the committee. I wish to thank the rapporteur for that. The White Paper is by no means an answer to any of the crises. It was high time that the Commission produced the White Paper to follow the Green Paper published many years ago now. It should also be said, as some of the previous speakers have done, and in particular Mr Whitehead and Mrs Gebhardt, that the White Paper is more than just another set of EU rules and regulations. For example, the White Paper must ensure that conditions are created in which safe food is possible at all. If we do not manage to modernise the early warning system and make it work, then there is little point in worrying about much else. If we cannot manage to get the early warning system to emphasise the Member States' responsibility, then we will have a problem. We need to apply stricter legislation, stricter guidelines and stricter criteria to animal feed. Hygiene regulations governing animal feed production, and also regarding checks, need to be much tougher. Without a new framework directive we will be helpless in many areas of food safety. With this in mind, the Commission has presented some 80 proposals – either totally new or proposals for amendments – a very ambitious programme indeed. I can see that in some areas the Commission is already active. I believe that this programme is a step in the right direction. Of course we are all talking mainly about this new Food Safety Agency. We agreed in committee what this new authority can and cannot do, but I would also like to remind you that food safety is important. We already have scientific bodies in the EU which look after this. However, if we cannot succeed in getting the Member States to actually carry out checks on the spot on the basis of the legislation, if we cannot manage to oblige them to provide information on who checks what, when and how often, then even if we created 20 new authorities in the European Union, not a jot would change as regards food safety. We should not lose sight of that, because in that case, a new authority, whatever it was called, would just be a smokescreen and a token gesture. Some country somewhere would then be happy to provide a home for this new authority, but otherwise nothing would happen. The expressions that then come to mind are "everyone turns a blind eye" or "the dog barks, but the caravan moves on". Hygiene regulations and on-the-spot checks should be the slogan of the hour. And the ones who need to do something about this are not so much the Commission and ourselves, but rather the Member States, who so far have not done their homework. (Applause)

 Madam President, as we have already told the rapporteur and the House repeatedly, there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro-organisms, namely the report by David Bowe, which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure. This is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants. It is therefore only sensible, and indeed, right and proper, to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure, which will not be for another six weeks or so, and then take decisions on all the other pieces of legislation. I therefore support Mr Lannoye’s amendment.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Mr President, may I thank my colleagues who have already spoken. Now that I have heard Mrs Klass, I am now in a somewhat calmer frame of mind. Looking over towards Mr Böge, with whom I cooperated very closely, and towards the coordinator, Mr Goepel, I wish to express my thanks to them too for the withdrawal of Amendments Nos 41 to 44, which would have permitted the various blending options. I also say that very clearly in the context of the two reports we are dealing with here today. We want food safety, which means safe production from beginning to end of the food chain. That is something which this House has always unanimously advocated. During one of the greatest of all food crises, namely the BSE crisis, the House managed to cooperate in a spirit of mutual confidence, irrespective of party affiliations, and I should have found it very regrettable if, at such a juncture as this, a pseudo-interest group – for it would not have been a genuine interest group – had carried the day. During the BSE crisis, we always said – and Mr Böge was the foremost proponent of this view – that dioxin-contaminated milk must never be mixed with non-contaminated milk as a means of reducing the level of the undesirable substance below the maximum permitted value. We dealt in exactly the same way with all other matters relating to the blending ban. That is why I am grateful to the Commission for introducing this new element to its legislative proposal and to the rapporteur for her master strokes which have introduced slight additions and improvements to the proposal at several points. So what do we actually want? Of course we do not wish to treat the manufacturers of compound feed and other animal feed in any way unfairly, nor do we wish to be unfair towards the poor farmers. But it is not the answer simply to permit blending. Perhaps a register showing contaminated areas would actually be a solution. But I will not accept waste incinerators! Waste incinerators are no longer permitted to emit dioxins. If they still break the rules, it is not only to the detriment of farmers but to the population as a whole. Mrs Klass, would you be so kind as to listen to me? I listened very patiently to you, although I sometimes find that difficult! We must establish a register. We have long been demanding a dioxin register in the European Union which would show where contamination is occurring. And of course, where fields are close to motorways, we must look and see where heavy-metal contamination is occurring. In such circumstances I can certainly accept that farmers in those areas will go to their regional authorities and will tell the Commission too that regional planning, transport, road traffic and other factors are affecting the fields they have inherited from their fathers and that damage is occurring through no fault of their own. How shall we compensate them for this?. Mr Goepel here is making a gesture to indicate money. No question about that. Nor do I have any problem with allowing dilution or blending in the case of certain products, provided it is always carried out under the control of the Member State and of the Commission. That is something to be examined in due course. Let me say again that we shall be doing nobody any favours, nobody in this entire world – neither manufacturers nor farmers nor consumers – if we act here as if this were a conflict between farmers and manufacturers of food products or consumers. We all want the same thing and we have to say this very clearly here in Parliament. One more word on inspections. Yes, the Commission must be able to take protective measures. It can do that in the domain of foodstuffs, and it must also be able to do it in the domain of animal feed. If all of us were served animal feed in the canteen downstairs for a period of time, if we were able to see on our own plates exactly what animal feed is, we should perhaps deal with the issue rather differently and be just as hard and as stringent as we are on the safety of food for human consumption.

Mr President, what I enjoy most about this House is that I am always learning new things. Today, for instance, I learned that, at the time when my esteemed colleagues Graefe zu Baringdorf and Böge were in the Landjugend
 – in other words until very recently, in a manner of speaking – there were open declarations. So that in itself has already made my morning. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur from the committee which was ultimately entrusted with responsibility for this report, said that we have long been pressing for this open declaration and that we have redoubled our exhortations to the Commission on the marketing of compound feed since the BSE episode. He rightly praised the Commission for its more or less prompt fulfilment of its mandates. The Commission's proposal is sound, and I am convinced that we shall muster enough agreement within the House on the few amendments to be able to stand up to the Council on this issue. I entirely fail to comprehend why the manufacturers of compound feed – who have spoken to many of us, as you know – believe that resistance against open declarations will achieve anything. It will get them nowhere. As we have all been saying in our speeches, whether here in the House or in our home constituencies, we must begin to win back the public trust that we have lost, and we must be unstinting in our efforts to do so. That entails a host of measures. One such measure is the introduction of open declarations, and an open declaration is not merely an indication of the percentage of various content categories or generic classifications but clear and precise details of the ingredients contained in the feed mix. It is unacceptable to have ‘starch’, ‘fats’ or ‘protein’ on the packaging; the manufacturer must state which
 protein and which 
fats are in the mix. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf made that quite clear. But we need more than that, which is why both the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee have stated once again, rather in the fashion of a Tibetan prayer wheel, that we need a white list. We need a white list of the additives and ingredients that are authorised for use in feed mixes. The Commission has pledged itself to work on this list and has also said it is not something that can be done in a couple of days. We do not expect that either. What we do expect, however, is that the Commission will give us regular updates and that it has an approximate timetable for the accomplishment of this task. After all, it would be unacceptable if, in the meantime, we were plunged back into a situation in which the Commission had to write to the Member States to find out how the Directive on sewage sludge was being interpreted. We will have none of that! We must have a clear and unequivocal white list, and both committees – the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee – have reiterated that point. It naturally means a large investment of time and money in monitoring, which is why both committees have stated that manufacturers also have an obligation to provide evidence. This obligation involves furnishing precise details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs on request, and is designed to shift some of the burden of proof as well as to minimise the cost of monitoring in the Member States. We naturally have no wish to spend vast amounts of time and money on monitoring and to be constantly setting off to conduct inspections all over the place. So if we were to do what we intend, if we were to implement it quickly and then pass quickly through the codecision procedure too, that would certainly be a huge step forward, and I feel sure that we shall be very strong and united in our dealings with the Council.

Mr President, yes, Mrs Palacio, you are absolutely right – what we need is dialogue. Yes, we must increase the financial support, and yes, we oppose cartels and monopolies. That is all quite true. But reducing taxation and other things – which, funnily enough, is what certain Members to my left have suggested – is no way to solve the problem. That would lead nowhere. OPEC and the oil producing countries will immediately move in to close this gap. They have a political and economic hold over us. What chance do we stand against this? (Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)
 Have we reduced our consumption? No. Mr Jarzembowski, who has just spoken – he can shout loudly, and so can I as it happens – says that there must be a paradigm shift where traffic is concerned. There is more road transport than there was ten years ago. It is high time this was changed. We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned. There needs to be more transport via rail and water – let us make it happen. We need to be less dependent. Let us pursue a common energy policy, for example. You, Mrs Palacio, and we MEPs, should call for a common energy policy to be incorporated into the Treaty. We are still lacking such a policy. So who is guilty of blocking it to date? For example, what we need to do, Mrs Palacio, is to get rid of the link between gas and oil prices. You could do that in tandem with the Commission. Why are gas prices linked to oil prices? There is no reason why they should be. You are the obvious person to bring this about. We can do all of these things. There are many things we can do, which the Member States have failed to do so far. We can use these opportunities. Unfortunately, I am speaking too fast for the interpreter, and I apologise for this. Right now, there must be no falling out between groups on the right, and those on the left or in the centre, above or below. The OPEC States will watch from the sidelines, smile indulgently, and put the prices up. (Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)
 We must show a united front, and the same goes for the Ministers meeting in the Transport Council – and you, Mr Jarzembowski, would do well to shout less loudly and at last get round to doing something in your transport committee.

 Mr President, I respect your decision. But may I point out that it is extremely thoughtless to vote on legislation – and the next report is a legislative report – on a Thursday afternoon in July! (Applause)
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – (DE)
 I am sorry, Mr President, to continue from where I left off a moment ago and come back to what Mr Swoboda just said. Mr President, I understand everything you have said. But this week for the first time we did not have a vote at noon on Tuesday. That is a decision that was taken. We were against; the majority of the House – had they known of it – the rapporteurs – Mrs Redondo Jiménez and Mr Arvidsson and others – would no doubt also have been against it. But if we do this, then we must also show some degree of flexibility. Among this rather smaller body of people I dare to say this; most of us are experienced parliamentarians and we know that there are different kinds of sittings. The Thursday sitting in July is a particularly sensitive one. We know that, we may not be happy about it, but that is how it is. So I would ask you to check whether the four legislative reports that are still on the agenda, and that do not need long votes, can be carried over to the next part-session. Mrs Redondo Jiménez herself asked the same, in the case of her report, and she has my support. Mr Arvidsson – all this relates to what I know about – will, I hope, also agree. So I would ask you to contact the rapporteurs and the groups. Mr Swoboda has already said it, and I can repeat it for my own group: we will agree to these four legislative reports being carried over to the September part-session or to a part-session in Brussels.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, you are absolutely right, that is the correct procedure. But if we plan to do that and if it is certain that, let us say, Mr Swoboda or I or others move this proposal, it would be only fair to inform the rapporteurs of this possibility.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I remind you that we have been talking about beef labelling since 1997. At that time, we fought manfully – and womanfully! – against the Council, shoulder to shoulder with the Commission. It could be exactly the same again today. I remember it well – things were just as heated as in the BSE days. But we tried this here in Parliament ten years ago, and that is why I want to clearly remind some of you again that labelling has nothing to do with the safety of a product.  There are two very different issues here. One is the safety of a product, and the only products we should allow on the European market are safe products and those that involve no risk for consumers. The other issue is consumer information and the consumer’s right to choose. You can only exercise your freedom of choice if you are well informed. This applies to the origin of tomatoes just as much as it does to preservatives or colouring agents in food, and it also applies to which beef or meat products in general I would like to buy, because I am sure you will not be surprised to hear that I would of course like to go further. I would like to see labelling of all meat products and not just beef products. I am sure that Mr Fischler will agree with me on this. I can understand Mr Papayannakis, our rapporteur, when he says that this House has pressed for this legislation to come into force. And when he says that we in this House have brought forward the date it is to come into force. And that now, if we are to maintain our credibility, we must strive to enforce this legislation as quickly as possible. He is quite right! I understand that, but I nevertheless voted for the amendments in committee and will do the same again in this Chamber tomorrow. One thing is certain: I do not intend to be held hostage by the Council. If the Council, in its infinite wisdom, which is often a mystery to me, believes that it has to amend the common position so that it is not the same as the text debated at first reading and the text Parliament approved with the Commission’s agreement, and if the Council therefore makes a decision at the initiative of one Member State and with the somewhat reluctant agreement of other Member States, than that really is something new for us! The categories of animal added are also something new for us. I might even have been prepared to say, fine, so be it. But I would like to know just what these categories are. So my attitude towards the Commission, which has otherwise become positively affectionate in recent years, is rather more critical in this respect. I would have liked to know what categories you have in mind, and I might then still have been willing to say ‘OK’. But I am not going to play the dangerous game of saying that I agree to the categories and then find out in about six months’ time that categories have been adopted under the committee procedure that make me shake my head in disbelief. That is why tomorrow, in common I hope with the majority of this House, I will be voting – as I did in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection – to delete these categories. As Mr Whitehead said, it need not take long. We do not need a Conciliation Committee – the Council and the Commission can simply accept Parliament’s amendments, and then the job is done.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, it is very difficult to find new things to say at the end of this kind of debate. Allow me therefore to say something slightly provocative, which I relish doing: when I listen attentively and hear confirmed what I have known to be the case for thirty years, i.e. that smoking is dangerous – we all know that is the case and have done for thirty years – then I ask myself why we do not actually ban the production of cigarettes. It would be very much the logical thing to do and perhaps the Commission could give some thought to the matter. But I would not wish to overdo being provocative and will become a little more serious. I have this to say to the Commission: if we are serious, not just about creating transparency and informing people, but above all, about trying to make a harmful product as tolerable as possible – assuming we can – then surely one of the first things we need to do is to clarify the issue of additives.   I ask myself, and would like to know from the Commission, why there is still no harmonisation, no approximation of permitted additives? Why does the European Union not have a list of permitted additives, or a regulation specifying permitted amounts? What is stopping us from drawing up a positive list and labelling accordingly? We should put our money where our mouth is. That is not what is happening here. There is another point I would like to add: why are we not being consistent in our approach and harmonising taxation, if we are convinced that cigarettes are harmful? Why are you doing nothing in this respect? I, for one, would support you if you did. Why are we not going to harmonise taxation, preferably at a high level? I urge all the honourable members who have spoken today to support this. Harmonisation of taxation at a high level within the European Union. If we know that smoking is dangerous then we cannot have a situation where tobacco is being used and consumed in one Member State at a high rate of taxation, and at a very low rate in another Member State. Do something about this please, Mr Byrne, and put your money where your mouth is in this respect as well.   In my next point I would like to raise the issue of subsidies. Even if this point does not belong here, I know that we must raise it nonetheless, Mr Byrne. If you are serious about protecting people’s health, then when it comes to the budget, I would like to see you fight to have subsidies spent on something other than tobacco cultivation!
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, our discussion today on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, transmissible diseases which include BSE or scrapie, is one of the many follow-up reports or one of the follow-up discussions to the final BSE report and I think that it is also of great interest to the visitors in the gallery. We have a report here before us which the Commission promised together with its final report on the 1997 BSE report at Parliament’s request. It has now presented it. We have drafted a report on it, although not as quickly as we would otherwise have done, due to the break last year. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Böge have drafted opinions on it. In other words, we have been able to keep the BSE team going well. I should like to tell you briefly how I, as rapporteur for the committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, assess the proposal. The Commission’s proposal is a good one; like so much of what the Commission has presented on BSE and follow-up problems and has satisfied us in previous years, we are also satisfied with this proposal but, like most things, it still has room for improvement, Mr Byrne. I said that your proposal on BSE testing had room for improvement and I say so again here today. The involvement of the European Parliament certainly needs to be improved. We must ensure that the European Parliament can act in the codecision procedure as the real guarantor of consumer and health protection in the European Union. Only then will we have a high standard and only then will you be able to work in proper collaboration with us, because the Council of Ministers, the individual Agricultural Ministers have not exactly been at the vanguard of the movement over recent years, as we here in the House are only too aware. It is also important, and here too another proposal needs improvement, for us to hold further discussions on the rapid BSE tests. You tabled a proposal after this TSE proposal which you then needed to adjust, but the proposal is still inadequate. If we are to be able to make a real appraisal of the BSE situation in the Member States, we must make it clear that fallen stock are also to be tested for human health safety in a screening process. So far you have presented no proposal on this. What we also need, and we have tried to achieve this in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is to strengthen the Member States’ obligation to inform the Commission and to give the Commission information and data on incidents in their countries, on BSE problems or on suspicious circumstances. Here too we need to take the Member States to task more. Here, too, I repeat: mistrust is always shown of the Member States, including my own, and rightly so. Mr Böge rightly pointed out – as I am sure he will again in his presentation – that we need a Community definition of geographical areas. The definition here is clearly inadequate and the Commission must explain – and I call on you to do so Mr Byrne – how it intends to deal with derogations for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other medicinal products. I am convinced of the need for the Commission to make proposals in order to close any loopholes in current legislation. Allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then, thanks to the speaking time for my group, I shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate. I agree with nearly all the proposed amendments, but there are some and here I would ask how you evaluate them, Mr Byrne. This applies in particular to proposed Amendment No 50, which includes cat food in the proposal tabled by Mr Böge, who I know takes a very careful approach to everything. But you have said that you have a problem with cat food. Please say something about the risk of infection from cats. Mrs Attwooll and others have proposed a number of amendments, specifically Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55. These proposed amendments limit the present proposal and do not represent any improvement, not even for the situation in the United Kingdom, which I would have understood. For example, no distinction is made between breeding and fattening; that is a completely inadequate proposal. I sympathise with the suggestion in the second part of proposed Amendment No 56 that certain materials should be removed if a Member State has a specific and efficient system, but I must also say unequivocally that, at the present stage of the discussion on special risk materials, it is a dangerous signal to Member States such as my own, which are very reticent. Allow me to repeat quite clearly: the repercussions on the Member States have obviously been overestimated by some members in the House. In countries which have a good, operational system and a high level of protection, this regulation will not cause any deterioration. But in countries which do not, it would at long last force them to buckle down and give priority to safety and health protection. That is why I fail to understand much of the mistrust of many members, but perhaps we can clear that up in the debate. Mr President, I shall have another three minutes at the end of the debate, which I shall use to comment on some of the interventions by the honourable Members.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE
),  
rapporteur. – (DE) 
Mr President, I asked to be allowed to speak again at the end of the debate – we are not quite at the end. Allow me to say a few words on the debate. I would like to thank the honourable Members who have spoken so far, and Mrs Doyle, Mr Goodwill and Mr Nicholson, who have yet to speak, for what they have to say and for the fair treatment we are giving each other. Those who sat in Parliament during the last parliamentary term know that it is Parliament which has cause to be proud of having got a grip on the BSE disaster in the individual committees and in the House as a whole, in a way which cut across the political divide. I tried at all times, as chair of the committee, to be fair to all the Member States, strict but fair, as my teachers always used to say to me, and I am trying to do the same now. Allow me therefore to say a few words on some of the points raised. Yes, Mr Trakatellis and others are right, Mr Staes. We still have no tests for live animals. We still have no tests for very early infection, which is why the Commission is being called upon to keep on working on this, and I know that it is doing so. Of course we need that. Mr Whitehead said quite clearly that safety must be a priority, but he would, of course, like the precautionary principle to be applied in equal measure in other Member States and that is the main point here. To some members who have spoken or who have perhaps yet to speak I should like to state one thing quite clearly: we are legislating here for the whole of the European Union, for the 15 Member States with widely varying safety levels. We are not legislating just for Great Britain. We know that the data-based export scheme, that the OTS over-30-month scheme, that all these things are important and are working. I am the first to recognise what Great Britain has achieved and at what price to farmers. I have spoken to countless officials and farmers’ representatives in Great Britain over recent years and I know that. Nonetheless, I must ensure that this level of safety also applies to Italy, Germany and all the other countries in the European Union. Which is why I believe that this regulation is a good regulation. When Mrs Attwooll and others ask if we can have derogations for countries which are already that good and if they must still remove the spinal column, then I call on you, Mr Byrne, to table a proper list of derogations to the Council saying countries A, B, C and D comply and are exempt from certain measures. I will be the first to support it. But I do not want this to be rushed, as is the case with certain proposed amendments. This is why I stand by the position which I described earlier. I think that we really should stick with what we discussed in committee and with what Mrs Doyle and I have re-tabled. This particularly applies to proposed Amendment No 56, to which Mrs Attwooll referred. I will be the first to support this at second reading, if the Council makes the proposal, but we need to list clearly and to substantiate clearly where derogations are possible and under what conditions and for which Member State. What must the Member State do to qualify? And of course I support Mrs Grossetête: naturally, tests must be carried out on animals which have died from unknown causes but that is already included in the Commission’s proposal on the tests. (Applause)

 – (DE) 
Mr President, I understand perfectly that it is an honour for us to receive a distinguished guest of state. However, I would ask you, when the Bureau next meets, to address the question as to whether it is a constructive use of time to interrupt a vote that we need a qualified majority for and for which there are only seven or eight proposed amendments. I would urge you to address this matter in the Bureau.  (Applause)

 Mr President, the rapporteur said in his introduction that crises have a cleansing effect. I listened to him and hope that what he said is right. He is evidently more optimistic than I am. I do not really think that crises have a purifying effect. If crises were to have a purifying effect, then Agriculture Ministers would have rather more understanding than they evidently do. Once again we are sitting and standing in this Parliament at a time when we are, for the most part, agreed among ourselves and with the Commission, whilst the person with whom we do not agree, namely the Council representative, is absent. Such is life! It would be nice if he could be made aware of this, but that is probably unlikely. The rapporteur, and also Mrs Klaß, who has just spoken, have pointed out that Parliament allowed the Commission proposal to pass through first reading unamended. This means that the institutions who are not always in agreement were, on this occasion, agreed. And what has the Council learnt from this? It was the Council (and I say this again in all clarity, drawing in part on my own experiences of recent years) which basically got us into the BSE scandal. It was not this Parliament, and only to a very minor extent the Commission. It was the Council of Ministers who tried repeatedly to keep things under wraps. So what has it learnt from the BSE crisis? Has it learnt that it is better to be transparent? Has it learnt that it is better to permit safeguard options and safeguard clauses? Has it learnt that rapid action is needed? It has learnt none of these things! It has submitted to us a common position in which the option to have a safeguard clause will actually be taken away from the Commission. It will not have the option to get involved quickly and unbureaucratically on the basis of safeguard clauses. It will also not have the option to make unannounced on-the-spot inspections. It will not be in a position to act quickly. And it will also not need to inform the European Parliament, nor will it need to publish any inspection reports lest, heaven forbid, the public finds out something which worries it. It is better to leave things in the hands of the Agriculture Ministers. I can see the Council representative writing busily and I hope that this will also be passed on to the Presidency and the other members of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I am sorry if I am not being very amiable at the moment, and particularly with my cold I would much rather be mellow, but the fact is I am not. I consider this common position to be scandalous! It is we who have worked for untainted animal feedingstuffs in recent years, we who established that we got BSE because animal feedingstuffs were mixed in a way in which they should never have been mixed, we who established that there just happens to be dioxin in the peel of oranges and other fruits and that we have it in our animal feed, we who established that sewage sludge has no place in animal feedingstuffs, we who established that hormones should not accelerate growth and do not belong in animal feedingstuffs, we who established that there is no place for antibiotics, nor cough medicines for calves – we have established all these things; my goodness, I am making more agricultural policy, and I come from the constituency of Berlin, which is a purely urban constituency, than my voters can imagine, because it is consumer protection policy – and if we know all of this, then what is the Council learning from it? Yet again we are providing an example here right across all the groups, the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, who has just spoken for her group, and me for my group, of how the institutions work closely together. We support, Mr Byrne, the fact that you will have the opportunities which you need in the Commission in Brussels, for example via the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin, that will enable you to carry out rapid inspections and take safeguard measures, so that we are actually able to say to consumers that we genuinely care about safe food, and safe feedingstuffs and animal nutrition inspections are the first step in all this. I thank you for the fact that you will obviously now be able to table a motion for the primary inspection of European Union products, not just, as in this instance, products from third countries. It only makes sense if we prevent this in unison and only then, Commissioner, does the White Paper on food safety, which you have presented, also make sense. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, we will actually slap the Council of Ministers in the face by unanimously affirming the rapporteur’s four amendments.

Madam President, Commissioner, it will come as no surprise to you that I am not satisfied. I have quite a few questions. Parliament has been calling for the BSE test to be made compulsory since the BSE control committee. I have asked you time and again for quite some time now: do you not consider that making the test compulsory as late as January 2001 is too little by a long chalk and much too late, given that the BSE tests were assessed a year ago? Do you also not consider, Mr Byrne, that taking dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview, i.e. carry out proper screening, by testing one animal in every five, six or ten thousand to be slaughtered, depending on the BSE status of the Member State? Mr Byrne, if the only reason for this weak Commission proposal is the Member States’ unwillingness to agree, are you prepared to tell the House which Member States refused to agree to a more ambitious proposal?
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, I should like to have begun my intervention with the title of a play by Shakespeare: ‘Much ado about nothing’, but unfortunately it would be totally unsuitable. There is much ado about a great deal. However loath I am to put things a little more into the right context, thereby perhaps disassociating myself somewhat from the President-in-Office of the Council, the point is: we are not talking about the environment here, which I am otherwise quite happy to discuss, as you well know, we are talking about health. What we are discussing today has very little to do with legislation on transport or the environment; on the contrary, we are legislating to protect people. Every scientist in the world, including the USA, has established over recent years that noise makes people ill. Noise makes people ill and therefore not only injures and stresses people themselves, it also damages the community as a whole, i.e. the national economy. That is something which many of us here wish to bear in mind, which is why we tabled this legislation. That is the only reason. That is what we wish to bear in mind, irrespective of the fact that, otherwise, we are, of course, always happy to integrate transport policy into other policy areas and environmental policy into transport. The legislation is in force, as everyone has said here today and, commendably, the Commissioner too has again made that quite clear. The last few times I have listened to you, Mrs de Palacio, I was most impressed by the very clear, very logical and very decisive manner in which you conveyed that. I welcome that and I congratulate you. The legislation is in force and I therefore wonder what the Council of transport ministers discussed yesterday. Basically, it has nothing to discuss, unless it wants to submit new legislation to us, which is obviously not the case. Mrs de Palacio said earlier that she will need Parliament’s support at some point for the second part of the regulation, the part relating to third countries, including the United States, South America and the countries of eastern Europe, i.e. all countries outside the European Union. That is the part which is due to enter into force in April 2002. But if you approach us, Mrs de Palacio, and want us to defer this part, then I think you will need to offer us more than you have at the moment, as you well know. If you go back and negotiate, then one thing must be made clear and I hope and believe that the House is relatively united on this question: it must be clear that we need a declaration of unequivocal standards. We must be clear and united on where we want to go and what the ultimate goal is. I am not haggling over six months, but I do want clear objectives and we must have a clear timetable. If – and I say this now completely off the record, insofar as I can in a minuted debate – if, rather than April 2002, it were September 2002 or even January 2003, I would be the last to make a song and a dance about it, but I do want a clear, binding timetable to be adhered to by everyone concerned, including the USA. Once we have all this, then I should like to see it go through the general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Authority, the ICAO, in September. If it goes through in September of next year, then we still have enough time to suspend the regulation. I am not prepared to consider a suspension without the conditions which I have just formulated. If that is, nonetheless, what you come to us with, then it will be possible, but it will have to go through the normal legislative procedure and then you will need Parliament’s support – even the United States of America must understand that – and then perhaps we can finish at the end of the day with another play which Shakespeare might have called “No ado about anything”!

Mr President, Mr Prodi, we have already had this discussion, several weeks ago in fact. You also made the point then, that you intend to gauge the success of your work from the level of turnout at the European elections in 2004. As I said at the time, for a body that is not directly elected by the people, that is a truly presumptuous statement. However, that is your plan and I intend to go into it in further detail.   The European Parliament, along with myself and all my fellow MEPs – who every day are to be found canvassing in the most direct manner for support for these EU policies, down on the streets and squares of Europe, and who do not just sit in ivory towers – to put it without fear or favour – are reliant on its being able to function. Therefore, I infer from what you have said that the European Commission will work in even closer cooperation with the European Parliament, in a spirit of openness, transparency and partnership. We have yet to see whether any of the developments of the last few weeks give us cause to hope that such openness and transparency will actually gain ground, and I intend to judge you on this.   You have said a great deal today, Mr Prodi, on the areas that I have responsibility for on behalf of my group. The areas in question are environmental policy, consumer protection and health policy. I would expressly like to commend you for the fact that, for the first time in my experience, you have diverged from your usual practice of delivering a lecture on economics with only a smattering of comments on matters such as food authorities, doping, or flight delays. I seldom commend you, and so I am keen to take the opportunity to say this. Unlike speeches you have made in the past, this one was far more down-to-earth and what is more, I could understand it.   Of course, I am less impressed when it comes to the detail. This will surprise neither you nor any of my fellow MEPs. Where is your coherence, Mr Prodi? I have read your programme, which you represent on behalf of your Commission as a whole. You say, for example, that you wish to take account of environmental policy in all the other policy areas. The only area where that has happened is Mrs Palacio’s area, i.e. transport. In what way exactly has environmental policy been taken account of in the other sectors, for example enlargement – a huge problem – food safety and consumer protection? Where does it feature in the text? Take trade policy, for example, nothing, not a single word, Mr Prodi. Take competition or economic policy: not a single word. It is nowhere to be found. Another case of paying lip service. Statements are always being made to the effect that environmental policy must be taken account of, and there is no way round this, but you do not actually put this into practice. That is something else I will need to judge you on. Nowhere have you made clear reference to the links between or the possible interdependence of the various policy areas. You must not neglect to mention this in your other papers. You must be critical of this fact, and you must not publish them in this form either. Your proposals were far too specific, which is all very nice and is something I welcome, but it is not enough. We will gauge how successful you have been, Mr Prodi, on a weekly, monthly and annual basis. We will assess what is happening in the Commission, and in what form, on a weekly basis. We will see how matters stand in the committees and in plenary sittings, on a monthly basis. How does the Commission perform in the committees and in the plenary sittings? For example, how do you deal with the European Parliament’s proposed amendments? If you want to work with us, and if we both – you, Mr Prodi, on behalf of the Commission, and we, the European Parliament – say that we will all gauge our success according to the elections in 2004 and the election turn-out, then I would like to hear you say that all the proposed amendments that this Parliament has a majority vote on will be adopted by the Commission. And we will assess your own performance on an annual basis, when we take the programme from the previous year and look at what you have achieved and managed to deliver, and to what standard you have done so. You see, Mr Prodi, it is a lot more simple than you might fear. You will not have to wait until 2004, your appraisal will be ongoing every year and you will not be kept waiting for it all the time. Furthermore, your appraisal will be in true school report style: firm but fair, and we will adopt the same approach to this programme, which is very ambitious. I hope that you will have delivered at least part of it by the end of this year.

Mr President, hearing the debate unfold and watching my colleagues and the clock, I am not sure what I want any more: protected areas for fauna, flora and habitats or protected areas for ecologically minded delegates. At the moment, I am more interested in protected areas for delegates, but that is another matter. Our question to you, Commissioner, has another purpose. I would have liked to hear your answer first, but you have chosen to speak at the end of the debate. We are discussing something here of which most know the history. The fauna-flora-habitats legislation should have been implemented by 1994 – it is now the year 2000. The European Union list of the relevant nature conservation sites should have been ready in 1998 – it is now the year 2000. The Member States should have notified the Commission of their sites by 1995 – it is now the year 2000. Many Member States, including my own, did not do as required. Germany, for example, implemented the legislation in 1998 instead of 1994 – only four years late. But what does it matter?! As a result, the European Union list is obviously not ready. And how could it be? Many Member States and many regions have not announced their sites. Now Mr Schnellhardt has even suggested that perhaps we made a mistake with the fauna-flora-habitats directive. Perhaps, Mr Schnellhardt, you are right that it wasn’t totally practical, it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t quite right. Unfortunately, however, it is not the procedure in the European Union that if you don’t like a piece of legislation you don’t bother observing it. If that were the case, then there would also be areas and matters which you and I would not like. But we do have this unfortunate system in the European Union – what you call legal certainty. We do have this unfortunate system – it is what you call legislation, which has been adopted in this European Parliament with the consent of the Member States. It must be observed! It might perhaps be a bit too strict and too legalistic, but that’s the way it is: we are living in a European Union with a legal system. Mr Jarzembowski is the one who supports this most of all because he comes from Hamburg which is one of the few regions of Germany to be nominated, along with Berlin, my own area, although as city states we have it particularly easy, I think I can say with some justification. However, I do not want to pass sentence on Mr Schnellhardt, who comes from one of the new federal states who do not have things quite so good. That is an internal German problem which we will resolve at another time and in another place in the House. Today, Mr President, we are talking about the fact that Europe is losing its countryside and about the fact that Europe must observe legal certainty. I shall come to my final point: Commissioner, it you do not succeed in going to the European Court of Justice and bringing to account those Member States which are not properly implementing legislation, you will lose your authority and your legitimacy. You must do it! If you think the legislation is no good, let us revise it. If you think it is sound, go to the European Court of Justice, and be quick about it!

Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you
 take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your
 benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices? You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections. When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say? Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new? There is nothing new in your work programme. You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year’s work programme. Does that give me hope for the year 2000? No, it does not! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever. You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas. Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year? No, you have not done so. You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement. Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market. You have not integrated it anywhere. You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure. You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored. You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation. Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about. The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world. Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring. It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties. It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day’s work to be done. That is what we expect of you in the next five years.

Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection. We therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs. The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion. Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points. First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base. Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned. Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis. If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it. The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people’s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission’s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection. My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise. Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation. If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation. The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37. Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs. We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law. We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled. The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign. I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs. It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States. There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.

Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets. Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail. And it is still on the agenda today. It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report. The cast is always the same. Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament. My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one. I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal. That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done. I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House. At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now. But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing. This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about. Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report. Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with – and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future – is relatively simple. It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne. When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked. Questions will be asked – questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee – on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries. How will BSE status in fact be defined then? Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test? And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test? When will you make it compulsory? Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report. Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test. I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job. I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings. Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous. That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little. You are lucky that Mr Böge’s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so. Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne. We have a new Commission. Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell. But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes. They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult. But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this. In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text. And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement. I have three short questions, the first being as follows. We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice. Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market? I am sure that your answer to this will be “yes” but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be? My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example? Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation? In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?

 Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions! Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest. Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do. I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union. I have good reason for asking this. As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence. How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes? How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you? That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!

Madam President, my apologies; I rarely ask for the floor in this sort of situation but I do this also to make an appeal to the House. With all due respect to Mr Sturdy, I consider that his complaint against Mr Byrne is not quite fair because, in the final analysis, we asked Mr Byrne to present the White Paper on food safety. It is a highly complicated paper and cannot be dealt with in ten minutes. Mr Byrne took 15 or 17 minutes to do so and then some of us asked questions, some of which took longer than one minute. I took less than a minute, others took more. It is up to us to ensure that the Commission has an hour, not half an hour to explain its position and that we then have sufficient time to hold a debate on it. What Mr Provan said is indeed correct. I was here in plenary from 3.00 p.m. yesterday and it was we, the Parliament, who put the Erika
 oil disaster on the agenda and we, the Parliament, who put the storms in Europe on the agenda. As a result, we all talked for longer under vice-presidents Colom and Provan. It was Parliament’s fault that we ran over so badly. The vice-presidents had a difficult job and I think it is unfair to blame the Commissioner because Mr Byrne had to wait and suffered as a result. It is up to us to change our agenda and be more disciplined. (Applause)

Mr President, having heard such ambitious and important statements in the area of foreign policy and employment policy, I am almost ashamed at having to express something in the nature of regret. But I must do so nonetheless. I have read your programme of work and I have listened to you very carefully. I can only wish that there were as much ambition in the areas on which I work here in the European Parliament, in the areas of environmental policy, consumer protection and health policy, as there is in the others. I understand that a presidency cannot work everywhere and be ambitious everywhere at once, and I respect the fact that you have placed the focus elsewhere. Nonetheless, I cannot let you get away with it so easily, as I am sure you will understand, and I should like to make a few comments on this. You have set great store in your written programme and in what you have said today on food safety. I think that is important. Parliament will be dealing with the White Paper on food safety. The Minister pointed out that the summit in June will address this White Paper. I hope that you have sufficient respect for the European Parliament to wait for Parliament to debate the issue and adopt its resolutions and I doubt that this will be the case by June. We shall, of course, gladly try to do so in order to accommodate the Portuguese Council Presidency. You also set great store by the water framework directive. Here too I ask you: if you would only accept the proposed amendments which Parliament will be adopting at the beginning of February, then we will be well on the way to agreement. Allow me to say something else. You mentioned that you want to link environmental policy with regional planning. I support you in that with all my heart. You have the opportunity to ensure at the Intergovernmental Conference that the new Treaty gives Europe powers in regional planning. Then you will have us on your side straight away. But will you implement it? I doubt it. However, I shall support you nevertheless. Finally, I should like to say this to you. Please take care to ensure in the areas of environmental policy and integration in other policy areas that an undertaking to do this is given and proven. Please pass this on to your colleagues in the Member States and please ensure that the legislation is transposed. That is not always the case with environmental legislation. And if you do that, then, although you have perhaps not announced as much as others, you will have done your job properly and I wish you the best of luck with it.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past. We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union. That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: “you must push this through in the Council of Ministers”. Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods. So what are we to do now? I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future. What are we to do now? I will tell you a few things we should do. Of course, we need double-hulled vessels. That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term. So what do we need to happen immediately? We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate. We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years. If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle. This is what we need for ships. Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union. Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges. We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union’s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor. Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate. We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability. We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability. This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision! I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability. In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries. Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future. Environmental standards will be a recurring theme. I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports. The unions will have something to say as will industry. A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen. I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement. Just you go home and say: “ we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date”. We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports. We need to have a long memory when we say: “ for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union.” If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years’ time!

 Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority. My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed. You are unclear about this in your White Paper. What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list? When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof? The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States? That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

Madam President, it distresses me greatly to have to contradict Mr von Wogau and it perhaps distresses me even more to have to contradict Mr Goepel, but let me take the formal part first. The formal part is that we agreed and decided on the agenda this morning. Mr von Wogau, you are a great stickler for procedure, even more so than I. I am perhaps on occasions somewhat more relaxed, which is why I think it is important that we keep to this agenda. The second argument is that, apart from the fact that Mr Byrne will probably arrive at any moment, we should be clear Mr von Wogau – and this is a fact, as you well know – that nothing which we say today will come as a surprise to Mr Byrne. We can always ask Mr Byrne questions afterwards. As to the first part of what you said, Mr von Wogau, I would ask you to have a little respect for Members’ engagements, i.e. the engagements of those of us who have perhaps put off other things in order to be present here and the engagements of other Members who have not yet had time to prepare for a different debate. Now to what Mr Goepel said. Mr Goepel, as to what the Council is doing, allow me to say to you quite plainly that that is the second part of the debate which is to follow, namely the report by Mr Papayannakis on beef labelling. What the Council is doing is a matter of indifference to me. This Parliament has the right of codecision on this proposal. This Parliament has the right to decide alone. If the Council thinks it should be present, fine. If the Council does not think it should be present, so much the better, because we shall take the decision here which we consider to be right; if necessary, we may even go to the European Court of Justice and then decide. Then we shall consider how to deal with the Council. I do not need a Council representative here in order to tell them that I think they are undemocratic. We can say that afterwards in the debate. I think it is important that we proceed with the agenda as it now stands.

Madam President, at this moment in time, Socialist members have been debating BSE far longer than most of you and, in all events, far longer than Mr Stevenson, but that is just a brief rejoinder to the last comment. As chairman of the last BSE committee, I have probably spoken more frequently in this House and in other fora on BSE than most of you since 1996/97. I believe therefore that many of you will already have heard much of what I have to say here today from me on previous occasions. Permit me nonetheless to summarise the background to the lifting of the export ban. The lifting of the export ban on British beef followed long scientific debate, long reports and numerous inspection visits to the United Kingdom and was approved by this Parliament. We now have a legal situation where there is an internal market and free movement of goods. Only where there is scientifically substantiated and provable cause for concern can the free movement of goods be excluded and suspended in order to protect consumer health. This applies to all Member States and it also applies in other respects. However, as this scientific proof always takes the form of an up-to-date expert opinion based on the information available, we must all take an interest in the latest scientific knowledge. Like most of you, I am no scientist. I must refer to the expert opinions of the scientists and I am interested in any new information which may cast fresh light on the situation. I was therefore most interested and curious to know what new information was available. Unfortunately, no new information has come to my attention either from France and other Member States or – and this remark is addressed directly at Mr Stevenson – from Germany. The reaction is therefore quite clear and unequivocal. Commissioner Byrne and the Commission have chosen the only correct reaction. Member States call time and again for legal security in the European Union, Member States call time and again for everyone else to respect the law when their own interests are at stake. And so there should be no exceptions for them either and there should be no arbitrariness in the European legal systems. Nonetheless, it would have been nice if the Commission had made the BSE test evaluated several months ago compulsory, i.e. if they had made it a duty incumbent upon all Member States. That would have given some Member States additional security and additional reassurance and all the Member States would at last obtain a clear and unequivocal picture. Then we would finally know exactly what the BSE situation is. My question therefore to Commissioner Byrne is this: when will we have a proposal on compulsory BSE testing in the Member States? Apart from BSE testing, we also need a record of provenance. We shall shortly be debating the Papayannakis report on beef labelling. This, too, would simplify and improve the situation of the Member States and help to protect consumers. Here too, and I say this loud and clear, the Member States have been dragging their feet. They have been dragging their feet since 1997 and the Commission has also failed to take the necessary action. That is inexcusable. Allow me to conclude with a few words on consumer protection as a whole. I have been in the European Parliament for 10 years, during which most of my time has been taken up with environmental policy and consumer protection. I do not always have the support of the Member States, despite hearing so much from them about consumer protection. May I remind you of the legislation on product safety and product liability, where I tried to obtain legal security. However, I was ignored by countries such as Germany, France and others when it came to protecting victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the longer-term. I would have wished for more consumer protection and more support than I mustered. Perhaps there is now a new trend in consumer protection. I call on the Commission and on you, Mr Byrne, to pass your homework on to the Member States. The Council is usually pretty dozy. All the members of the Council are usually pretty dozy. Make BSE testing compulsory and ensure that beef is labelled with its origin, that would be a major step forward.

 Mr President, I shall not now echo the compliments paid to Mr Lamy or he will start to blush. I take it that he is aware that this House is also grateful for the part he played and for the way in which he involved the European Parliament delegation. With your permission, I shall comment on the consequences of the failure of this ministerial conference. What conclusions should we draw in terms of continuing the work? One thing is certain: whether there is another ministerial conference now or whether work has to proceed on a step-by-step basis, never again can another working round be allowed to open without there being a clear agenda which has been put to the vote and agreed. This must surely be one of the consequences. If we are now to continue the work solely on the basis of Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, what then are our responsibilities under the agreement? I am convinced that they are perfectly obvious: Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture contains the condition that, amongst other things, non-trade-related concerns are also to be taken into account. For this reason, at every step, at all the negotiations, the precautionary principle must be constantly reiterated; it must be put repeatedly on the agenda as if this were a Tibetan prayer wheel. Each of the speakers here keeps repeating the words: consumer protection, precautionary principle and environment policy, but then we also need to make this clear. We also need to make it clear that environmental standards and food safety are often hotly disputed here, that it is only with difficulty that we achieve this here in the European Union, that the legislation is controversial, and that if we have adopted it, it is because of our responsibility to the people of the European Union – to whom we are accountable as elected parliamentarians – and not for reasons of tactical protectionism. We also need to make this clear. From now on, it must go without saying that extending individual parts of the WTO rules or overhauling them completely can only be possible once this institution is at long last democratic, once it is transparent and once it is less authoritarian. Perhaps the failure of this first WTO Ministerial Conference is also a huge blessing in disguise because the arrogance and lack of democracy has been exposed and now we have an opportunity to change it. The time is right to do so!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the Millennium Round and its opening is to be a success, then we must immediately address and pin down some basic problems. These are of course areas – and I shall mention a few of them – determined by the Environment Committee where, in the past, we have found deficiencies, areas where there are loopholes, areas where we noticed snags and catches. I will now mention a few of the most important of these areas which the Environment Committee has determined and which it considers to be important. For example, as regards the precautionary principle, this must be clearly defined and we must have a definition as adopted at the Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio. This precautionary principle must be anchored in the WTO rules and regulations in a legally binding manner. Secondly, it must be possible to implement, for example, the Multilateral Environment Agreement without triggering conflicts with the WTO. Thirdly, the issue of providing information to consumers on preparation and production methods, commonly referred to as PPMs, and the possibility for Member States to take non-discriminatory measures. These issues must be included in the WTO negotiations. Allow me to say something on the dispute settlement procedure. The dispute settlement procedure, with which we have always had so many problems in the past, and many dispute procedures which we did have concerned the areas of environmental policy, consumer protection and animal protection, must become more transparent. It must ensure that scientific expertise is independent and unambiguous and then it must also be recognised. It must not be the case, as with hormones, that the European Union is able to provide scientific expertise on the danger of hormones whilst we are obliged to pay compensation. Such situations must not be repeated in the future. I have only mentioned a few of the most important points which my colleagues designate time and again as being important, because everyone will keep saying that in the World Trade Organisation environmental issues and consumer protection issues must be cited as a central theme. I would like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues in the Industry Committee, and this does not go without saying and is not always the case, for incorporating many of the points which were determined in the Environment Committee in the final report, for including them in the amendments of the rapporteur and in the compromise amendments so that much of what the Environment Committee considers important for Seattle has been taken up in the report of Mr Schwaiger. Mr Lamy, I therefore now ask you and the Commission to take up these points which I have mentioned here, and also more comprehensive points, to cement these basic points in the opening round and to ensure that in the Millennium Round in the coming years we can further develop them so that the World Trade Organisation is what we would like it to be – a social, just, environmentally-friendly trade organisation which allows us to conduct trade whilst allowing our people and our environment to exist.

Mr President, Commissioner, I share your belief that this is a problem which must be handled extremely carefully. You rightly stated that we must take scientific opinions seriously and I assume that British farmers wish to sell safe beef as soon as possible and not wait two years until they can do so. For this reason, no one in this House, nor indeed anyone at all, can really want to see treaty infringement proceedings which will take two to three years and create nothing but uncertainty in the European Union during this time. Mr Byrne, can you tell me how you will be able to ensure that objections at a scientific level are investigated in the shortest possible time so that Member States are not able to repeatedly raise objections and to apply laws without needing to prove their case? Can you also tell me that you will make clear to Germany that you are expecting constitutional barriers, such as a resolution of the Bundesrat
 at the earliest possible opportunity? Mr Byrne, finally I would like to ask one more question which I have already asked in Brussels. Would you please be a little clearer about the issue of testing? When will you present the House with a proposal to prescribe BSE testing as compulsory in the European Union?
Roth-Behrendt (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, do you agree with me that it really is astonishing that Member States are now seeking fresh explanations and clarifications when this has been the subject of discussions with the same Member States in the Standing Veterinary Committee for over a year and a half, and do you agree that Member States still imposing a ban on imports should present fresh scientific evidence, failing which it simply gives the impression that they want to push the internal market still further into some distant future? Do you also agree with me that you should make it compulsory, immediately – or rather in the next four weeks – for those Member States and all others to universally apply the newly evaluated BSE tests. No doubt the two Member States who still have an import ban will support you in this! Lastly, do you agree with me that even if there were – were, that is a subjunctive – if there were such an agency of the kind that Mr Prodi would like and which has not yet been fully discussed in this House, even if that were the case, a situation like this could recur again and again? The reason being, of course, that there would still be national agencies that could, at any time, claim that there was new scientific evidence. Would you therefore agree that your hope that a European agency could avoid such a situation is quite simply an illusion?
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, in the short time I have left, I would just like to make a few key points. What do we need to do in terms of form? We must change the process for the settlement of disputes within the World Trade Organisation. We must make it more transparent, clearer and more accessible to the public. This is one of the most important conditions necessary for ensuring that areas such as the protection of the environment and of the consumer are given their rightful place, and are not ridden roughshod over in some panel.  Concerning the areas that are included, Mr Lamy, the most important of all is the precautionary principle. I have already said this on many occasions. We must take the precautionary principle from the trade agreement on plant health and apply it to the Agreement. So what then do we really need? We need policies on the environment and health to be important and proper components of the Agreement. The achievements of the World Trade Organisation’s committee on trade and the environment are not enough. It has not so far fulfilled its duties and must be penalised. It must be given a clear timetable so that it can give support to the various projects.  What are the most important areas that we really have to deal with? We must do what the Commission itself asks. We must make the whole World Trade Organisation more open, more democratic and more transparent and we must ensure that the whole contract underlying it can be subjected, as you yourself say, to a study on its environmental acceptability. We must examine production methods that are not tied to products and we must have an overview of the situation. I am convinced that this Parliament will not ratify another agreement in which the precautionary principle, consumer protection and health policies do not play an important part.

 Madam President, Mr Prodi, I know that I was not very forbearing with you at the last part-session. I am therefore saying today, quite openly too, that I should like to have heard the speech you made today before now. It was very good. If you also really mean what you just said, then you may yet become a hero of mine. You have not occupied that position in the past, but I am prepared to think again. Until now, I have only wanted to place David Byrne in that position.  What, then, are we talking about here today, Mr Prodi? You have made it clear. We are talking about the safety of our citizens, about health and about consumer protection in the European Union. Let me, therefore, touch upon three points to which you also referred to some extent in your speech. First of all, what we call the precautionary principle. This must be the dominant goal of the policy of the European Union and of all its institutions. I shall give you an example, Mr Prodi, which you will certainly understand. This principle must be as important for us in the European Union and have as high a priority as, for example, the criterion of price stability for the European Central Bank. Have you understood this? I hope so, Mr Prodi. The Member States have not understood this. The Council has still not understood it. It is also your task to get this message across. We shall do our bit. That you can be certain of. The Council and the Member States are still light years away from this attitude. Therefore, work together with us in this area.  Secondly: what does the precautionary principle actually mean? It is about closing the loopholes that still exist in legislation. You therefore referred to a White Paper which David Byrne presented at the hearing in the European Parliament and for which we were very grateful to him. What ought this White Paper to contain? It must be very ambitious, Mr Prodi. I would quote here for you, in summary form only, a number of tasks which must be indispensable component parts of this White Paper. These include safeguard clauses for foodstuffs. At present, the European Commission is still not allowed to issue any safeguard clauses relating to foodstuffs. It only has this right in the veterinary field, and that is a flaw.  Let us consider the area of supervisory authority. When it comes to supervision in third countries, we may not exercise any supervisory authority in respect, for example, of fruit and vegetables. This is a shortcoming. Consider the so-called rapid alert system, the early warning system. This must be improved. You touched upon this subject, and I am grateful to you for doing so. However, I should also like to tell you how it can be improved. It must be made transparent. At present, the Member States pass on information to the Commission in confidence. This means that you, Mr Prodi, and you, Mr Byrne, have no right at all to inform our citizens about any dangers. This must be changed. This is not the sort of transparency which you and I value. This is not an instance of keeping the public informed.  It must be possible to improve the ways in which supervision is itself controlled in the Member States. The supervisory office in Dublin must have the ability to exercise supervisory authority in the Member States as soon as there are grounds for suspicion, and it must also have investigative powers. We need legislation in connection with feedingstuffs. You have referred to this subject, and I say again that we need a positive list and we need supervisory controls in the field of feedingstuffs. We do not have any of this. We need the duty of declaration, something which I and my colleagues, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Böge, have been demanding since the BSE scandal.  All this, Mr Prodi, must be achieved by the Commission before the end of 1999. It is on this basis that I shall be assessing whether you really want to achieve your ambitious goals. You have time before the end of the year to complete this White Paper. We in the European Parliament will then have time in the year 2000 to work on this. That is our task. We must change and improve the systems of supervision and monitoring. We have established that they do not work. For example, I am still calling for a dioxin register. I have already done this once before in this Chamber. We need a dioxin register which also includes other sources of dioxin such as incinerating plants and other facilities. In this way, you can see the close, two-way connection between environmental policy and consumer protection and vice versa. The two cannot be separated. The one is crucial to the other. How can it be, Mr Prodi, that fish for human consumption may have higher dioxin levels than meat? You need to change this. The reports on residual matter which the Member States have, after a fashion, submitted to the Commission in recent years must be checked more thoroughly and more quickly. On the subject of antibiotics, why has more still not been done, Mr Prodi? We have known for months that a number of antibiotics in animal feed produce forms of resistance in humans. I therefore urge you to do something now, before the end of the year. Mr Florenz has touched on the subject of pesticides. There are more and more reports about the damage done to health and the environment by obsolete pesticides which no longer make sense in scientific terms. We need regulations to ensure that these are harmless.  I come now, Mr Prodi, to your, and my, favourite subject, and to the end of my speech. This is the third of my three points and concerns your “agency”. I put inverted commas around this, however the interpreters may translate these. What, then, do we want, Mr Prodi? What do you and I want? We want the best scientific expertise, we want transparency in everything and we want safe and harmless products for the citizens of the European Union. Is that what we have then Mr Prodi? I say to you, “yes”, we have a large part of this. During the BSE scandal, we ensured that the European Union’s scientific committees were restructured and that scientists are now appointed under an open appointments system, that their past careers and financial interests are known about and that the agendas, minutes and also minority opinions expressed are published on the Internet. That is what I want. I want transparency at a high level.  I do not, however, want what I fear you yourself want. I do not want industry exercising influence. You mentioned as an example the Medical Agency in London. It has the task of authorising drugs produced through biotechnology, and that is how it earns its money. If you make an agency responsible for doing this, then it is also responsible to industry. That is the wrong way to proceed, Mr Prodi, and I hope that you too will appreciate this very soon. With regard to what you are proposing, we must make it quite clear that we do not only want scientific expertise but also the exercise of supervision. If you were to discover today in the Commission, Mr Prodi, that there was a problem area in relation to the protection of plants, then you would have to be able to call upon the scientists to organise an investigation quickly, and I should like to be able to exercise supervision over them. Whatever else is created, there must therefore be a body of some kind, a subordinate authority. Whether we establish this on your own premises, Mr President, or at the joint research centre which we already have in the European Union or whether we locate it somewhere else, it is all the same to me. For me, the important things are supervision and transparency.  Finally, I would say Mr Prodi (and with this I end my speech) that if we want to ensure that our citizens regain the confidence of which you have spoken, then we must be democratic. I assume, Mr Prodi, that this proposal for an agency, as you call it, is to be put before Parliament. You said that you had still not decided. Then I can only say that you have been lucky! It is this Chamber which must decide, and it is not you in the Commission who decides. In this way, we shall certainly arrive at a satisfactory solution. Thank you for your attention.  (Applause)

 Mr President, I have asked my group to again give me the opportunity at the end of this debate to elucidate a number of points arising from it. Let me now again emphasise, Mr Prodi, that what you have talked about – and what has also in part become clear from many other interventions – is something which you ought to, if you would, take home with you. For us, there are three essential points. We need good, proper legislation, and we need it quickly. There is one thing you must do in connection with this, Mr Prodi: you must also put your own house in order. It is just not acceptable that responsibilities should be scattered among different Directorates-General with the result that no healthy, sensible legislation comes into being. It is not acceptable that Directorate-General III should be responsible for processed food, drugs and genetically-modified organisms and that Directorate-General XXIV should also have a portion of responsibility for these while Directorates-General VI and XI should retain a small portion of responsibility for feedingstuffs. This is just not on, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to regulate the situation in a sensible way. Legislative powers belong inevitably with whatever Directorate-General is responsible for consumer protection and health policy.  What is more, we have established in this debate that we need good scientific advice. Many of our colleagues have referred to this and have said that we need an independent, authoritative advisory body. I would say again that any such advisory body must not be influenced by Member States or the interests of industry, Mr Prodi, and it ought not to have any powers to lay down regulations. This power lies with the European Parliament alone and, in a small number of exceptional cases, with the Commission in its comitological proceedings. Nowhere else! We must be in agreement about this. We then come to the subject of supervision, Mr Prodi. When we have all this – that is to say when we have good, healthy, sensible and integrative legislation, together with good scientific advice – we still need supervision. I would ask you to make it clear to the Member States that supervision cannot be had for free. In recent years, the Member States have neglected their obligation to implement legislation and supervise production. They have never really reported to us about how many supervisors in the Member States supervise what, when and where. It is, however, their duty to do this, and you, Mr Prodi, must convey this unpleasant news to the Member States. When the Member States in fact carry out what should have been their task for a long time, namely to check that food does not poison us but enables us to live, then we still have a supervisory authority at the Commission. We have the Control Office, or the Foodstuffs and Veterinary Office, which reports to Mr Byrne’s department and which has its headquarters in Dublin. In the Committee on Budgets, we have just now decided that this body should have more departments so that it can carry out its supervisory tasks. I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to lend your support to the idea that this body in Dublin should be able to visit the Member States without warning, that it should have investigative powers and that it should be able to carry out its task of overseeing the relevant supervisory arrangements in the Member States.  Once these three goals have been achieved, that is to say, once we have designed sensible legislation, have access to scientific advice at a high level and are properly carrying out the relevant supervision, only then are we really on the safe side. Then, we shall have a system unlike any other in the world. We shall then also be able to go to the WTO negotiations in Seattle and say: everything is above board, we are not practising protectionism, we are enabling our citizens to live healthily and that is what we also want for you in the United States and in the developing countries. We want to cooperate in what we do. This, however, is our task: that we should put our house in order, as we already have done in a sense. It is still not perhaps perfect in every detail. We are, however, getting there. We must, then, also make this clear outside the European Union in the negotiations which will begin with the Millennium Round. I believe that we shall then be able to say to our citizens: nothing is ever guaranteed in life, but we are providing you with the highest possible levels of safety, well-being and health that, as far as anyone can judge and on the basis of scientific advice, we can offer at present. If that is your stated goal, Mr Prodi, then you will be a successful President of the Commission.

 Ladies and gentlemen, those of you who have been Members of this Parliament in previous years know that there are very few people in this House who have concerned themselves so labour- intensively and, one might almost say, as enthusiastically with the question of the safety of meat, particularly British beef, as I did when I was the chair of the last BSE Committee. A report once said that I ought to know every single cow in Great Britain by name. That is not the case. Herr Schmid thinks I know every other cow by name, well that is not true either, but I do know at least some of them. I am the last person who wants to see unsafe meat anywhere in the European Union. This Parliament saw to it that the Committee of Enquiry was set up. We took care to ensure that, within the scope of the BSE debate, loopholes which still existed in many areas of legislation on foodstuffs were eliminated. Parliament can be proud, on the whole, of what it has achieved in the last five years. But we achieved it by working seriously and rationally. That means, among other things, doing one thing at a time and in a well-founded way. I am full of sympathy for fellow Members when they complain that one Member State is not complying with Union legislation. Indeed, I am thankful that my own country, Germany, was not criticised some time ago for a similar attempt. Madam President, on your interesting initiative, we will have a comprehensive debate on food safety tomorrow, that is to say, on food safety as a whole. There is so much more to it than meat; there is so much more to it than dioxins or sludge or swine fever. It is a debate on the safety and quality of foodstuffs. This is why we also wish, at some time in the future, to discuss food safety in the European Union with the President of the Commission himself, Mr Prodi. If we wish to take away the comprehensive nature of the debate, if we wish to change this debate, then the easiest way to do so would be to add the British beef issue to the proceedings. Then tomorrow, we will have yet another debate on BSE. I would happily run such a debate! I have no problem with that. I even believe I know the many files almost off by heart. I could do it. But I do not think that we should do that. I believe for a quite different reason that we should not do that. Two days ago, the French food agency expressed doubts regarding the safety of British beef. I have not yet read any document on the subject. I have not yet seen anything in writing on the subject. The appropriate committees on agriculture or the environment have not yet had time to look into the matter. I would like to have a serious debate on the matter. I therefore request, Madam President, that we do not debate the question tomorrow but rather in two weeks time, if it is still necessary, so that the appropriate committees can look into the matter, and that tomorrow we should debate the topic on the agenda, i.e. foodstuffs ... (The President cut the speaker off)
Roth-Behrendt (PSE

 Mr President, honoured colleagues, if we are talking today about the future Commission, then we are also talking about our political priorities. And what do these include, Mr Prodi? They incorporate areas of life which are among the most significant for human beings and which are of importance every day for us and our children. Examples include clean air and drinkable water, safe food which does not poison people, the safeguarding of their personal economic interests and the development of a basic standard of health within the European Union. In the course of the hearings before the relevant committees, Margot Wallström and David Byrne have shown brilliantly and convincingly, as well as to the satisfaction of the committees, that these priorities have been recognised and that full commitment will be given to this policy and to its fulfilment. How, though, do such policy areas become political realities and priorities? That can only happen with the support of the whole Commission around the Commission table and with the support of the President of the Commission, that is to say of yourself, Mr Prodi. So, can we be hopeful? I have been asking myself that question for a number of days now and, Mr Prodi, I have been asking it whenever I hear a speech by you. That is four or five in all now. I will also tell you the answer. I am not hopeful. My impression is that, in the past, you have merely been paying lip service. And because it was too much trouble, you do not do it at all now. In your speech today, you did not say a word, not a single word, about environmental policy. You mentioned sustainable development once. This is a compulsory exercise which everyone engages in. You did not say a word, not a single word, about consumer protection and safe food. And that is after BSE and dioxin! You used the word “health” in connection with the economy and sport. You betray your ignorance here, Mr Prodi, not that of your Commission, merely your own. Mrs Wallström and Mr Byrne have quite clearly come through their examinations before the European Parliament with flying colours. But they will probably often feel themselves to be alone around the Commission table, for you, Mr Prodi, have no idea about the interests of people inside the European Union despite the fact that you are always spouting about the “European soul”. You say you have learned lessons. So what lessons have you learned, Mr Prodi, other than that enterprise is important? You have shown in the past that you do not seriously mean what you say, and so you no longer say anything at all. I am telling you quite clearly, Mr Prodi, you have not passed the examination as far as I am concerned. So far, you have clearly failed it. So if I vote “yes” tomorrow, it is because of your esteemed colleagues, Mr Prodi, and not because of you. If, when voting, I was able to differentiate between yourself and your colleagues, you would get a clear “no” and all the others a clear “yes”. In football, a good team with a bad coach would never reach the top of the league. I only hope that the future Commission will overturn this rule.

 Mr President, let me begin by giving Mr Prodi a sound piece of advice, both him and all the other nominees who wish to be confirmed in their positions by this House here in September. One of the questions which all of the committees certainly wish to ask is this: What is your attitude towards honouring decisions made by the European Parliament? If Mr Prodi or one of the other nominees replies, ‘Well, I couldn"t care less’, then these nominees will have a problem. Yesterday, in his third speech to this House, Mr Prodi used the words ‘consumer protection’ and ‘health policy’ for the first time. That is a fair few. In this regard, he also said that he would make provision for, and I quote, ‘an independent European Food and Drugs Agency’. This House decided, after long discussions in connection with the BSE crisis, that this is something which we simply do not want. We are not after an independent Agency but an authority which is subordinate to the Commission and which is accountable to this House, the European Parliament. (Applause)  I hope that this piece of information reaches Mr Prodi so that he knows in future to be very careful about what he says. I have already asked Mr Fischler yesterday whether this was his suggestion. He assured me that it was not. Mr Fischler, I believe this to be the case and, after your speech here today, which I thought was excellent, I am even more convinced. I would now like to say something to the President-in-Office of the Council. He said at certain points that the Council was concerned that the dioxin crisis has shown that its effects concern the Union as a whole and that the Council wants to act decisively and responsibly. Mr President, I believe that it would be something new if the Council were to act decisively and responsibly. I hope that the Finnish Presidency of the Council will actually bring this about. You would then be able to count a complete novelty amongst the successes of your Presidency. Up to now, the Council has routinely covered things up, dithered, and swept things under the carpet. (Applause)  So let"s get down to business. Everyone in the Council knows that individual countries all handle things in a similar manner. What has happened in Belgium, and it is a disgrace that it took the government six weeks to inform the Commission, could have happened anywhere else. It was just bad luck that it happened in Belgium. We all know that it could have occurred in Italy, Germany or Austria. Have you, for example, done anything to help ensure tighter inspections and controls? You have left untouched a proposal from the European Parliament on this matter for more than six months. As far as the details of this crisis are concerned, I would like to expressly commend the Commission. We have certainly frequently maintained, in connection with BSE, that the Commission was not quite on the ball. But at the same time, however, there is nothing, nothing at all, as regards the behaviour of the Commission for which it can be criticised. Everything the Commission did, and the way in which it was done, was excellent. The same certainly cannot be said of everybody else. So what lessons can be drawn from this? Mr Fischler mentioned some of these. He made reference to legislation which is necessary. This is definitely the case. There is no question that other legislation for animal feed products is required. We have to avoid a situation where, for example, waste products enter into animal feed. We talk of foodstuffs and animals which have been fed on these foodstuffs. Waste products have no part here. Mr Fischler, of course there should not be dioxin limit values. The limit value has to be zero for both dioxins and PCB. We should therefore be very careful as regards both the wording and the language. In this regard, something else is worthy of mention. Let"s have the courage to also declare dioxin to be a worldwide problem. Will there be a dioxin register in the European Union and worldwide? Will it be investigated where emissions accumulate from incineration plants, where other dioxin emissions can be found which are present in the soil and in the grass which is eaten by animals? We know for sure that they are not only found in animal feed but also in our natural environment. So please let"s have a dioxin register. This is something that is definitely needed. I would now like to briefly outline some proposals relating to the checks. If we do not ensure that the tests are better carried out in Member States, if the Commission is not able to carry out inspections unannounced, but first has to wait for permission from a Member country such as Belgium or another Member State, we can forget it. We must modify the inspection process and agricultural policy as a whole. If we believe that we can make high profits by means of waste products which are as cheap as possible, and that is something which we want, such cases will always crop up. We have to change this within the European Union as well as with our partners outside the Union. (Applause)

 Mr President, here too we find a similar lack of logic, and so I ask that, by analogy with paragraph 13, the following words, which I shall now read out, should be deleted: ‘including the completion of the transatlantic market’. I also ask that the following be deleted: ‘aimed at achieving the free movement of goods, capital, service and persons’. In this instance, too, I ask for Mr Brok's agreement to this.

 Mr President, I think Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and my colleague Mrs McNally have both done a very good job of explaining their divergent positions. Whenever there is a situation of problematic political conflict – and it goes without saying that Israel is one – this House finds it difficult to come to a decision. I do believe, though, that it is a good thing to clarify what is involved, what we want to achieve, and what message this House is sending out by endorsing the position taken by the Commission and the Council. This has to do with the continuation of cooperation and dialogue that are already going on in scientific and technological circles, and that benefit both sides. Contrary to what has been said by some Members, this is not just about the eventual benefit to Israel; we too will benefit. Not only will this benefit scientists, university departments and research institutes; humanity itself will benefit from cooperation and exchange between scientists, in which politicians too will have their part to play, and, as a fellow Member pointed out, society as a whole will benefit. We are investing in a future in which – or so we hope – Europe will be able to do its bit in resolving a situation that is, in political and human terms, extremely difficult. So I am both proud and glad that Mrs McNally, as my group’s coordinator, has, in the group’s discussions, always emphasised that we would endorse this report. On just one small point, I would like to point out to the Members in the Group of the Greens, who have difficulties with the ‘dual use’ 
aspect,
 that the European Union does not support any military research, nor does our research programme cover it, so any cooperation in that area is automatically ruled out.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler, I would like to pick up on two brief comments that the two Commissioners made this morning. Commissioner Lamy remarked that we were, so to speak, passing from the technical stage to the political stage of the negotiating process, since officials had, in December, come to a sort of agreement as to how negotiations were to be proceeded with, although it is still not yet clear how the political negotiators can actually put that into an active working calendar. The second comment that I found very interesting was from Commissioner Fischler, who said what we would do, and added that it would not be at any price. That is, of course, an allusion to the European agenda and to the issue of how our thinking can have any influence in the context of the WTO negotiations. What, though – if I may make so bold as to ask the two Commissioners – does that actually mean in concrete terms? Next year is an election year and a difficult one; you two will still be here in its first half, then things will get critical, and then – so to speak – you will no longer be there. We do not know who will be. The situation is similar on the American side – Bob Zoellick will not be coming back again either – and nor is the geostrategic situation straightforward; look at the way things are shaping up in India, look at China or at Brazil. So I ask you both: what do you now expect to happen, and how are you preparing yourselves for it? What is in your calendars for January, February, and March, and when do you think the political stage will begin? Now for my second question. Where is the pain barrier? Where do we really think it is? What is the ‘not at any price’ issue? The Singapore issues? I think not. Agriculture? Perhaps, but I have seen the draft working document on the market organisation for sugar. Will you, Commissioner, produce a final draft by the end of your term of office? You see, where is our pain barrier? If we know a bit more about that, I believe we might perhaps be able to be a bit more proactive in steering the process that you all and we all want. In relation to that, please allow me to put a final question to the two Commissioners: what do you now, really, think of Bob Zoellick’s latest venture? I heard brief indications that you take a positive view of it, but could you go into more detail about just how positive?

 Mr President, my fellow Members have already pointed out, and it has become apparent indirectly, how difficult the negotiations were in Geneva. The World Summit on the Information Society demonstrated yet again that international negotiations, regardless of the framework in which they take place – whether it be the WTO or the UN – have become extremely complex. Mr 
Rübig’s appeal is quite right: we need more parliamentary involvement. That will not necessarily simplify the process, but it will at least demonstrate more clearly and tangibly the desire of citizens to be represented properly through a legitimate voice. In Geneva, it became apparent how such complex negotiations – in this instance, on the issue of how a global information society should be developed – can be shaped by the various actors. As a rule, these continue to be the governments, of course, and it is governments which draft the laws and have to negotiate at international level. In this instance, however, a great many companies and what has come to be known as ‘civil society’ were also involved. We must not forget that the Summit in Geneva nearly collapsed. It was extremely difficult to bring the negotiations to a conclusion at all. Anyone who reads the text and the compromise – and I would recommend it to everyone – can see how difficult it was to produce this compromise. I suspect that it will only be in Tunis that we recognise that we have a document before us that we can take back home and defend with some measure of credibility. Let me mention the most important issues that are at stake. Firstly, there is the issue of financing. Mr Cappato has mentioned that in the EU, we must proceed very cautiously when it comes to participating financially. We must consider which governments we are indirectly supporting, as they will have their own ideas on what constitutes an information society. Secondly, there is the issue of human rights. Here, the key issue is again freedom of information or constraints on access to the Internet. Naturally, there are many other issues as well. Cyber-security is one aspect that the European Union in particular has put on the agenda, and one where I hope we will be able to make a contribution through our own agency which we are currently setting up. Then there is the issue of Internet Governance, which is still unresolved. That is a sorry story even here in Europe. We have not even managed to launch our EU top level domain name successfully in the European arena. Finally, there are the issues of intellectual property rights and how open source can be developed. I felt it was important simply to mention these points. I hope that next year, we can address this topic again, and that this House will adopt a resolution on the matter before Tunis.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too would like to begin by congratulating Mr Paasilinna. I believe we have achieved a good compromise. In the many speeches that we have already heard, it has been described as a compromise, but as one that will indeed bring us, in the coming year, a European agency to deal with security issues throughout the Internet and its infrastructure. I believe that it was on this basis that we then all decided to simply try and reach a compromise that would take us through the first five years, although we were always aware that, after those five years, we would make a real attempt at creating genuine European structures and doing away with the problems that will now be inherent in the Agency. These have to do with voting rights, but also with the issue raised by the Member States, which will now, in fact, be represented by one person each. I nonetheless believe that, faced with the challenges in this area, each and every one of us will really try to determine what this agency’s tasks are. I have confidence in the promises made by the Italian presidency of the Council, and I think it will remember them even after five years. I hope that we will then all work towards making an early start on the audit that we have planned for – as early as after three years, if my memory serves me correctly – so that we can then make a start on rethinking the structures and defining the tasks more precisely. It is with reference to that, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I would like to put a question to you. Will you actually be coming back to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to discuss these tasks with its members as soon as you know how they are to be catalogued in collaboration with the Member States? The fact is that I suspect that this is not just about issues of security in the infrastructures – Members have already mentioned data security – but also about many other aspects that are equally affected, and initiating another wide-ranging discussion of these issues could be very interesting.

 I very much welcome Mr Linkohr’s own-initiative report on ‘Investing in research: an action plan for Europe’ and wish to express my personal thanks to him. I endorse his call for a significant increase in the amount of money spent on research in Europe with the aim of achieving the Lisbon targets, even though prompt transposition will be made difficult by the present tightness of many Member States’ budgets. If research in the EU is to be built up on a long-term basis, any increase in expenditure must therefore go hand in hand with greater efficiency in the application and management of the resources and with a more pronounced bias towards basic research. I am glad that the lead committee has agreed to my amendments in this regard. However, it also rejected the motion that what are termed the new instruments in the current Sixth Research Framework Programme should be drafted more rationally. This has led my own group to reintroduce Amendment 1, in which Parliament ‘calls, in the context of the 6th Research Framework Programme, for the ideas of 'networks of excellence' and 'integrated projects' to be geared more closely to the guiding notion of the European Research Area, and that adjustments, particularly in relation to the size of projects – both in terms of the number of project partners and of the financial volumes involved – should therefore be made.’ It is our expectation that this will enable, even now, the EU’s research policy to be adapted to the currently prevailing realities. I therefore ask you to adopt this amendment.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a similar position to Mr Daul, in that I too do not wish to repeat everything that has already been discussed, but I would like to say something about one comment made by the Italian Presidency. I think you were right to raise the issue of whether we are not really still in the ‘post-Seattle process’. You put it so neatly: from Seattle, via Doha, to Cancún. I think there is a lot in that. We had a situation in Seattle in which civil society tried, as part of anti-globalisation campaigns, to ask questions that we as a political institution have perhaps not always taken seriously enough or adequately addressed. That process has continued, and it has led to a general feeling of insecurity, insecurity not just limited to civil society but that has also reached far into the political institutions and also into many societies and states. We felt the same thing once again in Cancún in relation to the African states involved, and that feeling has even to some extent reached the G21 countries, who of course also attempted to mount a kind of revolt and to break this monopoly of power between Europe and the United States and perhaps also other nations. In view of that it may perhaps make very good sense for us to analyse further what actually happened and whether we are creating a reasonable basis for our new strategy. I do not share the self-pity that I rather sense here in this Chamber, that feeling that we are to blame for so much. I would like to congratulate the Commissioners. I think that their strategy was the right one and that we should not be heaping all the blame onto our own shoulders because it failed. I also believe that we should keep our options open. I certainly do not think that we should limit ourselves to the multilateral agenda, and those Members who know me will be aware of that. Sometimes it is a good thing to have several options, because you then have some scope for juggling your options. Sometimes one option is right and at other times a different one is. I am therefore in favour of keeping both options open. Furthermore, I hope that my fellow Member from Austria, Mr Paul Rübig, will address the House later. Unfortunately I have no more time left.

 Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Commissioner that, together with the Interparliamentary Union, the European Parliament will, as we have done before, be staging an event in Cancun. The object of the enterprise is that members of the parliaments of countries belonging to the WTO should meet together in order to exchange information. An additional consideration is that, in our view, many trade issues are moving further and further away from what have traditionally been considered as such, with which they formerly coincided, and touch on very sensitive areas that are of great interest to many members of the public. These include the service sector among many others. The event will be held in Cancun on 9 and 12 September, and this House will be playing a leading part in it, with many of our Members being present. We would of course be glad if all Members of this House with an interest in these matters were to circulate information about this event. Let me also address a second point, one raised by Mr Clegg, that being the issue of whether you will at all agree – whether or not the Convention so decides – that this House must approve the agreement negotiated in Cancun, no matter when or how it is concluded? Now for my third point. Might you consider reiterating today that Parliament is to give its approval and have – within the Article 133 Committee – a right equal to that of the Council to be involved and informed, and, furthermore, are you able to make a statement to the effect that Parliament should also have a part to play in allocating seats on it?

. – Mr President, a parallel process of regional integration has almost always accompanied the multilateral liberalisation of trade in the post-war period. In particular, the 1990's witnessed an exponential increase in the number of regional trade agreements being negotiated. Regionalism refers to the reaction by governments to liberalise or facilitate trade on a regional basis, sometimes through free trade areas or customs unions. In a double WTO context, regional trade agreements have both a broader meaning and a more specific one. Article 24 of GATT allows for the exceptional establishment of preferential regional trade initiatives, granted that they meet the following criteria: firstly, double WTO members should be notified of the details; secondly, duties and other trade barriers should be reduced or removed substantially on all sectors of trade in the group; and thirdly, barriers of trade to non-signatories should not be higher than they were previously. Regional trade agreements are not uniform. The coverage and depth of preferential treatment varies from one agreement to the other. One may involve only a few products or sectors, while the other may extend well beyond traditional tariffs to areas such as intellectual property and standards. In fact, a number of RTAs currently being negotiated seem to be anticipating an evolution of the multi-lateral trading system by seeking to cover subjects that have thus far been excluded from or not sufficiently discussed at a multilateral level, such as government procurement, child labour and human rights. In recent years RTAs have developed into a more complex configuration and there is a growing number of overlapping RTA networks that span across continents at regional and sub-regional level. Being a part of an RTA has its positive political benefits. On a most important level, RTAs have great strategic value and play a role in maintaining geopolitical balance in regions. RTAs are useful signals of a major power interest in the region, and maintaining strong economic and trade ties with all major powers may yet prove to be an effective means of maintaining regional stability. FTAs should be based on the rule of reciprocity. Having said that, one should bear in mind that trade facilitation and globalisation is highly influenced by the relative development of participating countries. Differences in negotiating skills, technology, financing and quality of infrastructure are just a few of the impediments to the successful conclusion of an agreement involving at least one developing country. Yet the developing world cannot be left out of multilateral trade liberalisation. Regional integration is the backbone of the European Union. The trade aspect has been an essential component of what has ultimately evolved into a comprehensive political union. It has further served to maintain the EU's external relations with third countries. The Presidency Conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 outline the basis of the EU's policy on FTAs. This was supplemented by the report to the European Council on the development of trade policy and the preferential agreements of the Community, which sets out the EU's objective of reflecting the nature of the relations with the partners concerned and a broader geopolitical environment. In the same document, the Commission goes on to state that the trade policy – particularly the FTA aspect – allows for the simultaneous development of a relevant regulatory framework in a more comprehensive manner than that currently allowed by the relevant multilateral framework and timeframe of the WTO. The EU is slowly moving away from the establishment of traditional FTAs with its main trading partners. It is seeking deep integration and looks for convergence on regulatory regimes. The European Parliament and the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy support this approach by the Commission. The Commission puts the multilateral approach first, which is also supported by the committee. However, despite strong economic relations, the EU does not have a single FTA in Asia. An FTA with an Asian country will anchor the presence of the EU in that region. Regional leaders in ASEAN have indicated that agreements such as that proposed by Singapore to the EU would not endanger regional relations. Rather, as long as the agreement offers scope for extension within the ASEAN region, it could boost momentum. From a strategical viewpoint, the commercial presence of the EU would also counterbalance the influence and dominance of China and the United States. I hope that in the vote tomorrow my colleagues will support an agreement with Singapore, which I hope we could sign in the near future. I know the Commission has some reservations on this. However, it has already signed an extensive political agreement with the ASEAN region. Therefore I am convinced that in the near future there will be a mutual understanding between at least the ITRE Committee, the Commission and hopefully Parliament in its vote tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner, what I actually would like to do is to address just a few points, as my colleagues have already had a lot to say. I believe that the difficulty we have, and that you in the Commission have in particular, is, in essence, the fact that you have to reconcile two different strategies. On the one hand, you have to implement reform in the European Union's agricultural production, and on the other, you have to improve developing countries' access to the market. That is of course extremely difficult, and is made more so by the very ambitious timetable, as you are required to be able to point to successes as soon as this year – successes in the Cancun negotiations. You must at least say in what direction you are taking us, and in doing so you also have to keep sight of your obligation to successfully conclude the negotiations in 2005. Add to that the complications with your trading partners, and the whole thing, taken together, amounts to a thoroughly tricky act. I have looked at many documents and position papers from Germany, but also from other countries, so that what is here on the desk in front of me is a pot-pourri. On the one hand, much that is said is complimentary; people approve of the fact that something is happening at last, and that we are going in the right direction. On the other hand, there are also many reservations and concerns, with fears that the European Union will end up with the model of what I might summarise in general terms as a sort of ‘leisure agriculture’, and that we are to some extent losing sight of the need to be flexible enough to be truly competitive and to be able to compete internationally. We may well be able to do a great deal for the environment and agriculture, but there is the risk of other instruments falling by the wayside. Commissioner, both you and Commissioner Fischler have, I believe, always said that we have enough room to manoeuvre. We have flexibility. We have to look at the details, perhaps at the milk prices for example, or in other areas, to see what else we might do. Let me conclude with a very brief question. At a seminar of the Group of the Party of European Socialists last week, representatives of the developing countries kept referring to the development box, and expressed the desire that more be done about it. Perhaps you could say something about this.

Mr President, Commissioner, there are a number of points I would very much like to deal with. Those of my colleagues who have spoken before me have covered quite a lot, so please permit me to focus on a few aspects. It was with interest that I read the Commission documents, as well as the various initiatives considered by the Council, which have had some influence on actual action plans. I find it particularly interesting that we are here attempting to define an area that is at present made up of various interests and also watched over and managed by different nationalities. To take one example, you were right to mention in the action plan the various meetings that you had with Canada and Russia. I think that what you are undertaking in those areas is of great interest. Like my colleagues, I would like to see Parliament more closely involved in this work. I believe that, in defining the area, which has its own specific problems, its own specific criteria and is undergoing changes of its own, you are attempting something that has real authenticity and which also involves political dimensions such as foreign or security policy. You have also, however, incorporated issues of health, research, infrastructure, energy and the information economy as a whole. The remarkable thing about this is that we really are taking account of the region's specific interests, and doing so not merely from the standpoint of our European interests or coupled with them, but by actually including the Russian dimension in the discussions and taking it into consideration, just as we do with Canada. I want to say how grateful I am for that, because it broadens to some degree the somewhat narrow view that we in Europe sometimes take, and which leads us to focus on purely European interests. Many thanks for that. What we ask is that you get Parliament more closely involved and attempt to find ways in which the parliaments and our counterparts in the various countries can support you in your work. After all, we have established very good cooperation in the European Economic Area in order to give support in the workings of government and administration, and we have seen this done in several other cooperative arrangements between parliaments. This sort of cooperation could actually be a source of strength to you, and I believe that you still need it. There is one thing I find lacking among all the interests and diverse topics that you address. Relevant though these are, either I have failed to spot it when reading or I have not managed to find the documents, but I find no reference to you focussing on the economic dimension of the area as a topic in its own right. It may be that I have overlooked this, and if that is the case, I crave your indulgence.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the United States' decision to distance itself from the International Criminal Court and its announcement last Sunday in the Security Council that it will henceforth only participate in UN missions if its military personnel are granted immunity reinforces the impression that, in some areas, the United States has adopted a more critical stance towards the institutionalisation of international politics than has the European Union. After the war, it was the United States which played a key role in the creation of a world order through the establishment of international institutions. Indeed, at that time, international justice was the watchword. Today, it is the United States which – through its withdrawal from international treaties – is challenging the acceptance of internationally valid rights and duties. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office, and indeed all of us, why this is the case. There is a reason for it, and I have a document in front of me, dated August 2000, entitled "The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2000: Implications for US cooperation with the ICC". Indeed, I wonder why we are holding this debate today. We set up an early warning system several years ago, but it does not appear to function. It would seem that regular talks are taking place, but the analytical methods appear to vary, we do not seem to be listening, we do not seem to be assessing each other's problems in time, and nor do we appear to be genuinely listening to each other. What is the problem, then? I would ask you all, especially the Council Presidency but also the Commission, to ensure that the early warning system functions in time. I think that the proposal put forward by Mrs Maes is excellent. We should indeed point out at forthcoming meetings with the Americans that we need better systems and make sure that they actually work in practice. What I am afraid of is not a transatlantic divide, which we have been discussing, but a transatlantic clash, and I am dubious about the much-vaunted common values which we are always talking about. I would urge you, Mr President-in-Office and Commissioner Byrne, to take this point very seriously.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission recommended on 12 March 2002 that the energy networks should be included in this amendment to the Regulation. What lies behind this is the proposal to amend the guidelines on the trans-European energy networks, on which Mr Beysen is the rapporteur in the Industry Committee. The Commission is proposing an increase in the maximum rate from 10% to 20%. Investments are to ensure a high degree of security in energy supply, which is to be accomplished by an increase in investment, which is meant to resolve the many and varied problems occurring in the planning and realisation of infrastructure development. The aim is to create a real internal market in energy, including those regions that are not at present included and covering strategies that have not yet been implemented. These include the candidate countries. The Committee agrees to the Regulation with, inter alia, a number of additions, which I will enumerate as follows. The investments envisaged should be made in projects that are necessary for the EU's economy and that are commercially profitable. Competition must not be distorted. The possibility of any increase in the Community funding allocated to energy networks in the Financial Perspective for 2002 to 2006 must be excluded, and the Commission is to produce a regular report for Parliament, detailing those projects whose completion can be expected to be speedy by reason of the increase from 10% to 20%. I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for his ability to take on board the Industry Committee's proposals with only slight variations. I would like especially to thank Mr Beysen, Mr Mombaur and Mr Turmes, who put a great deal of dedication into completing the report, sometimes by their amendments and suggestions. I would also like to thank the bureau and, most especially, the Commission.

 I have not voted for the compromise motion of Article 15(1) proposed by Mrs Paciotti and Mrs Palacio. The amendment to Article 15(1), which involves obliging the Member States to take steps to benefit national security among other things, is one that I regard as unbalanced. Where the mandatory storage of data is concerned, the rights of national legislators are insufficiently restricted and their duties are inadequately defined. The amendments made in Council mean that the Member States can require communications companies to systematically file all liable data from all users and make them available when authorised persons so request. These amendments neither specify important criteria, nor do they specify which data are to be stored, nor over what period of time, nor who is to bear the costs (themselves dependent on the quantity and time period involved) associated with the storage and processing of the data. This is left to the Member States. Moreover, it is not clearly set out what requirements, standards for liability and security measures are to apply to those enterprises to which the storage of data is entrusted. These issues are at present a matter within the third pillar. Information has come into my hands indicating that a framework decision on mandatory storage is at present in preparation. The topic is also being discussed with all the parties involved (among others, law enforcement agencies, communications companies, and persons involved in the protection of data) in the Cyber Crime Forum set up by the Commission.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for several years now there have been clear indications that the Republic of Korea has used subsidies in contravention of WTO rules to distort international competition in the shipbuilding sector to a considerable extent and with lasting effects. In June 2001 the Commission declared that its negotiations with South Korea had failed and recommended to the Council and Parliament to launch a WTO procedure to be accompanied by time-limited protection measures in favour of Europe's shipbuilding sector, which is in great danger. Parliament voted in favour of this procedure and also recommended including gas tankers in these protection measures. A study by the Commission is now available on the competitive position for various types of shipbuilding and in particular gas tankers. This study has now been transmitted to the Council. I have several questions for the Commissioner regarding this brief summary of the position. Firstly, when will the study be made available to Parliament and to the public? Secondly, does the study confirm the need to launch a WTO procedure against South Korea? Thirdly, are there differences of opinion about the study within the Commission? Fourthly, when will the Commission launch the WTO procedure, and will it continue to provide for the introduction of protection measures for sectors which have suffered damage? My fifth question is how many jobs have been put at risk in Europe because of this distortion in competition. Sixth, how many jobs have already been lost because no WTO measures have been introduced over the last two years and no accompanying protection measures have been taken? My seventh question is how many orders the European shipbuilding industry has lost over the last two years. My final question, Commissioner, is how you regard the situation and the discussions held by the Council on this subject. Mrs Riis-Jørgensen is here with us and the situation in the Council seems to be similar to that in Parliament. There are great controversies raging in the Member States as to whether the Commission has come up with an appropriate procedure, as on the one hand it is proposing to launch a WTO procedure and on the other it is intending to offset this with protection measures. The overwhelming majority of this House considered, when we voted on the Riis-Jørgensen report, that this was the right approach. I assume that there will continue to be an overwhelming majority for this in future, but I still wish to ask the Commissioner to give us some information on what measures he proposes, and to explain this to the Council as part of the new discussions now that the study has been transmitted to the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, my colleague's closing comments make an excellent introduction to my intervention. It is true, we need more strategic thinking and vision. This is a very, very difficult situation to deal with. Only if we try and put transatlantic relations on a new footing and make the quantum leap to strategic thinking will there be any permanent rapprochement between us in the long term. I have focussed, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Relations, Research and Energy, on investigating the economic implications. I came to the following conclusion, which my fellow Members supported and which I should like to thank James Elles for including in his report. Basically, we started from the premise that the transatlantic market already exists; you can see that for yourselves in several sectors. However, this has consequences because politicians and the public barely even notice this. We basically start from the premise that we are competitors. We are, however, also well aware of the fact that there is a closeness between us and that we are partners. But this very often finds relatively little expression in political action. So we need to take more note of economic realities and translate them into political thinking. That should also give us food for thought for strategic planning. The consequences are considerable. We have found evidence of increasingly frequent frustration between us and of alienation setting in. We have found evidence of segregation and of harping back to national policies – mainly on the American side but, to be fair, we are not completely innocent of this – and an upswing in so-called American and European values. This leads to more and more trade disputes, which feed on these problems. The question is: what can we do? As James Elles rightly says, we need to update the new transatlantic agenda and transatlantic economic partnership. How can we do that? I think we need a radical paradigm shift. We need to move away from mutual observation. We can achieve this paradigm shift in three ways: first, through a sectoral analysis of economic interdependence, secondly, by strengthening bilateral methods upstream of the WTO dispute settlement procedure and early warning system and, thirdly, through greater rapprochement. The Commission already set this out at the summit in the form of a positive agenda which the Council confirmed. And we shall welcome it on Parliament's part. I do not intend to go into any further detail right now. The details are there in the report and I trust that the Commission and the Council will support it.

 Madam President, thank you for your kind words. I know that my colleague Mrs Hoff would like to address a few words to you herself at the end of the speech which I am going to read out on her behalf, but I will thank you at the start. Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the accession of Poland and Lithuania will make Kaliningrad not only a Russian enclave, but also an enclave of the European Union. This problematic, unique and positively paradoxical situation results from the fact that Kaliningrad, being Russian territory, falls within the scope of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Moscow, but is in fact rather more affected by European Union enlargement. Attention was drawn to Kaliningrad's precarious situation as long ago as 1994, in a report by Parliament which described the future of the Kaliningrad region as a matter of immediate and pressing importance for Russia, for the states bordering on the region, and, equally, for the European Union. The practical response was, even then, to decide on measures which have become, in the meantime, even more relevant to the area's growth prospects. One can take as examples of this the encouragement of cross-border cooperation as well as the increased integration of the Kaliningrad area into European transport and telecommunications structures. It is to be regretted that adequate use has not been made of the time that has elapsed since then. Now, in the context of the strategic partnership which we are aiming at and of which you have spoken, new possibilities are taking shape, involving the neighbouring Poland and Lithuania, for finding solutions to Kaliningrad's situation, solutions that will ensure the area's viability and perhaps even enable it to play an active part in joining the partners together. At the same time, I would like to echo what was said as long ago as 1994 by emphasising that any consideration of Kaliningrad's future development must start from the premise that the area will continue to belong to Russia under international law and that its legal status will be determined solely by those competent to do so in Moscow and in Kaliningrad itself. There are two possible scenarios, one negative and the other positive. A negative scenario would see the European Union's relationship with Russia under great strain, with both sides having failed an important test of their ability to cooperate and prevent crises in accordance with the partnership agreement. In the positive scenario, however, Kaliningrad could take on the overall role of a centre of economic activity and as a point of reference for transport links, commercial activity and modern services in a dynamic Baltic region. The area could, by piloting the implementation of economic structural reforms, influence the whole of north-western Russia and bind this cross-border region more closely with Europe. An amicable settlement on Kaliningrad could, in short, be a model for how the partnership between the EU and Russia might become practical rather than existing in name only. New flexibility is, in the meantime manifesting itself on both sides as the acute need for action becomes apparent. I welcome President Prodi's recent reference to the need to make arrangements for Kaliningrad even before Poland and Lithuania join the EU, the Commission having elaborated some ideas on the subject in its 2001 communication on Kaliningrad. What is also positive is President Putin's evident commitment to a constructive negotiated solution. I do not propose, in what follows, to go in to detail into the various areas which we need to sort out together, but I would like to make just a few basic observations. People are understandably touchy about the issue of visas and border controls, and here a balance needs to be achieved between tight controls on the EU's external borders on the one hand, and the need for easier passage across the border on the other. Russia will also have to face up to the need for fundamental acceptance of the rules applicable under Community law, and we are working on the assumption that it will accept them. On this point, the EU cannot allow any exceptions to be made, as this would be to prejudge the cases of other border regions. For its part, the European Union should, at the same time, be considering what range of options there might be for a less onerous visa system within the Schengen boundaries, over and above the instances referred to in the communication. My report includes a number of proposals for a way ahead on this. The inclusive offer to partly integrate Kaliningrad into the Baltic area must be revived, but not by a border regime that excludes people. Flexible arrangements for the transport of people and goods may well be important preconditions for Kaliningrad's growth process, and they also have symbolic value in the eyes of people in the no-man's-land between containment and exclusion, but, despite what many in Moscow continue to believe, they are not enough to bring about growth on their own. We have seen that at the open borders of Poland and Lithuania. Kaliningrad's economic indicators are mainly negative and still show no definite upward tendency. The living standard in the border region is significantly inferior to that in Russia as a whole. One essential cause for the persistent downturn is certainly Kaliningrad's problematic geographical situation and its favourable treatment as regards taxes and customs duties, the whole of which has a natural tendency to facilitate criminal activity. Any opening up of Kaliningrad to the outside world must therefore be combined with profound economic and administrative reforms in the region. Without these, there is the danger that local industries, which are uncompetitive, will largely be cut out of the market by their foreign competitors and that foreign investors will be even less committed in Kaliningrad. It is, therefore, to the leaders in Moscow and Kaliningrad, who bear responsibility for the region, that we appeal for the creation on the ground of the conditions for good governance in the form of administrative, legal and political structures that work, are transparent, and can be relied upon. At the same time, there are many ways in which these efforts might be supported. In particular, it would make sense to set up an investment agency that could lay the financial foundations for this. This of course involves continued intensive cooperation within the TACIS framework and the willingness to make funds for this purpose available through the international financial institutions, among which I particularly mention the European Investment Bank. Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to conclude by handing over to my colleague Magdalena Hoff. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on what was said this morning. I believe that transatlantic relations are regularly subjected to crucial tests. What we are experiencing now is nothing new; it is not a new conflict. Steel is an old chestnut. As many Members have already indicated, we need to proceed with sufficient toughness. But we should also be guided by reason, wisdom and far-sightedness. The President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out that our relations are historical ones and that we have many values in common, but that we need to shift from a crisis situation to a process of dialogue. I would certainly support him in that. However, this also means that the Council needs to consider new initiatives. It was the Spanish Presidency that established the new transatlantic agenda. I believe that the Spanish Presidency should also undertake an analysis and a review and present new proposals at the next summit. I would like to ask what work you have done on this so far and what the nature of the Spanish Presidency's proposals will be. We need an update, as James Elles said this morning. We need an EU strategy that goes beyond what we have at present. The Commission proposal is good, but it does not go far enough, and it does not cover all factors. In particular, it does not include a sufficiently clear EU strategy. Commissioner Lamy said today that he is investigating several areas, including intellectual property and the auditing of accounts. In my own report, which I shall be presenting on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy together with James Elles for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall be presenting some proposals on this. In particular, you will be interested to see that economic relations are very close and that in many sectors it is already fair to talk about a transatlantic market. That does not of course mean that trade conflicts can just be glossed over, quite the opposite. A small delegation of us will be in Toledo on Monday, and the topic of relations between the USA and the WTO will be on the agenda. I would be grateful if you could briefly say something more about our approach at that meeting.

Madam President, congratulations on being seated there today. Thank you to the two Commissioners who are present and thank you also to the whole of the Commission's team. I would also like to thank the Council. I believe it was only by working together that we managed to achieve real success here. I include in this, by the way, our colleague Mr Westendorp, who headed our delegation and, unfortunately, is not here this evening, but I believe he deserves as much gratitude as everyone else. There are just a few points that I want to address. First, I believe that many Members have yet again forgotten a number of things, above all those whom I always describe as permanently engaging in mantra politics by repeating the same thing over and over again. I believe that they are forgetting that Doha opened a way ahead for negotiations and laid down a strategy for them. We should give more consideration to how we can work together with the Commission and the Council in future, for it is only now that the actual negotiations are happening. The subjects for discussion must be defined, and it is by no means certain that apparent successes we have achieved on many points will prove to be lasting successes over the years, and so I would like to ask the Commissioners in particular how they actually envisage cooperation with Parliament. I would like this cooperation to be substantially more precise and detailed, giving a much more accurate view of the state of negotiations you will be engaged in on the various subject areas, and also signalling where there are difficulties or problems, not only giving definite information on many points, but actually facilitating political monitoring as well. Let me make another point. I believe it will be much more important than in the past to join up policies on trade and foreign affairs. I would particularly like to mention in this context two regions – the European Union and the United States. I believe that the European Union and the United States bear to an incredible degree responsibility for the future definition of trade policy, which is much more than can be summed up in the traditional trade themes we were familiar with in the past, incorporating as it does so many new ones. Development of traditional trade policy and its connection with new subject matter will be the difficult task to be faced in the future. You – above all Commissioners Lamy and Fischer – managed to bring that off elegantly in Doha, but, as I said at the outset, the real work is only getting under way now. I believe we must attach much more emphasis to putting foreign policy regarding countries such as, for example, India, Singapore or China, but also regarding many of the Latin American countries, on a much firmer footing, using a stronger foreign policy to achieve greater understanding for what we actually want to achieve in the sphere of trade policy. There is still the prevalent feeling in certain countries and states that we are actually using our trade policy to engage in indirect protectionism. We should take care that this sentiment does not arise in the first place, and that, if it does, it can be rooted out. The Singaporean Ambassador has again drawn my attention to his country's long-standing desire to conclude a free trade agreement with the EU. I believe that bilateral free trade agreements bring with them the possibility of opening doors of that sort, and also have the potential to achieve greater multilateral rapprochement by means of bilateral negotiations. Commissioners, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us what you think about that.
Mann, Erika (PSE

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to touch on a few points in the short time I have available. Mr Daems, you quite rightly pointed out that you have achieved a great deal in the Council and you also referred to the flexibility on the part of the Council that this involved. You said that we have reached a good compromise. I agree, and I think that many of my colleagues in my group will see it the same way. It is an acceptable compromise. There are a good many points on which further negotiation is needed. Mr van Velzen hit the right note. We will have to carry on negotiating and fighting to achieve a common internal market, because this is just one step and further work will be needed. I believe that we in this House have one particular problem with this, and I have already heard a lot of people saying that it is difficult to have an informal trialogue as part of the second reading. That requires a great deal of work and needs a huge investment of time given all the linguistic difficulties involved. The whole package that we have before us is very complicated and needs a great deal of detailed work. I think that we here in Parliament – and I am addressing this comment more to Parliament than to the Commission and the Council, although it indirectly affects them too of course – will have to make a greater investment in ensuring that we have whatever support is required to tackle such a complex task from a political point of view. This will still not guarantee completion of the internal market. It is right that in future the Commission will have more power and scope for action. We have not used the word ‘veto’. That is probably very clever in political terms, but nevertheless it is something along those lines. Nevertheless, by means of cooperation and consultation, the national regulatory authorities have the power to ensure that they can take appropriate action to influence their national markets. There is an interesting definition of transnational markets. Nevertheless, there are two further problems to which previous speakers have referred regarding the interoperability of standards. I believe that the proposal does not go far enough in this respect. I cannot understand our countries, why they are not in favour of interoperability in the area of standards. I hope that something more will emerge in this field. There is also still a great deal more to be achieved, via consultation with Parliament, as regards Parliament's participation concerning technical measures, and that includes, in particular, Mrs Niebler's report, for which I am shadow rapporteur. I would simply venture to point out that Mr von Wogau will, I hope, be bringing forward an interesting report next year dealing more fully with the issue of Parliament's participation in such consultation processes. Once more, we have until Wednesday to consider things further, and the Council and the Commission have a further opportunity to comment on these points. I would be delighted if they would do that today.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I will just say a few additional words, which perhaps have more to do with practicalities and less to do with the substance. Firstly, I should like to compliment Commissioner Lamy most particularly on the superb cooperation which we are enjoying and – I think that I speak for everyone – on the excellent manner in which he is representing the European Union in the run-up to this forthcoming trade round. His task will certainly be a difficult one. The right balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, representing European interests and, on the other, ensuring that the other countries, our negotiating partners, and in particular the developing countries, are brought on board. Personally, I believe that this round will, more than any other, be able to send out a message to the world that it is possible to reconcile trade and politics. I trust, Commissioner Lamy, that you are in a position to achieve this, working together with your colleague Bob Zoelleck, but also with the many other negotiating partners that you have. It will not be an easy task. However, everything bodes well. I am grateful to you for consistently encouraging Parliament to play a more significant role in trade policy. Regrettably the Council has not taken the same step. Like you, I hope that we will be able to achieve more in this respect in the future. Incidentally, I should also like to thank all those colleagues in this House who have always supported this policy. I should, moreover, like to remind you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you also have a task to carry out in Doha, namely organising the meeting with all of the trade ministers. We have a good tradition of arranging for the European Parliament's delegation to meet the ministers attending the trade round. I would earnestly request that you organise this meeting again this time and also ensure that we have a debate and that it is not just an occasion for a chat or seen as a bit of an afterthought, as the Council is wont to do, but that it really is an occasion for serious dialogue. In addition, I should also like to inform you very briefly – my colleague, Konrad Schwaiger, mentioned this – that the parliaments will also have a joint meeting in Doha. The invitation will be extended jointly by the President of this House and the President of the IPU. I hope that we will make progress there. Here, too, we need your support, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. We have always had this support from the Commission. Thank you once again for cooperating with us.
Mann, Erika (PSE

Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for the work which he has carried out. Of course we welcome China and Taiwan, because I think we should be pleased, as the previous speaker said, that China and Taiwan are joining. A whole host of reforms is being initiated, as the Commission has rightly pointed out. For the rest, China will take up a key position within the WTO and this will also bring about considerable changes for the West. I am fairly certain that this will present the Commission with further challenges. For the rest, we are supporting the accession of China with considerable funds and I think we should do more here. For the first time, Parliament has been consulted. This is a result of excellent collaboration with the Commission and, of course, with the Council. But I have one thing to say to Mr Gahrton: it is true that accession to the WTO is not without its opponents in China. But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without, at the same time, trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China's capabilities considerably. I rather think that the doomsday scenario which you have conjured up in your report is highly exaggerated. I would like to see you evaluate matters in a somewhat fairer and more balanced manner in the future.
Mann, Erika (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to thank all three institutions. Although Mrs Niebler is not an institution, she has behaved almost like one! I would like to thank her sincerely for her report. But I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council. I would like to thank the Council, because it has changed its position in a way that would have been unthinkable until recently, as I am sure the Commission will agree. However, thanks are also due to the Commission because it has shown such persistence in pursuing this subject over the years, although we did not expect that it would act so quickly. Nevertheless, I have to tell the Commission that to some extent it has been unnecessarily tough, not least regarding the amendments put forward by Parliament, and that it has not perhaps shown the institutional flexibility that it might have or that might have been expected from the Commission. Mrs Niebler has quite rightly pointed out that there is a considerable difference between technical measures and strategic decisions on policy, and that when it comes to strategic decisions the European Parliament really ought to play a greater role than provided for in the report, so that transparency is guaranteed and democratic structures are actually established. This is even more important if you bear in mind that the Council is by no means in agreement with the Commission that the Senior Official Group should be established. That only leaves us with the Senior Official Committee, which means that the institutional framework for taking democratic decisions will be distinctly limited. I personally would therefore support Mrs Niebler's new proposal in which she suggests establishing a "call-back procedure" in the wake of Lamfalussy. My Group has, in any case, tabled certain amendments. I hope that the House will be able to accept these amendments. They will also be supplemented by an oral amendment which I hope the House will support. We can take on board the Council's proposal, in which it proposes that in cases going beyond technical measures the Commission should propose a legal instrument to Parliament and the Council. I hope that we will have your support for this and I hope that the Commission will be able to live with this amendment.
Mann, Erika (PSE
).  
– (DE) 
Mr President, I should like to say a few introductrory words and then perhaps go on to explain our oral question. We have tabled an oral question on behalf of our group. The main reason for this is our group’s criticism of the way in which the Council used the procedure laid down in Article 133 as the basis for its decision to apply for the appointment of a panel to examine whether section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act is incompatible with the TRIPS Agreement. We did not deal to any great extent with the substance of the Council’s case, although the substantive argument did meet with some opposition and engendered lively discussion in committee; we chiefly focused on the expression of our desire to be fully informed in future and to be included in the decision-making structures used by the Council and the special committee established under Article 133. We believe this is especially necessary in the realm of trade policy. As all of you here – honourable Members, Commissioner and representative of the Council – are aware, when it comes to trade issues, we in Parliament are only involved to a limited extent. For many years we have been crossing swords on this issue – mainly with the Council and only to a lesser degree with the Commission. In the case in question, it is a matter of initiating proceedings to examine whether, in a dispute between Pernod/Ricard and Bacardi, a primarily Euro-Cuban holding and a primarily U.S.-European corporation, the EU is entitled to lend support as it sees fit. The Council has come down clearly on the side of Pernod/Ricard in this dispute, and the Commission supports this position too. We in the committee did not pronounce ourselves on this dispute. All we said is that we should have wished to be informed before the institution of proceedings and before the appointment of the panel, so that we as a Parliament could have adopted a substantiated and well-founded position on the decision taken by the Council and the Commission. Let me add that the Commission, especially Commissioner Lamy, has kept us regularly briefed. Accordingly, none of our criticism in this case has been directed at the Commission. Perhaps the main point, and the reason why we attach so much importance to this issue, is that section 211 of the Trademark Act is one of those cases that relates to our long-running dispute with the United States over the Helms-Burton Act. It is about the extraterritorial application of domestic legislation. To that extent, we support the action taken by the Commission and the Council from a political point of view, but – as I have already mentioned – we do not condone the inadequate briefing of Parliament and its competent committee. Why is this so important? You will have noticed that legislators on both sides of the Atlantic have been coming under increasing pressure to support the decisions of their respective governments. It is very, very important to us to make it clear to the other institutions that they will only be able to secure our support in future if they provide Parliament and the responsible parliamentary committee with comprehensive information. You will see how necessary this is from the letter written by many Members of this House – I believe there were more than a hundred of us – and addressed to both the U.S. Government and the Council. The letter not only criticised the procedure adopted by the Council but also the substance of its decision. That is why I wish to make this urgent appeal to the Council to do everything possible in future to keep Parliament fully informed and to extend this obligation to cover any application for the institution of dispute-settlement proceedings, which means coming to the committee or the plenary chamber on such occasions and briefing Parliament in order to establish total transparency.
Mann, Erika (PSE

Mr President, may I pick up on a point that Konrad Schwaiger has just made. I too believe – and I am speaking here on behalf of my group – that there is a need to redefine the obligations of the Council in terms of its accountability. We all know, of course, that the Council acted correctly in the purely formal sense – this was the honourable Member’s line of argument too – and that the Council is not under any formal obligation to consult Parliament. However, I do not believe we are talking about formal procedures here, but rather about proper substantive political cooperation. As far as proper cooperation is concerned, the Council is still falling far short of its duty to Parliament. My wish for the future is that the Council, instead of constantly invoking the formal position, will find an interinstitutional procedure that enables us to engage in some decent cooperation in future in the field of trade policy. What you have seen this time will be seen more often in the future. But let us not be under any illusions: trade policy is becoming an ever wider field, and many issues go beyond trade policy and into the domain of international politics. These numerous trade disputes with the United States are a prime example. If you want Parliament to stand by you – and Parliament is with the Commission on the substantive issue, as Konrad Schwaiger said – you must ensure that we can cooperate properly on matters of substance. You must look on us as an adult partner, even if the Treaty does not yet formally recognise our adulthood. I believe that the institutions have always found ways and means of cooperating in the past. I wish the Council would do likewise and find a new procedure. It may be that a discussion or briefing session would be held after each meeting of the special committee referred to in Article 133(3). Or, if the Council initiates official procedures, it could come to the parliamentary committee and explain the situation. I believe these would be ways of cooperating, and they would remove much of what I believe to be utterly unnecessary bitterness from the present debate. We largely agree on the substance of this issue. I also hope that many of the honourable Members who signed the letter have come to see that this was not the right course of action. May I therefore urge the Council most earnestly to venture forward, perhaps even today, and make the case for a new form of cooperation.
Mann, Erika (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, I am grateful for the fact that we are having this debate, but I should just like to make two points. I am in the same boat as my fellow Members, in that I was only informed of one of the meetings to which the Council presidency invited us. We were, of course, delighted to receive the invitation. But it was indeed a cocktail party on Thursday afternoon, with all the attendant difficulties. When I arrived, the door was already closed. There was something I had to discuss beforehand and could not make it for the start of the gathering. It would be very good of you, Mr Danielsson, to make a proposal next time for a better arrangement that would enable all of us to be present. As for the second meeting you mentioned, I should be grateful if you would remind us which meeting that was. I know nothing about any other meeting. Konrad Schwaiger did not refer to it, presumably because he knows nothing about it either. Would you perhaps be so kind as to tell us which meeting it was that you invited our committee to attend? There is another point on which I am at one with my fellow Members, and I know that this is not a question but a brief comment: I wish you would truly regard this Parliament as a heavyweight in the political ring and treat it accordingly. We fully understand that we do not yet have the means or the right to demand such treatment, but I believe you can regard us from a political point of view as an equal partner.
Mann, Erika (PSE

Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Harbour for his excellent report. I am not just flattering him, I really mean it. My congratulations on his report which contains both a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission initiatives and many of his own suggestions. I should also like to thank him for his open-minded attitude to our positions, suggestions and proposed amendments. Similar thanks go to the Commission, which really has proven over recent years that it is able to start its own European initiatives in an extremely important sector and implement them internationally. We have to deal here with opponents – perhaps I should say partners at international level rather than opponents – who are very very strong in this sector, especially the United States. It is becoming more and more important for us to come up with our own ideas on what future prospects we want to give the Internet sector as a whole. So heartfelt thanks to the Commission – and the Council – on their innovation-friendly approach to this sector. I should like to pick up on a few points addressed by Malcolm Harbour. This initiative is concerned primarily with what should happen in the area of future research on the Internet. I think it is important here to progress beyond the Commission’s previous initiatives and anticipate the future. Malcolm Harbour mentioned this. What does that mean, anticipating the future in the Internet sector? It is tough terrain because forecasts are hard to make in both this and many other sectors. Here, however, we are dealing with a sector which is moving very very fast, which is regulated but where it is increasingly important that we look ahead and decide what standards will be needed in the future. The other question which keeps cropping up is exactly how this sector is perceived and understood by the people, by consumers as a whole. It is becoming more and more important here to create real confidence, so that we do not just have the technology, which is fantastic, we do not just have clever and intelligent regulation, we do not just have standards which anticipate the future, we also have people and consumers who are ready and willing to invest in this sector, not just by making telephone calls, but by using it in future to conduct their transactions. We shall need to invest much much more in this sector than we have done in the past. If we are to create real confidence, I should like to call on the Commission to do more here. To close, my request, my plea to the Commission is this: please bundle all the initiatives which you have started in the Internet sector into a single, cross-sectoral initiative with a real, overall, conclusive concept.

Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to make three points which could be of interest in the context of Konrad Schwaiger's report. Firstly, as you will see from the additional amendments which have now been proposed for this week, there is a great deal of interest in this issue within the House, and this interest generally tends to focus on a small number of themes. So my first question is this: are the TRIPs negotiations really all that promising? Should they continue as before, or is it time for a review? Should more be done in the field of agriculture? How can effective consumer protection be safeguarded? There are many other questions as well. I would also like to ask you about the Built-In Agenda, which is now being negotiated and which is due for review in March. How great, in reality, are the differences between the parties negotiating on the Built-In Agenda? What impact is the agricultural crisis in Europe having on these negotiations, and how far have the negotiations progressed overall? Or is it more a question of business as usual? Are we simply carrying on as if nothing has happened? The second point which I should like to raise is this, you have produced a document which indicates that you would like to see greater flexibility in the forthcoming WTO negotiations. Flexibility is a very broad term. I greatly welcomed this document but I am sure that it will spark off many political discussions in this House as well. You can interpret it in any number of ways, so let me put a few questions to you. Does this document signal a move away from the European Union's previous strategy, which, until now, has been based on the principle that we have always had, and wanted to have, a comprehensive role, which has included competition and investment, for example, but also all the ‘soft’ issues such as social standards, labour standards, and progress on environmental issues? Does this document signal a move away from that? Does it mean that you will need a new negotiating mandate or is the old one enough? What impact will this have on cooperation with the European Parliament? In this context, I am most grateful to Mr Clegg for pointing out, yet again, that Article 133 is not acceptable to us in its current form. This is nothing new to you, and we are on the same side here, but the Council is listening, and perhaps the Council will be prepared, one day, to introduce an amendment with us. The third point I would like to make is as follows: you met Mr Bob Soellig in the United States. I gather from the press that the mood of the meeting was very good, which is not surprising given that you are old friends, so in that sense I hope we can look forward to a rosier future in transatlantic relations. What are your specific expectations, however, of these good relations with regard to the fresh negotiations taking place within the WTO framework? Will there be positive signals, and will these positive signals mean that in June or July we will have a negotiating strategy which will take us to Qatar? And will this negotiating strategy include the developing countries as well?
Mann, Erika (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I too should like to thank my fellow Members for their reports and the Commission. I think that this form of cooperation has brought about a good compromise which may not, of course, be supported on all points by the whole House but which has demonstrated nonetheless that we are often able, through productive debate, to bring about a result which, on several counts, has real potential for development over and above the Commission's concept. The crucial question throughout has been whether or not to support Mrs Niebler's amendment – my fellow Member, Mr van Velzen, is engaged in conversation just now, but he addressed this point and pleaded in favour of it. I too am in favour of our supporting it, addressing as it does the crucial question of how harmonisation is to be organised at European level. The Commission has rightly pointed out that we need more harmonisation in this sector and more uniform structures. Of that there can be no question; we have been discussing this point for years. I have in the past always been a fanatical advocate of a single European regulatory authority but this idea is now dead and buried. We opted for a different variant and I think that numerous regulatory authorities have demonstrated that they are independent, self-sufficient and autonomous and that the state too is more than capable of developing excellent competition models here. Of course, there are other models which fall short of our expectations at European level, of that there can be no doubt, and something needs to be done here. The crucial question is how to configure the relationship between the European and national levels and here I would have preferred a lighter model, either along the lines suggested by me and my fellow Member, Norbert Glante, or along the lines of Mrs Niebler's model. Which is why I shall call for a vote in favour of Mrs Niebler's amendment tomorrow. Once again, we must pause for thought and I am most grateful to Malcolm Harbour and Nicholas Clegg, who have pointed out that they have been wondering in the meantime if the variations which they supported were the right ones and I think that is most intelligent of them. We have enough time to consider this between now and the second reading; perhaps we shall have found a common approach by then.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and Members of the Commission, at this late hour, I would like to use the speaking time available to me to give you a brief introduction to the Commission proposal for a Council regulation concerning the implementation of projects promoting cooperation and commercial relations between the EU and the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia, together with my report on it. Apart from the rather misleading formulation of the title, which mentions the industrialised countries and which does not of course include all the industrialised countries in the world, but only those with which we do not have any free-trade areas, cooperation or partnership agreements, I would expressly like to thank the Commission for its proposal for a regulation. As I see it, this is not the only area where it has done some splendid work, bearing in mind all the difficult political debates on this issue that have taken place in the Council, and also the cooperation with the European Parliament, which has perhaps not always been easy, no, it has done something else rather wonderful in that is has actually brought the many and varied, small-scale existing projects and programmes to be found in the aforementioned countries together in a single budget line, thereby creating a legal basis as well. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a heartfelt thank you to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have had. The Commission proposal for a Council regulation under consideration seeks to create a solid legal and budgetary framework to underpin actions taken under the various bilateral agreements signed between the EU and the six industrialised countries mentioned. These actions are currently financed from a number of different budget lines and some have to be undertaken as pilot schemes or preparatory actions due to the absence of a legal basis for the budget lines in question. In producing this proposal for a regulation, the Commission has now created a legal basis. In drafting the proposal, the Commission aimed to ensure that Member States retain the primary responsibility for export promotion. Community action is thus restricted to measures that complement the endeavours of the Member States and other EU public bodies, and – as we always put it so nicely – thereby create European added value. The proposal provides for regular reports to be made in future to the European Parliament and the Council. We have amended it slightly in several places and we have also inserted the stipulation that the regulation is to expire at the end of December 2005. In addition, I have tabled an amendment which I hope the Commission and Council will support, requesting the Commission to submit a new proposal as early as the year 2003, in which it might like to outline the overall framework for a new trade policy and philosophy. This would also solve the dilemma that we are still facing, namely the fact that we have no positive definition of trade policy whatsoever in our Treaty. Instead we only define it in a negative way by excluding what it does not cover. I would be grateful if the Commission could use this positive definition in future. I believe the post-Nice Process lends itself extremely well to this, and in this connection I would also ask the Commission to always keep in mind that Parliament is not happy with the current wording of Article 133. This should come as no surprise to you, Commissioner Patten, rather I assume that, naturally, you are familiar with Parliament’s view of the matter. Incidentally, I would also be grateful if you would include your position in this new wording, i.e. your position in relation to one of the countries, namely the United States, which you have now set out – indeed you have provided a very comprehensive overview of our relations with the United States. I would also like the ruminations that are currently taking place within the Commission, especially on the part of Commissioner Lamy – who would like a policy statement to be produced in the sphere of trade policy at some stage – to be included in a review in the year 2003. The projects, which are now to be financed in concrete terms under this budget line, encompass cooperation projects, business-related training programmes and programmes for promoting trade relations. These include the above-mentioned programmes concerning the United States, and especially those set up with Japan. On a final note, I would like to say another big thank you for all the experimental projects you have tested out in relation to the various countries. It would be beneficial if you could draw conclusions from this, and summarise what you think could be passed on to programmes with other countries, what, in your opinion, may not have proved as successful or what you think does not stand a chance of surviving the post-2005 period. If you carry out this review, then as I see it, we will have an excellent foundation on which to base a real trade policy and philosophy. In the light of globalisation and the next world trade round, you will then have established an excellent basis to my mind. Once again, I would like to thank you warmly for this.

Mr President, Commissioner Patten, I believe you have given us a good introduction and briefing on the issues and topics that we shall be discussing, and I believe the honourable Member, Mr Elles, was right to emphasise the need to establish precisely what we wish our transatlantic relationship to achieve in the year 2001 and beyond. The most important thing for us will be to consolidate, to examine very carefully the actual progress that has been made in the various programmes we have launched under the umbrella of the Transatlantic Agenda. These are the topics referred to by Mr Elles. But there is another area which is very important and which has come in for a great deal of criticism, namely the mutual-recognition agreements, which have given rise to very many problems on both sides of the Atlantic, especially the American side. I should be grateful if you would deal in detail with these agreements in the communication which is scheduled for the spring of next year and if, besides the analysis requested by the other side of the House, you would also make proposals as to how we can achieve new aims in future in all domains – in the various dialogues, in our cooperation in the fields of foreign policy and security policy and even in practical everyday areas such as the mutual-recognition agreements. That will be very, very important. Another area relates to the aforementioned EU educational centres, which I believe have been highly successful. Consolidation is important, but so, too, is the right perspective. I believe you touched on an important point there. Under the Clinton Administration, we have made great strides in the realm of political cooperation. However, we have also seen trade policy, and trade disputes in particular, playing an ever greater role as a determinant of general political relations and gaining absolutely unmerited prominence, in my opinion. It is essential that, at future summit meetings, you actually manage to focus attention on the major political issues and that matters such as the trade disputes which highlight differences between us are assigned to their proper place, that their importance is not exaggerated and that they are not allowed to become focal points of political discord between Europe and the United States. So it will be important to change tack here and write a real Transatlantic Agenda for the year 2001. I know that our Ambassador in Washington, Gunter Burghardt, has already spoken about this, and I should be delighted if his interesting proposals were actually incorporated into your communication. I wish you every success in this task. I also wish our Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, every success in his efforts to bring about the settlement of our trade disputes with the United States, and it would please me to see you present the communication at the earliest possible date.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow members have already picked up on the main points. Permit me, therefore, to address just a few aspects. The European Union has achieved a number of successes, mainly thanks to Commissioner Lamy, who really has achieved some resounding successes. But this also applies of course to the United States, and the same will apply to the other countries due to enter into negotiations. In my view, one important point will be not just be to help China integrate into the world economy – it has already more or less done that – but also to help this country take a further step towards the general democratisation of its society. We have been able to follow what is at stake in all the discussions, in the leading world press and in the lively debate between economists on the matter, but the crucial question is: what will actually happen once China becomes a member of the WTO? Will it mark the beginning of a further opening of society? Will it mark the beginning of a new round in politics? Will it result in institutional reforms in China? And, of course, will there also be a further opening of the market? These are the really crucial and exciting questions which we face. I am sure that it is in the minds of all the honourable members who have spoken and I believe that it is my group’s opinion, that we should use this opening and the integration of China into the World Trade Organisation to help it make a quantum leap. However, we must not fool ourselves, we must not harbour any illusions, and we must insist that the WTO rules are in fact upheld, because this is, of course, the crux of the matter. This is where we really will have to get down to brass tacks during further discussions with the Commission. Because the package negotiated is extremely comprehensive and includes highly critical and sensitive sectors. Critical voices are already being heard on the part of industry to the effect that success is all well and good, but ex-post control of implementation is equally important. I think that we will be able to count on good collaboration here, so that this form of implementation can be monitored by Parliament and Parliament can be kept abreast of current developments. One further point which I should like to address, and which I think is highly important, is our hope that with the opening of the market and with the further opening of society in China, greater respect will be given to human rights. Human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society. I think that this a point which we cannot allow to be sidelined, even in talks, even if they do not form a substantial part of purely economic negotiations. I think that you have always set particular store by this. Nonetheless, it is important that this point be reiterated constantly.

 Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, you rightly referred to many points and I am grateful to my fellow Members for saying how indebted we are to you for the way in which you led the negotiations in Seattle. This was done with consummate elegance, and I must say that I was present at many press conferences and I also went to the events organised by the non-governmental organisations. You also explained the European Union's negotiating position and its strategy with the utmost clarity. I believe that you made it clear that the European Union is in a position not only to take on a leading role in this and the forthcoming world trade round – and that we do not come here as poker players to secure our own interests – but also that we are prepared to bring the other countries, in particular the developing and least developed countries, on board with us. This message has been heard, and I am proud to have been part of the delegation in Seattle. But we should not labour under any illusions. Two things have become apparent: one is that this accumulation of interests is something that we will continue to see in international negotiations in the future, and I should like to endorse the position of many leading economists who are saying that this was just the beginning. We will see that this conflict of national and regional interests will be even more pronounced in the future than it has been in the past. Here, of course, it will be important for us not to line up against each other in blocs – the European Union against the United States, the European Union/the United States against the developing countries, or perhaps also some of the developing countries against others – as we have seen in Seattle and also in other contexts. In the future, it will be much more important for us to adopt a more sophisticated approach with greater emphasis on preparation, so as to make it clear which interests we actually stand for together in these world trade rounds and why we need them: namely to bring globalisation under control, taming the rank growth which would otherwise proliferate without a world trade round, in order to implement a sound strategy to overcome global problems. The second phenomenon which we saw – and here too, I do not believe that we should have any illusions – was that the interest which civil society showed in the proceedings in Seattle was not only an interest in the world trade round, but also a demonstration against all those things which people do not like. This started with the healthcare system in the United States. I spoke to many people on the streets. The issues ranged from future Chinese participation in the world trade round to the policies pursued in Cuba, and there were many other issues besides. Increasingly, politicians are being asked to explain – and to do so in greater depth than they have in the past – what the World Trade Organisation actually does and why it exists. Of course, it also needs to be reformed and to be made more transparent, but it must also be explained better. Here I am particularly glad that parliamentarians have now been included; other speakers have referred to this. The role which will fall to us, as a parliamentary forum, in the world trade round will not be easy. However, I believe that this is the only way to introduce greater democracy into such a complex bureaucratic machine.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, don’t get so worked up! This is an essential point which is really important. From the voting point of view, Mrs Maes is quite right. Mr Chichester, I am surprised that you of all people wanted to have the point “socially-balanced” voted on separately. We voted for it by a large majority in the Committee. However, the only thing that I should really like to see is that the voting procedure runs properly. I would therefore ask you to grant Mrs Maes’ request.

Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on Monday the committee approved the report of Mr Schwaiger with a large majority and I must say how pleased I am with the overall way in which Mr Schwaiger has lead the debate. He has shown great openness which has, in turn, lead to us putting forward compromises which are not really compromises in the sense that they do not negate positions defended by individual groups; rather, we have genuinely fought and wrestled to find a European compromise, a European formulation which fully supports the position of the Council and of the Commission. This is what it is all about. I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for pointing out the overall difficulties which exist in opening this new negotiating round in Seattle. We ought to be realistic and not fool ourselves: it will not be easy, in Seattle and beyond, to steer the course which we plan and hope to follow in Europe, particularly where it goes against the interests of our negotiating partners. Nevertheless, I wish you, Commissioner Lamy, and all those who are involved, the best of luck. I can assure you that you have the support of my group. We will give you our unqualified support. However, the difficult opening also means, and we should not fool ourselves, that the old consensus which influenced the interplay between open world trade and binding trade rules and which always assumed that there was an essentially positive influence on national developments has since begun to crumble. Even in the rich countries, in particular the United States, which have profited most from open markets, the increasing number of international competitors within the framework of the World Trade Organisation has lead, ironically I might add, to growing scepticism and concern that globalisation is also bringing with it impoverishment, destruction of the environment and the loss of national sovereignty. And with the loss of foreign policy as a whole, the temptation is also growing to accept foreign economy as a replacement. The Socialist Group unreservedly supports the efforts of the Commission and the Council for a comprehensive negotiating round. Only this strategy can ensure that all the issues which have a European interest are truly given full consideration. Only in this way will it eventually become clear where the advantages and disadvantages for European states and European citizens lie. This is why we are also in favour of a single undertaking process. Nothing is decided until all the issues are on the table. It is also necessary for the Parliament to be fully informed and involved. This is particularly important because so many issues, especially new issues, as many of my colleagues have already mentioned, are of an extremely emotive nature, for example, the issues of how we can include investments in the scope of the world trade round, new rules on competition, social and working standards and much more. Parliament must be fully involved. The citizens and non-governmental organisations and companies of the European Union will follow negotiations in Seattle more intently than ever before and will focus their attention on the questions of whether world trade is generally becoming fairer, more socially-conscious and more well-balanced and whether it can take into account the interests of every party. The feelings against an untamed globalisation process, which are marked by a basic scepticism, will come to the fore during the negotiations. It is therefore necessary for us social democrats to make clear where the opportunities lie and where the globalisation process can have a more positive influence in the future. But we shouldn’t fool ourselves: less WTO does not automatically mean less globalisation. That is an illusion! It means less globalisation which can be influenced. In this respect, I would once again like to make it absolutely clear that the Commission and the Council have our support. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about some fundamental aspects of the Millennium Round which my party considers to be important. My colleagues will deal with this in greater detail from their own respective points of view. The new round of World Trade negotiations which will open in Seattle on 30 November, offers the opportunity to partially extend the blueprint for world trade, in some fundamental aspects. The round will automatically take on a symbolic character and should contain a clear message from the European Union. Our aim must be to achieve growth, employment and prosperity for everyone, and at the same time to reduce the poverty which exists throughout the world. The concept of opening up the market further only makes sense if everyone is able to profit from it. What we need is a new sense of direction, which leads to a reconciliation of trade and social components, without thereby setting up new barriers of discrimination by means of a concealed form of protectionism. We therefore have to ensure that social and employment standards, standards for health and food as well as env0ironmental considerations form an essential part of the negotiating package. The new WTO Round may lead to a further push towards globalisation which will make many people anxious. We must make it clear that everyone has something to gain from an open system of world trade. As far as this is concerned, it is particularly important to establish improved integration of the developing countries into the world economy and into the multilateral world trade system. The Group of the Party of European Socialists particularly supports the Commission’s attempt to combine the concepts of globalisation and sustainable development. This is the only way to ensure that the basis for world trade is formed in a balanced and socially just way. We also agree with the Commission and the Council, in that this round of negotiations must be comprehensive, that is, one that includes all subjects. This is the only way to guarantee a sensible consideration of the specific advantages and disadvantages. This is also the only way that the interests of the European Union and of its citizens can both be assured. This time, the European Union must show that it is in a position to play some role in these marathon negotiations, if not a leading one. It would be disastrous for the European side to respond passively to the current weakness of the American political leadership. This is an appeal particularly to the Council to come up with a united European position and to the Commission to express complete confidence that a comprehensive mandate for negotiation will be granted in time, which will allow it to be submitted officially to Parliament for approval at the same time. Only if the European Union is strong at the negotiating table, will it be able to ensure that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, there will be a better balance in the globalisation process, between the European and the American models for liberalisation.  Comprehensive information and transparency are necessary to win the public’s confidence in and agreement with the new negotiating rounds. We particularly welcome the consultation with unions and non-governmental organisations. Confidence is also essential because the continuing development of the European Model amongst other things depends on what scope for arrangements national and regional administrations will have in the future. Just consider that the World Trade Organisation is a leading player, if the leading player, in shaping global economic processes. Only by combining transparency, the involvement of the public and official, extensive means…  (The President cut the speaker off)

Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I am convinced that people have good reason to look forward to enlargement. It remains true, though, that they also harbour many fears, and we must take those fears seriously and allay them wherever we can. Regional policy is an important means of dispelling such fears. It can and must help to prevent or eliminate inequalities, injustices and anomalies within the EU. It must not, however, encourage or sow the seeds of new injustices. For this reason, we take a similar view to that expressed by the previous speaker, Mr Berend, in opposing any European regional policy that simply induces companies to relocate. People will not understand or support a Europe that rewards companies for shifting jobs from one region and then only providing the same number of jobs elsewhere because we are subsidising the relocation. Another point we have to bear in mind is that EU support funds must not be used to subsidise drastic tax cuts in recipient countries. Solidarity is a noble value, but it must be mutual, and some of us will quickly recognise that, by promoting tax dumping, we could well besawing off the branch on which we sit.

 Mr President, may I point out that it is pronounced Duin, as in Duisburg. I know that it can sometimes be problematic, but I will take the liberty of pointing it out at this stage. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the words of thanks voiced by previous speakers to the two rapporteurs. I believe that we have now taken another major step forward in this ongoing debate, thanks in particular to Mr Mastorakis's report. I should like to comment on the two reports together. It will be clear to the Commission too that there are several demands that Parliament repeatedly underlines – including in the report – and I assume that a consensus could be reached here on the following: that we do not want renationalisation; that 75% of GDP is a good yardstick and that 0.45% of GDP is a minimum if we are to be able to implement a viable European structural policy. I should now like to say something on the outstanding points, which are also mentioned in the reports. Many people believe that a new Objective 2, whatever it looked like, could solve their problems. We have to be more honest and cannot say to each region: you will also get in under Objective 2, once it is restructured in some way. That is why we wish to make various proposals, and these are also reflected in the reports. The first concerns the regions that will suffer from the statistical effect, the current Objective 1 regions. For these, we need to launch a new programme – let us call it a 1b programme – that is generously funded, but above all – this is very important to the regions and we must take it into account – that has a legal framework that is comparable to Article 87, and which will enable them to use the aid to meet their region's specific needs. The second concerns the disadvantaged regions, which take centre stage in Mr Pomés Ruiz's report. Here we do not need a new Objective 2, but a very special instrument for these regions, which properly takes into account the special problems that we of course wish to acknowledge. We should not try to lump everything together here. The third proposal is for a real Objective 2 for those areas undergoing structural change. Here I would, however, make a strong plea in favour of ensuring that in this case the Member States are given as much freedom as possible to use the funds as they see fit. This triad is important. It is conveyed clearly in the Mastorakis report as it stands, which is why we will of course be voting in favour of it. A few changes are probably needed to the Pomés Ruiz report to achieve this, and we hope that we will be adopting those today.

Mr President, I have a small oral amendment. The committee still addressed its demand to the Convention. We should change this to ‘Intergovernmental Conference’ in order to demonstrate that we are up to date.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this report, for which I would like to thank the rapporteur very sincerely, is a refinement of the Musotto report that we adopted at the beginning of the year. To be more precise, this report is about the direction Parliament wishes to go in. I am quite willing to admit that we have not totally achieved that, because there is still too much in this report, but I still think that it is a good one. All in all, I do not think the picture is as black as the rapporteur has painted it. In this report we have once again emphasised certain points that have already been identified, such as our rejection of any renationalisation of structural policy. We have also once again made it clear that regions currently benefiting from support will have to accept cuts; we do not want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes about this. However, we have also managed to clarify some points in this report. I disagree totally with the previous speaker on this, because I think it is very important for the Commission to make proposals at this stage about how it will move forward with Objective 2. People are waiting for a signal in Objective 2 regions too, and we cannot just concentrate on Objective 1 in our discussions. The same applies to Community initiatives. This is also an important area where we need to either clarify matters or at least identify a recognisable direction. How will the Community Action for Border Regions be continued? And how will action on cities move forward? And rural areas? I would like to stress two more points of great concern to me. One is that the programme must be scheduled to start so that funds are actually available on 1 January 2007, and, equally important, we need a more coherent approach, and in that regard we need to send a signal to the Commission that it should at long last achieve greater coherence between individual policy areas. My final point is this: I believe, and my group has also taken a decision to this effect, that for Objective 1 we should neither establish a fixed criterion nor a fixed percentage. We need to make a decision on the basis of concrete proposals, and the Commission is in the process of drawing something up.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it has been pointed out several times today already, and I can only emphasise it, that the advantages of EU eastward enlargement naturally outweigh the disadvantages and that many will gain from it. But there are also problems and we cannot disregard those problems if, as Mr Walter has just said, we want to take the citizens with us. That is particularly so at the interfaces of enlargement, that is the border regions. Many border regions are already marginal areas with large structural deficits. It is for that reason that we cannot leave those regions alone. That is why, among other things, we have Community action for border regions, which I consider to be a very good instrument. The main section relates to transport. As we also made clear in the Sommer report, we must give regional transport a central place in that. It is not enough only to invest in TENs, because it is not only about ways from Warsaw to Berlin or from Vienna to Prague, but it is also about ways from one small town over here to another small town over there. This brings me to the second key area mentioned in this Community action, namely support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Cross-border trade is a necessary step. There is now a pilot scheme that has at last got going and I hope it will be a great success. But we will only be successful if we simplify the application procedures and if we get better coordination between support instruments, for example between Interreg and PHARE-CBC. I also want to stress here that we do not need any new instruments, but that we should optimise the existing ones. Finally, we must also give some thought to whether we cannot increase the proportion of cofinancing in one corner or another. Instruments like Community Action really have European added value. In border regions, people come together. They may work on one side and live on the other. This is where they can get to know each other and learn from one another. That is why we should do all we can to assist this process.

Mr President, I wish to start by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done, which has enabled us to make out a good basis for the years to come. I would also like – and I think this might be permitted me – to say a word in praise of our own group, whose discussions, which were highly intensive and also sometimes rigorously conducted, produced uniform outcomes, something I consider to be very important in this area. I want to deal with those essentials that are of significance to us. The first point I wish to make, Commissioner, is that we join with you in rejecting the renationalisation of regional policy. That is for us of primary importance. Efforts are being made in certain Member States to reclaim this policy for the national level. We here are quite united in repudiating this. Cohesion policy makes clear European solidarity, which we do not want to lose, but rather to emphasise in the future. On this we, Parliament and Commission, stand shoulder to shoulder. My second point is that we seek greater coherence – between regional policy on the one hand and, in particular, the common agricultural policy on the other. We could perhaps engage in a dialogue, even with Commissioner Fischler, on how we might manage this, without which our goals for rural areas, and the agricultural policy's goals for rural areas, will not always be found in the same direction, and this is something we must work on. It is also beyond dispute that going below the 0.45% level imperils the cohesion objectives, so we just have to become more efficient, as has also been made abundantly clear by Mr Pohjamo's report, which we were discussing earlier. Now to my final point. We need to achieve a balance between the candidate countries and the regions we have supported to date. I think it is not at issue that we must make enormous efforts for the candidate countries, that there must also be a cohesion instrument to help them, and this was also mentioned in the interim report you presented last week. We must also, though, give thought to the need to continue to bring the regions we used to support up to the EU average. If we manage this balancing act, I believe we will gain Europe greater acceptance. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish to express my support for those who have said that this debate must not be about the safeguarding of possession, but about aid for those who need it most. I also want to say frankly that, in my considered opinion, nobody must close his eyes to the fact that enlargement is going to present us all with great challenges, those of a financial nature among them. The Germans learned their lesson through reunification, when the citizens were told at first that it would involve no fiscal burdens for them. This was demonstrably false. Let there be no misunderstandings – of course we want enlargement. But we must squarely face the consequences for structural policy. We should not simply be told ‘as you were’, and I do not believe that we will be. If we are not to forfeit the trust of people in the affected regions, we must point this out clearly, honestly and at an early stage. If there is not to be a rude awakening, we must explore the possibilities of full support for the candidate countries in building up their infrastructure and, at the same time, concern ourselves with continuing to bring the weakest regions of the Fifteen up to the average. The success of this will depend on making certain changes which would have been required even without enlargement. First, there is the fact that the cohesion countries can point to very variable results from the catching-up process, and it is evident that the greatest successes were achieved where the actors were on the spot and shared a commitment to maximising the efficiency of the support. Moreover, project evaluation needs further improvement and efficient management needs greater rewards than in the past if the effectiveness of the means employed is to be assessed. Last but not least, there is no getting away from the need for closer dovetailing with the other EU policies, in particular the common agricultural policy. I believe that both targets can be reached through the decentralisation and simplification that Mr Barnier has mentioned.

President. 
 – The next item is the resumption of the joint debate on the Commission statement on Eurostat and discharge for 2002.
President.  
 
Mr Kuhne, I agree with what you are saying, and so, although, as President, I am not supposed to do this, I have nonetheless – this being my last session in this House – added to your own some of the speaking time we have gained. Otherwise, though, you should keep to your speaking time.
President.  
 There are two comments I would like to make on this. For a start, Mr Bonde, I always allow something like an extra 10% speaking time. If someone has three minutes, that simply adds up to a bit more than is the case with the speaking time allotted to you. You have not been treated unfairly. Secondly, I would like to say, on a personal level, that I very much regret the fact that the star counsel for the European taxpayer, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, is absent from tonight's debate, at which there is work for him to do. I very much miss him. Further to the Commission's statement, I have received six motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
 Voting on the reports will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon. Voting on the motions relating to the statement on Eurostat will take place on Thursday. The debate is closed.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0271/2004
) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (COM(2004) 190
 – C5-0162/2004
 – 2004/0064(CNS)).
President.  
 Commissioner, I understand why you have spoken at such length. Indeed, our Rules of Procedure clearly state that you can speak for as long as you want. On the other hand, our Rules also state that the President should try to reach an agreement with the Commission about speaking time. With all due respect, may I ask you to be brief in summing up at the end of each debate this evening.
President.  
 Thank you, Mr Watson, for clarifying that; it helps the atmosphere in this House. The Commissioner has every right to demand that such things be sorted out. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0230/2004
) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the risks of violation, in the EU and especially in Italy, of freedom of expression and information (Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) The President has received a letter from Mr Ribeiro e Castro, expressing doubts as to whether this debate is permissible. I shall therefore give Mr Ribeiro e Castro the floor for two minutes in order that he may explain this.
President.  
 Under the Rules of Procedure, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, you ought only to have had one minute, but the two you were allotted you owe to my generosity. Speaking for two and a half minutes is not actually acceptable. Turning to the matter in hand, there is in the Rules of Procedure a provision according to which motions of this kind on non-admissibility have to be received 24 hours in advance. This deadline has not been met, and even if it had been, the President has, quite apart from any other consideration, ruled that the substance of your motion must be rejected, and I am of one mind with him on this. The debate will now proceed.
President.  
 Mr Tajani, you will be in the Minutes in any case by virtue of having spoken. I will, of course, also forward your request to the President, but that does not alter the fact that we are now proceeding with the debate.
President.  
 Mrs Angelilli, I think it is worth saying that there are no documented instances of any Member of this House, or of any observer, signing themselves in with a false signature. I owe it to the Members here present to say that.
President.  
 
I have said what has to be said on the subject, and in view of the lateness of the hour, I will allow no further debate.
President.  
 The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0229/2004
) by Mrs Angelilli on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down the requirement for the competent authorities of the Member States to stamp systematically the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross the external borders of the Member States and amending the convention implementing the Schengen agreement and the common manual to this end (COM(2003) 664
 – C5-0580/2003
 – 2003/0258(CNS)).
President.  
 The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. For the Minutes, I wish to record my thanks to Mr Podestà for standing in for me for a minute.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0248/2004
) by Mr Ceyhun on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction – (recast) (COM(2003) 808
 – C5-0060/2004
 – 2003/0311(CNS))
President.  
 The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(1)
 Mr Ceyhun was unfortunately right to say that it would be his turn after midnight. Whenever we were sitting at night, it was always my ambition to finish at 12 midnight precisely. We have not quite succeeded in that today. We have gone ten minutes over time, but I am very grateful to the Commissioner, who has played no small part in ensuring that it is no more than that. I ask the interpreters in their booths and the people behind the scenes for their indulgence for things going on for ten minutes more. We did make the effort! (The sitting was closed at 12.12 a.m.)
President.  
 The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments?
President.  
 That will be corrected.(1)

 Mr President, as I have to take the chair, I have swapped with Mr Simpson, who will be speaking later on behalf of our group. Since early last year, the Americans have been demanding the handing over of passengers’ data before they join a flight; some of this information is of a highly personal nature. The US authorities planned to store this data for fifty years, with it being used not only to combat terrorism and potential dangers associated with it, but also, potentially, being made available to other security agencies as well. The threat was made that, if the airlines did not comply, they would have to pay heavy fines or risk losing their landing rights. Not only in this House did this call forth vehement criticisms, one in particular being that this was illegal, in that it is in flagrant breach of two items of European legislation, namely the Data Protection Directive and the Regulation on the handling of data in flight booking. This, as the Commissioner has said, prompted the Commission to take action. Where are we now? The fifty years for which the data was to be stored have now become three and a half. We have managed to get limitations put on what is done with it. The data is to be used only in combating terrorism and crimes connected with it. The rules are to apply for three and a half years in the first instance, after which they are to be renegotiated, and not all the passenger information is to be handed over; the US authorities have, in particular, confirmed that the really personal and sensitive ‘special service information’ and that derived from the ‘special service request’ is to be deleted. Moreover, legal peace has been restored by the requirement for passengers’ prior consent, and the Commission will see to it that it is we who actively transmit the data – which means that we can also filter it – whereas, at present, it is still collected by the Americans; whilst this may well not, unfortunately, meet European data protection standards, it would be unfair to say that we had not achieved a great deal. I will end by pointing out to the Commissioner that I see the clause about expiry after three and a half years as being significant in the sense that there is always a tension between, on the one hand, the need to intervene in the private sphere and, on the other, the potential needs of internal security. If we are to consider extending this system beyond the three and a half years, it must, in that period, be demonstrated to produce real results.
President.  
 Mr Miller, although my initial suspicion is that all this has nothing to do with the agenda, I can quite understand your desire to see it in the Minutes, so that is where it now is.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0451/2003
) by Mrs Aaltonen on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on petition 842/2001 concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with Multiple Sclerosis, within the European Union (2003/2173 (INI)).

President. 
 – Mr Elles, I share your view about the presence of Members, but unfortunately the President cannot run Parliament like a regiment of soldiers.
President.  
 We now come to the decision on urgent procedure: Proposal for a Council Decision on additional macro-financial assistance to Serbia and Montenegro amending Decision 2002/882/EC providing financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2003) 506
 – C5-0428/2003
 – 2003/0190(CNS)] The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has already adopted a report by Mr Belder on this subject.
President.  
 Does anybody wish to speak against the urgent procedure?
President. 
  
Mr Turmes, could you please clarify this?
President.  
 We now come to the vote on the request for urgent procedure. (Parliament agreed to urgent procedure.)
President.  
 The next item is the joint debate on the following four recommendations for second reading: - A5-0327/2003
 by Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community’s railways [8011/3/2003 – C5-0295/2003
 – 2002/0025(COD)]; - A5-0325/2003
 by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (Railway Safety Directive) [8557/2/2003 – C5-0297/2003

 – 2002/0024(COD)].
President.  
 Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski. I wanted to comment briefly on your remark about transport policy being discussed in the morning for once. My reply comes from Part Two of Goethe’s Faust
: ‘Wer immer strebend sich bemüht, den können wir erlösen
’ (‘For he whose strivings never cease is ours for his redeeming’).
President.  
 Mr Sterckx on a point of order. To which of the Rules of Procedure does your point relate?
President.  
 I must inform you that personal statements may be made at the end of a debate rather than during it. Our Rules of Procedure are perfectly clear on that point.
President.  
 Mr Simpson, I should like to congratulate you on your second European act this morning.
President.  
 I would like to make a comment on the way this debate is structured. Our Rules of Procedure state that Commissioners may speak for as long as they wish. Personally, though, I feel that something is out of balance if a Commissioner speaks for twice as long as the three Members before him. Without wishing to restrict their rights under the Rules of Procedure, I would urge the Commission to give some thought to what I have said.
President.  
 Do not take it personally Commissioner. It was just a general remark.
President.  
 Rule 19 in our Rules of Procedure states that the President shall possess all the powers necessary to preside over the proceedings of Parliament. Rule 120 (6) states that the President shall attempt to agree speaking times with the Commission and the Council. Commissioner Barnier, I will now agree to give you eleven minutes, the same that Parliament has had.
President.  
 I assume that the Commission will give a written answer to Mr De Rossa’s question. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0264/2003
) by Mr Ojeda Sanz on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the extension of the 2000-2001 Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Revolutionary People’s Republic of Guinea on fishing off the Guinean coast for the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 (COM (2003) 107
 – C5-0128/2003
 – 2003/0049(CNS))
President.  
 Thank you, Mrs McKenna. Commissioner, I am now going to claim ten seconds for myself. From time to time I still dream about a revolutionary Commission negotiating with a revolutionary People’s Republic, but that is a long way in the future. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0280/2003
) by Mrs Gröner on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a second phase of a programme of Community action (2004-2008) to prevent violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at-risk (the DAPHNE II Programme) (COM (2003) 54
 – C5-0060/2003
 – 2003/0025(COD)) I do not want to conceal from the House my disquiet at the fact that only two men have put themselves down to speak.
President.  
 I understand. The Commission wishes to take the floor again, but I would ask you, Commissioner, to give some thought to the lateness of the hour. According to the Rules of Procedure, of course, you may speak for as long as you wish, but perhaps you might consider keeping an eye on the clock.
President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino. Indeed, the House knows your discipline well. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0268/2003
) by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the Economic Accounts for Agriculture in the Community (COM (2003) 50

President.  
 Mrs Breyer has asked leave to make a personal statement in accordance with Rule 122. Mrs Breyer, I would like to point out to you that you may refer only to statements made concerning yourself in the course of the debate. In other words, please can we not have a new debate?
President.  
 Mrs Breyer, I regret that I have to tell you that what you have said bears little relation to a personal statement, but was more like a contribution to the debate. I had reasons for saying what I said earlier. I would therefore urge you to keep to the rules in future. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
President.  
 The next item should be the joint debate on a number of reports on food safety, but we would have only three minutes available for it before the start of the debate on the Commission communication. There is no point in starting the debate right now. The next item is the Commission communication on proposals for action for strengthening the European pharmaceutical industry in the interest of patients.
President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen. This debate will be conducted according to what we call the catch-the-eye procedure. Mrs Roth-Behrendt has succeeded in catching my 
eye, and she has the floor.
President.  
 Thank you, Mrs Bordes. Let me just point out that, in a debate of the sort we are having at the moment, the idea is to put questions rather than just make speeches. I would ask you to again read the Rules of Procedure in order to see just how this works. That way, there will be no misunderstandings between us next time.
President.  
 The debate is closed. The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
President.  
 The next item is the report (A5-0137/2003
) by Mrs Roure on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal from the Commission with regard to the adoption of a Council directive (COM(2002) 548
  C5-0502/2002
  2002/0242(CNS)) on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of study, vocational training or voluntary service. Before we embark on the debate, I would like to ask you all to keep strictly to your speaking time, or otherwise we will have difficulties when it comes to the votes.
President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino. The debate is closed. The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m. ***

 Despite my serious misgivings, I voted to approve the reports on the applications by Cyprus, Malta, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. My misgivings have nothing to do with these countries, but with the fact that the Treaty of Nice has not made the European Union sufficiently capable of enlargement. As we do not yet know the outcome of the Convention or of the Treaty amendment resulting from it, any decision on enlargement is basically premature. I abstained from the vote on the Republic of Poland, as this country is currently playing an active part in a war that is contrary to international law.
President.  
– The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0086/2003
) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification (COM(2002) 225

President.  
– Thank you very much, Mr Ceyhun. Perhaps I might respond to your observation by commenting that the well-known German comedian, Karl Valentin, once visited the Bavarian Parliament. Halfway through a debate, he left the room. To a journalist's question, ‘Why did you do that, Mr Valentin?’ he replied that everything had already been said, but not yet by everybody. With that in mind, many thanks for your contribution.

President Trajkovski, you are very welcome to the European Parliament today. It is a great honour and privilege for me to be able to introduce you to our House. In this Parliament we know all too well what the countries in your region have gone through in the past decade, and in particular the ordeal by arms and violence which you have all had to live through, but nonetheless yours is a country which in its current phase brings us a certain message of hope. The crisis in 2001 was one which, with active assistance from the international community – including, I am proud to say, a very hands-on and determined approach by the European Union – managed to avoid slipping into a costly civil war. It has instead resulted in steady progress in terms of democracy and in your commitment, and the commitment of your country, to developing good neighbourly relations, respecting the rule of law, boosting the economy through trade and cooperation and working through the Ohrid Framework Agreement over time. This provides the bridge for your country to make a full return to its international connections and to a point from which you may begin to realise your European vision. We in this House strongly support the policy of the Union seeking to develop a European perspective for the Western Balkans. Your address here today, and in the context of current progress being made in your country, is an important bridgehead towards the EU for the region in general as well as for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in particular. The recent despicable assassination of Mr Zoran Djindjic in Serbia highlights again to us the need for stability in this region and reminds us of our duty of care to act when we have the capacity to do so and the circumstances present themselves. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, like all the former Yugoslav states, already belongs to the European family. This was explicitly recognised at the European Council in Feira in June 2002. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, like the other countries of the Western Balkans, has a European perspective. We are very pleased in this House that the first ever operation of the European Rapid Reaction Force has started in your Republic. (Applause)
 This is the clearest possible signal of the Union's commitment to the region. Indeed, at a moment when we are living through a sense of Europe having failed to find its voice in an adequate way on the Iraqi crisis and in the UN, we look to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as one of the successes of the embryonic and emerging common foreign and security policy in Europe. (Applause)
 You are now on the path to this European vision which we share. I believe that the speed of your advance depends on you, on your progress in reform, on your political determination and your strong resolve. But each step you take in that direction, we will travel that road with you. That is the message I would like to give you today on behalf of my colleagues here. You can count on our support. It is now my great honour and privilege to invite you to address the House.
President.  
– 
We thank President Trajkovski for taking the time to be here, for his shared European vision, for his message of partnership and for his expression of hope for future developments and opportunity, both in his country and region and in their relations with Europe. We thank you. (Applause)

Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. We now have an opportunity for the Members present to put brief and precise questions as described in Rule 38. We will follow the so-called catch the eye
 procedure. That is always rather tricky if the President is short-sighted, but, as most of the usual suspects are present, it should work.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ good report on the modification of the protocol to the fisheries agreement with Greenland shows once again that justified criticisms can be made of its content and application. These come not only from the rapporteur of the Committee on Fisheries, but also from the Committee on Budgets. I agree with the rapporteur when she calls for the financial expenditure for this agreement to be adapted to the actual situation. Her call for a general evaluation report and a cost-benefit analysis also has my full support. Parliament has been calling for this for a long time for fisheries agreements with third countries. I cannot, however, support the rapporteur’s call for the Commission to reallocate unused fishing opportunities to another Member State on request, even if that allocation were limited to just one fishing campaign. In my opinion, this would have a very serious effect on the common fisheries policy principle of relative stability. The possibility of transferring or exchanging allocated fishing quotas must continue to be a Member State competence. After all, the sustainable use of fish stocks benefits from unused fishing opportunities. If parts of allocated quotas go unused because of particular foreseeable circumstances, however, then bilateral contractual arrangements between the Member States are still the appropriate way of dealing with that. The Commission may be allowed to intervene here in a regulatory capacity. Anything more than that, however, would seriously undermine the basis of the common fisheries policy. I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 2 but to vote against Amendment No 5 in tomorrow’s vote.
Kindermann (PSE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as time goes by, we in this Parliament find ourselves passing into law many proposals for legislation introduced by the Commission following on from its White Paper on Food Safety. In so doing, we are making a vital contribution to the improvement of EU law on food and feedingstuffs, while also ensuring that Europe’s consumers recover their confidence – which had been lost –in the safety of their food. This case is no different. Both Parliament and the Council are agreed that the essential significance of this draft regulation is that, from 1 January 2006 onwards, antibiotics will, once and for all, be banned as additives in animal feed. What Parliament has been calling for for years, this regulation is now bringing to pass. Let me now turn, though, to the specific aspects that have concerned us in the course of second reading. Today’s vote presents us with two alternatives – firstly, the amendments voted on in the committee, and, secondly, the compromise amendments negotiated by the rapporteur with the Council and the Commission, which are intended to make a long and laborious conciliation procedure unnecessary. The Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to support the compromise, and we did not exactly find that easy, having agreed in the committee that coccidiostats and histomonostats – the fundamental bone of contention between Parliament and the Council – would be permitted only until the end of 2008, which position was not – as is well known – supported by a majority on the Council. These substances are of great importance in poultry farming, and I have to say that I have no interest in banning their use. On the contrary, they must, in future, be removed from the category of additives to feedingstuffs and be categorised as subject to the legislation on veterinary medicines. Only thus can they be administered in a controlled way through prescription by a veterinary surgeon who knows the situation in the farm in question and can respond to it in an appropriate way. Failing that, the generalised prophylactic use of these substances – some of which are antibiotics – may well cover up any hygiene problems that exist on farms and in businesses. It was therefore of primary importance to us that we should today come to a decision in principle on what is to be done about coccidiostats and histomonostats, and, in this, the sequence of events was, ultimately, of only secondary importance. Compromise Amendment No 16 fixes a date for the cessation of the use of these substances as additives to feedingstuffs, that being December 2012, and, when seen in comparison with the Common Position, that amounts to major progress. We would certainly have liked to see them stop being used at an earlier date, but, even after the compromise has been reached, that is still possible, if – as the same amendment states – we ask the Commission, in January 2008, for a report and a legislative proposal. Should further progress have been made by then on the development of usable alternatives, we will then be able to agree with the Commission and the Council on an earlier date for the cessation of use. By adopting the compromise and by refraining from a conciliation procedure, Parliament has demonstrated that it is willing to cooperate, and let me make it perfectly clear at this juncture that we expect the same willingness to cooperate from the Commission and the Council at the consultations scheduled for 2008. The Council has met us halfway as regards another point, namely the labelling of flavourings. In this regard, we take the view that it is necessary to have a rule that is in line with the provisions applicable to flavourings used in the production of food. Why more stringent standards should apply in the area of animal nutrition than do in the field of food production, is incomprehensible. Should there be, though, in future, provisions on food that impose the labelling of all ingredients of flavourings, we will, of course, also have to apply them to feedingstuffs.

Mr President, I would like to speak principally on the report by Mr Cunha. As regards the other reports, I want to mention only the question of intervention in rye, which the Commission proposes should be done away with and not replaced. I therefore support the proposal on intervention in the form in which we modified it in the Souchet report in the Committee. There must continue in future to be the possibility of compensation for certain specified sites, the natural characteristics of which allow only a limited number of economic alternatives. Let me turn, though, to the Cunha report, which I wholeheartedly endorse. It incorporates elements that we social democrats have repeatedly called for, such as the requirement for both modulation and cross-compliance, as well as aspects related to the protection of animals. The preamble inserted before Article 1 reflects this House’s priorities: a secure income for farmers along with support for environmental protection and employment in rural areas. What I see as important in this is that Parliament is strongly advocating that a start be made on decoupling aid from production; in the text voted on by the Committee, though, this affirmation is still very muted and vague. This, in my view, is where we have to choose a form of words that clarifies what we are calling for. It is for this reason that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled amendments providing for decoupling to start, in 2005, at 50% and, following the presentation of a report from the Commission in 2007, for it to rise progressively and be extended to other sectors. This is especially important, as, in the compromise motions, we have agreed on the partial decoupling of only two sectors. Much as we should, certainly, welcome this introduction of decoupling, we should not lose sight of the longer-term perspective. So I hope that the Group of the Party of European Socialists’ Amendments Nos 126 and 127 will be endorsed, as these amendments will enable Parliament to send the Council a more emphatic message. Let me conclude by addressing yet another important aspect, that of renewable raw materials. These offer farmers in many regions great potential for viable alternative crops while, at the same time, having a positive effect on the environment. The possibility that our amendment – in contrast to the Commission proposal – will continue to enable set aside areas to be used for cultivating renewable raw materials is one that I very much welcome.

Mr President, a very important aspect of the common fisheries policy is the communication from the Commission on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture of September 2002. I therefore greatly welcome the initiative of the Committee on Fisheries to subject aquaculture in the European Union to a thorough investigation in an own–initiative report. The increasing importance of this sector of the fisheries industry is not only due to its steady growth in recent years; it can also be regarded as a genuine alternative to the dwindling stocks worldwide of marine fauna used for human consumption. It also has positive effects on the labour market, and – a point which should be emphasised – not only in coastal regions. A large number of jobs depend directly or indirectly on aquaculture, both in primary production but also in many other sectors. I believe that research in this area is particularly important. The financial resources should undoubtedly be boosted here so that even better recommendations can be made. There are still many unresolved problems in aquaculture. Let me cite a few: the use of pharmaceuticals, minimising environmental impacts, food safety for consumers, improving production units in line with more stringent animal welfare standards, and, not least, protecting wild species from genetically manipulated fish species. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, very warmly for his very thorough investigation of this issue. We will undoubtedly have reason to continue our debate on aquaculture in future.

Mr President, this evening we are debating three proposals for regulations which form what I think is the most important part of the package of common fisheries policy reforms and we therefore need to remind ourselves why reform is so urgently needed. One of the most important reasons is that stocks of several species are at a critical level. There are too few fish for too many fishing vessels and the proposed regulations need to be judged in this context. Parliament needs to pluck up courage and stand firm if it is serious about protecting fish stocks. Unfortunately, no thread of real reform runs through Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's reports. I do not think that minor cosmetic corrections are of any use at all in the long term, be it to the fishermen or to the endangered stocks, which are on the verge of collapse. Nor do I totally agree that we should call the voluntary scrapping measures proposed by the Commission into question. The emphasis here is on voluntary; to me, everything else is just talk. As far as I am concerned, neither report is acceptable as it stands and I cannot vote for them. The fact that all the proposed measures need a soft social and economic landing is one of our main demands and I think we all now agree on that. But today's debate is about the proposed reforms, not the loss of the Prestige 
and we must not confuse the two. We stand by the Galician fishermen but we must keep our eye on the ball.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of animal nutrition has become something of a regular feature on this House's agenda. Over recent years, we have played a very successful part in shaping EU legislation on animal feedingstuffs. Let me remind you of some examples: the open declaration of feed ingredients, the establishment of a positive list, and the new regulations on the production and use of meal made from meat. Today, we are embarking on a new round which focusses on feed additives. The Group of the Party of European Socialists supports much of what the rapporteur has just mentioned, such as the ban on antibiotics, etc. She has done sterling work, and has been receptive to many of our proposals. I would like to express my sincere thanks to her for that. Overall, then, we are pleased with the report which was voted on in committee. There are two point which should be corrected, however, and which I would like to explain as follows. Coccidiostats and histomonostats should not be authorised for use as feed additives; instead, they should be authorised, in the long term, as veterinary medicinal drugs. We must be consistent here. If we impose a general ban on antibiotics in animal nutrition, we cannot immediately make an exception for one product category. This cannot be justified to consumers. As regards coccidiostats, these must be subject to controlled use as prescribed by a veterinary surgeon who is familiar with the situation in the farm concerned and can respond appropriately. Otherwise, the general preventive use of these products, which are also antibiotics, could conceal possible hygiene problems on the farms. I strenuously refute any accusations that I am trying to generate a new source of income for veterinary surgeons. We have tabled amendments on this issue, and I would ask you to support them. My second point relates to the duration of authorisation. We support authorisation for an unlimited period, provided that this does not impact on product safety. A re-evaluation of the additives should therefore be carried out every ten years, taking account of new scientific information and research data. This ensures reliability for the applicant, on the one hand, and animal and consumer safety, on the other.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are no doubt all agreed that the common fisheries policy needs to be reformed, but great differences become apparent as soon as discussion turns to the detailed modalities of reform. These have to do not only with how we assess the situation, which is at present, indeed, not exactly rosy, but also with what measures are to be taken. We even take different views of the scientific investigations into our resources, as shown by the report on our timetable, which we are discussing this evening, and I imagine that discussions in the Council of Ministers are just as animated as our own in Parliament. As Europe's Parliament, though, we should be concentrating on the points of fact and attempting to play an active part in fashioning a reform whose prime objective will be to maintain fishery resources. We are talking about the precautionary principle, and cuts, painful though they may be, are probably necessary to secure sustainable management of fish stocks and hence the long-term survival of fishery as a whole. The social component of the measures we are to decide on, however, plays a key role in this. I therefore call on all Members of this House, as well as the Fisheries Ministers, to fulfil their responsibility for fishery as a whole in the European Union and to distance themselves from myopic national interests when deciding what shape the reform is to take. We should not now let the great opportunity pass to decide on a fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy. We have to make use of this opportunity, or else the prospects for our fisheries in Europe will, in the foreseeable future, be bleak indeed. That this is so is already demonstrated very clearly by the current state of cod stocks in the North Sea, and I hope that will be a lesson to us.

 Mr President, we can take it as read, on the basis of current scientific research, that foot and mouth disease is, of all viral infections, one of the most dangerous to our stocks of cloven-hoofed animals. The situation is that this dangerous animal disease spreads in an explosive manner if it is introduced in unvaccinated stocks. We saw that happen recently, when foot and mouth disease broke out in Great Britain. We also know what damage then ensues. It is irrelevant whether foot and mouth disease has broken out or is present in South Korea or in another country of the world. The mobility of people and goods, which can be transferred from one place to another in the shortest conceivable time, means that the risk is always present. So I ask the Commission whether the prophylactic resources are sufficient to avert this danger in the long term. We know that the European strategy for combating animal diseases still has its flaws. The state of knowledge, which must normally increase over time, is unchanged as regards what happens in the absence of vaccination. I ask the Commission whether the attempt should not be made to alter the animal diseases strategy in future, with particular reference to foot and mouth disease, in such a way that prophylaxis is monitored far better. As Mrs Redondo and her predecessors on the floor said, prophylaxis of course begins at the airport or on the train. Prophylaxis is, though, also to a very significant extent, a matter for the individual stock farmer, and I must say, some very worrying things come to light. When I run an open day for visitors to my farm, there is no doubt in my mind; I always see people from the towns running through the stables without taking any steps whatever to prevent the spread of disease. Taking all these things together, I would consider it possible to stop this dangerous disease in its tracks. Let me plainly say here and now that I very much question the assumption on which we have based our actions over the past years, namely that we can stamp it out across the board. So I urge the implementation of a prophylaxis worthy of the name, and I ask the Commission to give an appropriate answer on the subject.

Mr President, Commissioner, I have a question on the prohibited substances. It is the case that, in future, certain substances will be banned in the European Union, as they have been in the past. How will the Commission guarantee in future that these substances will be tested for in the Member States? How are products containing these substances to be prevented from getting onto the market, as products containing nitrofen are at present managing to do in Germany? They have been banned for some considerable time, during which nitrofen has not once been tested for. When it was discovered, it was done so fortuitously.

 Due to an oversight, a number of motions for separate votes or votes in sections were not tabled in time on behalf of my group and the oral motion for separate votes on three proposed amendments tabled by our coordinator was rejected. I should therefore like to state, as rapporteur, that I reject Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 17 and only accept the end of Amendment No 11, i.e. the words "The Commission shall inform the competent authorities, the Member States and the European Parliament of the result of the checks carried out"
, as an addendum to the original Commission text. I support Amendment No 16 without the words "by means of the early warning system"
. However, as the report contains other, far more important amendments, I did of course vote in favour of the amendments voted en bloc
 and I voted in favour of the legislative resolution itself, even though I do not agree with the content of all the amendments.

 Mr President, the package of proposals for regulations we have before us aims to reformulate and simplify the entire body of EU food law. The draft regulation for which I am rapporteur lays down specific animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation from third countries of products of animal origin, with the objective of preventing the spread of animal diseases in connection with the marketing of these products. At present, this area is governed by seven different directives. The proposal for a regulation under consideration is intended to make the animal-health rules more transparent and encompass the existing directives within a single text. I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has deliberately chosen a regulation as the legal instrument so as to ensure that the rules will in future be enforced in the same way in the EU as a whole and in third countries. Overall, I support the proposal, even if I have one fundamental criticism of it. In many places the Commission has used the procedure referred to in Article 11, that is to say the committee procedure. This is neither unusual nor anything special. Particularly in the field of animal disease prevention it is right and important for the Commission to be able to react more quickly and effectively to new scientific developments and unforeseen situations, without having to embark on a cumbersome legislative procedure every time. However, in this case I believe that rather too much use is made of the committee procedure. In some places I have therefore introduced either additions or refinements to the text of the regulation establishing certain criteria. The first of these is that exceptions should only be granted if the animal disease situation does not prevent it and if it would in no way adversely affect the level of protection against animal diseases. Secondly, unannounced checks should be carried out at irregular intervals. Thirdly, when lists of third countries are being drawn up, all additional factors such as the adequacy of staffing levels in the control authorities and the reliability of the information provided by authorities in third countries must be taken into account. In addition, I have included two new proposals in my report. Member States and the authorities of third countries shall, where so requested, submit a report to the Commission on the controls carried out, specifying in particular the frequency of controls, the nature of the failings and infringements found to exist, and the nature of the steps taken by the competent authorities to punish them. We all know that the effectiveness of the legal framework depends to a large extent on controls carried out, and detailed control reports of this kind are essential if the effective application of controls in Member States is to be guaranteed. They also allow the Commission to react immediately to any weak points identified. The Commission should also draw up a list of categories of possible infringements of this regulation, its implementing rules or safeguard measures and should determine in each instance whether the infringements are punishable by the competent national authorities under criminal or administrative law. If the provisions of the regulation are infringed, uniform sanctions should as far as possible be established for all Member States. It is not acceptable for the same act to have different consequences in Member State No 1 as compared with Member State No 2. This problem, which is certainly even more urgent in other areas than in the case before us today, needs to be fundamentally addressed. It was my intention to make a start here with my proposal, even if the Commission has indicated to the committee that this kind of approach may not be practicable at the moment for legal reasons. Nevertheless, I am convinced of the need for this and my fellow members of the committee supported me in this. I would lastly like to thank the Commission for its constructive cooperation and I hope that will continue.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has again postponed the enactment of the proposals for the reform of the common fisheries policy, which was originally to take place last week. That has, at least, the advantage that they have another few weeks, or maybe even longer, to incorporate into their proposals for reform the suggestions for future fleet management in my report, on which we are voting today. Now, then, to my report, in which I have consciously limited myself to the Commission's report on the implementation of the multi-annual guidance programmes for reducing fleets. As we are at the crucial stage of preparations for the reform of the common fisheries policy as a whole and thus also of the fleet policy in particular, I would like to express a view on the MAGPs in general, pointing out a number of problems to which consideration must be given at all costs when the reforms are set in train. There are only two – identically-worded – amendments to be voted on today, and I, as rapporteur, can support them without further ado. What this shows is that the Committee on Fisheries is as one in its assessment 
that the Commission's report for 2000, like its predecessors, had shown one thing above all, namely that the MAGPs have not achieved their objective of significantly reducing fleet capacity and thus the fishing effort. We regret the fact that the majority of the Member States again failed to reach the target set by their MAGP. We call on these to make substantial efforts to reduce their fleets, at the same time welcoming the way that the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings against several Member States which have repeatedly not kept to their MAGP objectives. We also emphatically call on the Council and the Commission, both at the same time, to analyse the reasons why these targets were not met and develop more effective sanctions. In addition, we call on the Commission, when formulating its proposals for a new fleet policy, to deal specifically with the need for a balance between the fishing capacities and/or fishing efforts of each Member State's fleet segment and the catch possibilities available to it. Last week, Commissioner Fischler told the Committee on Fisheries that the European Union's fishing vessels are about 40% over capacity, a figure that is not only alarming but also underlines all the more the urgent need for something to be done about this. The primary cause of this over-capacity is that the instrument used to make cuts in the fleet did not achieve its objective and that there has even been a measurable increase in fleet capacity in recent years. There is therefore urgent need for this problem to be dealt with, but, in doing so, it is imperative that the Commission ensure that the fishing fleet is reduced in a socially acceptable manner, by setting up Community financial aid to cushion social hardship. One effective means would be premiums appealing to the fishermen, which the European Union and the Member States together could use to buy up fishing tonnage and either destroy it, sell it, or use it for purposes other than fishing. The payment of such premiums should be mandatory, and, moreover, the possibility of an increase in the Community's financial contribution should be examined. The previous system led to the situation in which fishermen wanting to leave the business, or having already done so, sell their ship's tonnage on the market, so that even more of the fleet is bought up by efficient companies, yet this does not result in any reduction in capacity. At the end of the day, efforts to reduce fleet capacity must not be to the detriment of on-board working conditions, the vessel's safety, or the quality of the catch. Structural aid must therefore continue to be used to modernise the fleet, but means and ways have to be found to prevent the fishing effort being increased at the same time. I am aware that the production of a balanced proposal is no easy task for the Commission, and we are already eagerly awaiting its proposals for reform. I will conclude by thanking all my fellow MEPs who have helped with this difficult task, and, in particular, the Commission for its constructive cooperation. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, most of us agree that we achieved a very good result in the Conciliation Committee. I therefore wish, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to congratulate, above all, the rapporteur on his commitment to the matter in hand and, most of all, warmly thank him for cooperating so well with his other colleagues, too. If the result is confirmed by this House as a whole, it will represent a further significant step towards greater transparency and safety in the production of feedingstuffs. In addition to this proposal for a regulation, though, there are other reports which also deal with feedingstuffs and with regard to which negotiations are currently in progress between Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Commission. I am thinking here only of the draft regulation on animal by-products not intended for human consumption – especially Category III, but also of the future use of leftovers from meals and waste from the production of foodstuffs. I do think that it should continue to be possible to use these by-products, processed under secure conditions and subject to strict controls and, above all, with the stages in processing being effectively monitored, as high-quality feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, unless the results of future scientific research suggest otherwise. I look forward to the same willingness to compromise, not only on the part of Parliament, but also on the part of the Commission and of the Council, as was demonstrated in the process that we are discussing this evening.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on the Transport of Animals, which is under discussion this evening, has borne out what is repeatedly seen on television: the brutal way that animals are treated, the disregard of limits on journey times, the overloading of vehicles and many other breaches of current regulations on the transport of animals, none of which has been an infrequent occurrence. This situation is no longer tolerable, and the European public is right to demand speedy measures to remedy it. I must, though, say quite clearly that European regulations on the transport of animals, when correctly enforced, already guarantee a high degree of protection to animals. As the Committee highlights in its report, the fundamental problem is that the regulations currently in force are applied only very inadequately in most of the Member States. Quite apart from the difficulty of transposing the directive into national law, this is attributable above all to Member States' defective control procedures and the far too weak sanctions imposed when breaches are discovered. Criticism arising out of these problems should therefore be directed mainly at the Member States. In my opinion, the Community control policy needs a thorough re-think here, as comparable problems exist in other areas of veterinary control. I would like, though, to enlarge on two further points. The abolition of export refunds for animals for slaughter, contained in this resolution, was decided on by Parliament in the course of the 2002 Budget procedure and has long been demanded by Social Democrats. In the past, Parliament has already given financially preferential treatment to meat as opposed to livestock for slaughter in paying export refunds, in order to remove the economic incentive from the export of live animals. At present, then, only about one-half in export refund is paid for livestock in comparison with meat. Even that, though, is not yet enough, and export refunds for animals for slaughter should be reduced to zero. The other point I would like to make is that the proposal for a resolution calls for a maximum transport time of 8 hours for animals intended for slaughter, and that, too, is an old demand from the Social Democrats. There is to be no general maximum journey time, and prime consideration was given to the situation of remote regions and islands. Here, too, there will be limited exceptions to the rules on maximum journey time, which we greatly welcome. In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of the Social Democrat Group, to thank Mr Maat for the constructive work we have done together, and I believe it will continue in future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, extending the multi-annual guidance programmes by one year to keep them in force pending the decision on future fleet policy after 2002 is sensible and I think it has everyone’s support in principle. The MAGP’s objectives are correct, but their implementation by the Member States still leaves much to be desired. The Commission’s reports in the past have shown us that over and over again. We have repeatedly criticised the failings in implementation and it is clear that the future fleet policy will have to remedy the situation. That is why the Commission wants to make changes to the MAGP and FIFG provisions as well as extending them by a year. I am opposed to some of those changes because I think these matters would be better resolved in the landmark decision about fleet policy. In my opinion there is no point in making extensive changes in the last year of MAGP IV’s validity, especially when they could have negative repercussions for safety on board fishing vessels. But if Member States are to continue to be able to apply for increases in capacity for measures designed to improve on-board safety and fishery product hygiene and these are to be paid for out of FIFG resources, something really must be done to ensure that those measures do not result in increased fishing. This condition is absolutely essential. We cannot have a situation where investments in on-board safety are prevented because the conditions for the application of the measures are not complied with or because many Member States are sometimes unable to ensure that they are or fail to do so. We ought to be using the debate about common fisheries policy reform to find solutions to the dilemma between on-board safety and careful management of stocks that has again been made clear by this report. No way must the one be at the expense of the other.

Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo, for her work, which is unexpectedly topical following the most recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth. The parallels between swine fever and foot-and-mouth are obvious; in the case both of foot-and-mouth and swine fever, the Community decided in the past to pursue a policy of non-vaccination. However, the scale of the foot-and-mouth crisis has demonstrated that an unreserved policy of non-vaccination belongs on the test bench. I do not mean that we should resort to blanket vaccination in future. Killing infected stock, stamping out, must continue to be the mainstay of the strategy to combat these diseases. However, greater importance should be attached to vaccination. We should not, in my view, stand still on the question of vaccination; instead we should develop a strategy of comprehensive zoonosis prevention mainly for use during disease-free periods. This could include stricter controls on third country imports, controls at airports and quarantining new additions to livestock. Another important point is the principle of regionalisation. The Commission must act very quickly here and negotiate with EU trading partners in order to implement this principle. We cannot expect all the Member States of the EU to put up with import restrictions in third countries every time a disease breaks out in one or a few Member States. The European Union already applies this principle to third country imports. Now third countries must return the favour. Marker vaccines are very important here, as the rapporteur has clearly highlighted. More must be invested in these vaccines and in developing discriminatory diagnostic techniques, so that it will soon be possible to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals and then make economic use of vaccinated animals. I should also like to comment on one more very specific issue, namely swill feeding, that is, using leftovers from canteens etc. These leftovers have been used as animal fodder for years and we must still be able to use them in future. As with meat and bonemeal, I support a conditional ban here, as formulated in Amendment No 37 by the Group of the Greens, that is, it should only be possible to use leftovers if a suitable sterilisation process is used. I think that if proper controls are carried out then, as we have seen in the past in numerous Member States, we will still be able to use this valuable source of protein. We should support the proposed amendment by the Greens which still allows leftovers to be used but subject to stricter conditions.

Mr President, following intensive negotiations and an excellent job by Mr Busk, we are now in a position to debate his report here in Parliament. On behalf of my group, I should like to thank both him and Mr Maat for their work. I think that the compromise proposals negotiated will bring us another step forward in improving how pigs are kept. But it is and remains just a compromise. Optimum demands, often couched in emotional terms, are self-evident but cannot be implemented as they stand. In the final analysis, every new legal framework has a huge impact on the people affected. It is important here for us to have flexible transition times. Adjusting to other or new animal husbandry systems takes time and, more importantly, costs money. The conditions of competition are particular harsh in the pig production sector. I should like briefly to address another two points: first, extra space for fattening pigs and, secondly, castration. Neither is covered by the Commission proposal but I think that the European Parliament should set higher standards for the protection of animals here. The 1997 Scientific Veterinary Committee report on the welfare of pigs gives us a starting point here, especially for the space which fattening pigs require. We would not be able to get the general ban on the castration of pigs which some people are calling for across to German consumers in my view. Whether or not double vaccination of males can replace castration only time will tell. But I think this is the most practical solution. As far as the timetable is concerned, I think we have found an acceptable compromise. Holdings will have time to change their production methods over a fairly long period of time. Finally, I call on the House to adopt the report as it stands.
Kindermann (PSE

Mr President, animal by-products which are suitable in principle for human consumption must also continue to be available as animal feed once they have been properly processed. I cannot understand why anyone would want to impose a permanent ban on this valuable source of protein. I do, however, support the present temporary ban on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed. The current rules and checks must be strictly applied. Once this is guaranteed, it should be possible to use meat and bone meal once again. Another specific point concerns the use of leftovers from large restaurants and catering establishments. For decades these leftovers have been used to produce a highly nutritious pig feed. This must remain possible in future, which is why I support Amendment No 102 as tabled by the Greens. Finally, let me say a few words on the avoidance of cannibalism in the feeding of animals. I believe that the separation by species of material for processing into meat and bone meal would be very difficult to achieve. Pigs, hens, fish and so on have no scruples about eating their own kind. I am at a complete loss to understand why animals are now being expected to comply with human ethical standards. I hope we shall remain realistic on this point, because the proposed compulsory separation of by-products by species will not enable us to prevent cannibalism among animals.

Mr President, we greatly welcome the fact that the issue of animal welfare is being discussed by the Council and the Commission in the European Parliament today. The Community's obligation to take full account of animal welfare requirements within the framework of its agricultural policy is anchored in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The question which now arises in this context is whether this is sufficient for the Community or whether there should be European framework legislation on animal welfare in future. Sadly, animal welfare is not understood the same way everywhere. Laws are one thing; the actual treatment of, and attitude towards, animals are another. The responsibility for animals as living creatures falls exclusively on humans. For this reason, it is important to start teaching children how to treat animals responsibly when they are still very young. Anyone who goes on to handle animals in the course of their work, who farms them or transports them, must have a certificate proving their suitability and skills. Animal welfare also has an impact on farms' competitiveness, however. There will have to be restrictions on livestock farming for economic purposes in future too. Demands for optimum conditions, which often stem from emotional responses, cannot always be translated directly into practice. Viable solutions must be devised. The classification of animals as farm animals, breeding animals and pets is not an arbitrary one, after all. Economic considerations and global competition ultimately compel us to adopt specific conditions of animal husbandry, thus limiting the scope for truly animal-centred livestock farming. However, these farming conditions must be shaped in a way which ensures that animals have the maximum scope for natural behaviour. Political decisions on animal welfare can now be based on comprehensive scientific knowledge of the different species. The laws on animal welfare should only be developed and improved with the involvement of those concerned. In a holistic view of animal protection, the animals' natural behaviour and needs should be compatible with environmental concerns and consumer protection, but also with the expectation of profit. Our society's high standards of hygiene must also not be compromised. After all, more consumer protection ultimately leads to better conditions of animal welfare.

 Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in its common position, the Council did not adopt a complete and open statement but simply a meagre compromise which merely calls for a declaration according to brackets of percentages by weight. This does not tally with the notion of comprehensive transparency in the production of feedingstuffs, which we have called for on numerous occasions. Farmers do not yet know what and how many primary products are contained in feedingstuffs. That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the recommendation of the rapporteur, who systematically integrated the open declaration of feed materials in the text of the draft directive. He also repeated the demand for a legally binding positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. The Commission has been requested to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2001. This too has our full support. Surely it cannot be so very difficult to draw up a list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. At least we know what the various feedingstuffs should as a rule contain, or perhaps, after what has been said, we do not. The eight months proposed by the rapporteur seem to me to be a reasonable and adequate time within which to draw up such a list. This list is urgent, since we cannot do without industrially produced feedingstuffs in the future. Just like people, animals need balanced nutrition. If they are only fed water, hay and cereals, which was called for in the past, this would not satisfy current conditions for agricultural production and is, in my opinion, a far cry from reality. Given that feedingstuffs are the most important part of meat production we must ensure that these feedingstuffs are safe. How else can we restore consumer confidence in meat. All in all, the Council would be well advised to accept Parliament’s proposals without amending them and to demonstrate that it has learnt from past mistakes. We cannot wait until it is too late and then tinker about with the symptoms. (Applause)

 Mr President, how should and how will the European Union's common fisheries policy look after 2002? This question has stirred the emotions of everyone involved in fisheries for some time now. The Poignant and Gallagher reports are important milestones in the preliminary debate. The actual debate on reform will, however, not start until the Commission's Green Paper has been submitted within the next few months although, quite understandably, representatives of highly disparate fisheries interests in the European Union are already trying to influence the preparatory process within the Commission. A great many demands have been made on the Commission. I think it is still too early for the European Parliament to commit itself one way or another. We should confine ourselves, within the framework of these two reports, to addressing the problems and discussing various possible solutions. Both rapporteurs have done a great deal of work and have highlighted the basic problems of the common fisheries policy and I am grateful to them for that. I should like to single out just three of these basic problems. First, the problem of access to waters, which should at least be re-examined as part of the reform. Protection zones must be defined on the basis of scientific studies and the relevant conclusions must be drawn from their results. Secondly: regionalisation is another catchword which repeatedly gives rise to controversial debate. But regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation. We have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to stay. Thirdly: I should like to finish by again highlighting how important it is for the whole fisheries sector – fishermen, science, industry and so on – to be involved in the forthcoming reform process. This is the only way we shall be able to ensure that the new common fisheries policy is well accepted by those whom it affects.

 Madam President, less than four weeks ago the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health rules for animal by-products not intended for human consumption. The aim of this is to avoid not only microbiological but also chemical contamination of feedingstuffs in future. In my opinion, the scope of this proposal is already wide, and it takes account of the precautionary principle. In the interests of a sustainable closed substance cycle it should still be possible to use properly tested animal materials deemed fit for human consumption in the production of feedingstuffs. We have to be realistic. There is no scientific justification for a general ban on using animal meal for all animals. Why should it cover pigs, poultry and fish, as some Member States and some Members here have been demanding? If you take the arguments of some Members of this House to their logical conclusion, you would also have to ban sales of wild boar meat. What is far more important, in the spirit of the Commission proposal, is to work towards ensuring that animal meal complies with the highest safety standards. Farms and factories that do not at present apply the highest technological standards to animal meal production should have their production licence withdrawn until they can demonstrate that they are meeting those standards. Regular and strict checks of technological standards and compliance with legislation on animal meal production should form part of a comprehensive safety concept.
Kindermann (PSE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can still happen, or at least it cannot be ruled out, that contaminated primary products will find their way into animal feed again at some future juncture. Whether this will be intentional, in other words a criminal act, or accidental is not the subject of today's debate. If this does happen, however, it will be crucial to know which amounts of which contaminated primary product have entered the feed in question. An indication of components, summarised according to category and listed by descending order of percentage weight, would not, in our view, suffice for this purpose. It is therefore absolutely imperative that full details of all the primary products contained in compound feedingstuffs, together with the percentage volume of each, should be a statutory requirement. The Socialist Group endorses the statements made by the rapporteur in his conclusions on the open declaration of feed ingredients. This mandatory explicit declaration must be part of a comprehensive safety system governing the production of animal feed. Livestock feed is, after all, the main input in the production of meat. Defects in the safety and verification system increase the risk of further food scandals and ultimately lead to a loss of consumer confidence in meat as a food product. And it is always the farmer who suffers in the end. Farmers not only have to be able to rely on the information provided by the feedingstuffs industry; they must also be able to check, on the basis of the declaration, which volumes of which raw materials are contained in livestock feed. We believe that complete transparency for farmers is essential. Finally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for their contributions, and I hope that the Council will adopt a constructive position on this matter, so that we can jointly arrive at a transparent system of declarations for feedingstuffs. (Applause)

 Mr President, many aspects of the common position we have here reflect Parliament’s position at first reading, and this demonstrates the Council’s willingness to work with Parliament in order to achieve a positive and rapid outcome in this area, which is so important for European consumers. I would have liked to simply approve the common position without further ado. However, I find one point that has already been mentioned several times enormously difficult – category of animal. This comes under compulsory labelling, where it has no place to be. Category of animal really does not assist the regulation’s objective of guaranteeing meat traceability. I therefore support the adoption of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5. The Council will now have to remove the provisions relating to category of animal at its meeting in mid-July if it does not want to risk the regulation not coming into force on 1 September this year. Secondly, there is Amendment No 4 on minced beef, which relates to the last part of Article 14, first paragraph, beginning “and origin”. I am afraid I cannot follow this either. In my view, this amendment lacks precision. How is ‘origin’ to be defined here? Does it refer to where the animal was born or where it was fattened, or both, and who is responsible for labelling here? Exactly how will origin be indicated? None of this is clearly worded and I see a risk that the Council will refuse point blank to accept this amendment, so that we will end up with a conciliation procedure, which will in turn further delay the entry into force of the regulation. This is not in the interests of consumers, and I therefore call on the House to reject Amendments Nos 4 and 6.

Mr President, as draftsman of the Committee on Agriculture, I should like to recapitulate a number of the committee’s main causes for concern on this question. The most important objective of the Commission proposal – and I should like expressly to stress this once again – is the traceability of beef or bovine animals from birth through to processing and sale. This is one of the consequences of the BSE crisis and we must bear the objective of this proposal, i.e. traceability, in mind when debating what information should appear on the label. We want labels which are practicable, simple, safe, cheap and easy to control. Labels must be easy for consumers to understand, which is why the information needs to be kept to a minimum. Consumers want information, not a novel. Information on the fattening process and, where applicable, on antibiotics or other stimulants administered, as demanded in proposed Amendment No 48, have absolutely no business to be on the label. Information which does not come under compulsory labelling but which is requested by market participants or is already included on labels in the Member States can continue to be included within the framework of voluntary labelling. This applies in particular to information on the region of origin of the meat. As far as the entry into force of the regulation is concerned, we agree in principle with the Commission’s approach that compulsory labelling should be introduced in two stages, but we do not agreed with the timetable insofar as we think that the date of 1 January 2003 has been put far too far back. We shall have problems explaining this to consumers. The Committee on Agriculture agreed on the wording “by 1 January 2002 at the latest” in a compromise on the introduction of compulsory information on origin, i.e. stage 2. Now the Committee on the Environment has opted for 1 September 2001 and I think that we can agree to this date. It is only a matter of four months. But we are emphatically against making all the information, including the indication of the place of birth, compulsory when the regulation enters into force in September 2000, rather than in two stages. That makes no sense, as the electronic database on which traceability depends is not yet up and running in the majority of Member States. A compulsory labelling system for beef can only be as good as the system for registering bovine animals and all their movements.

Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs. In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months. That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted. In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission. The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support. However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal. The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives. Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded. This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998. This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed. The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point. This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs. It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example. The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect. On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs. Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble. I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne’s reply.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we discussed the question of beef labelling here in plenary as early as February 1997. At the time we, as the European Parliament, voted in favour of the immediate introduction of the compulsory labelling system. However, the Council decided on an initially optional labelling system and postponed the compulsory system until January 2000. We are now being asked to agree to a further postponement of one year, as there has been a delay in the implementation of the applicable regulation 820/97. The Member States and the Commission alone are to blame for these delays. The Commission justifies the delay by saying that the progress reports from the Member States, which form the basis for the general rules governing a compulsory system, were received too late. In our opinion, the Commission and the Member States did not make a conscientious effort to ensure that the compulsory beef labelling system would enter into force as planned. The Commission must therefore be prepared to answer the question of why it did not take the Member States to task earlier. After all, the Member States were obliged to ensure that the conditions needed for complete proof of origin for cattle were in place and that their electronic data bases were up and running by 31 December this year. The Commission’s contention, that the presentation of its proposal was delayed because the outcome of the case pending against the Council before the European Court of Justice on the legal basis for Regulation 820/97 has not yet been decided, is also unacceptable. Even if the judgement had been made, it would still have been extremely difficult to complete a codecision procedure on this matter. We cannot sanction a further postponement of one year without reservation; otherwise we may well be forced again this time next year to agree to a further postponement because some Member States have again failed to do their homework. We will give the Member States a further eight months to catch up but the compulsory system must
 be definitively introduced in all Member States and for everyone marketing beef on 1 September 2000. The Commission has time until then to submit implementing provisions for the compulsory system. At the same time, the European Parliament and the Council will decide on a new version of Regulation 820/97 under a codecision procedure. This approach will enable the compulsory system to be introduced earlier than envisaged by the Commission in its proposal and will give all those concerned sufficient time to find a lasting and satisfactory solution. In conclusion, I should like once again to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for taking account of the amendment proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development; I think it is important, here and now, for the European Parliament to speak with one voice and to send out a clear signal on this matter of fundamental importance to consumers. I would also like, once again, to thank all those who have worked on this and the services for their fast work and self-sacrifice.

Mr President, today we are at last discussing the definitive ban on the administration and marketing of BST in the European Union and, hopefully, this will mark an end to the ten-year process during which the final decision has been postponed time and time again on the grounds, of course, that there was no conclusive scientific evidence which justified a definitive ban. We are now in possession of this evidence and it confirms that the use of this hormone pushes cows to their physiological limits. The consequences are leg and foot injuries, stomach/intestinal malfunctions and impaired fertility, not to mention the increase in mastitis. Cows are therefore subjected to unnecessary pain. This is unacceptable for reasons of animal welfare, but have all the risks to human health been excluded? What about BST residues in the body which have not been broken down, what about the possible change in the composition of the milk, not to mention the increase in the antibiotics administered in order to treat the sick cows. I would therefore like to support the rapporteur’s request that we step up efforts to clear up the question of the effect of BST on human health once and for all. On behalf of the group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert as rapporteur for her rapid work and we, of course, emphatically support her report.

 Madam President, it is as the Commission says in its explanatory statement. This proposal on the common organisation of the markets in fisheries and aquaculture products is of central importance for the common fisheries policy in the European Union. If we take a look at the general aims in the explanatory statement of the proposal, then we will see that we can give these our full and unequivocal support. Responsible stock management, improving the competitiveness of the sector, liberalisation of the market etc. I am completely in favour of all these statements. What does give cause for concern though is the question as to which methods the Commission, and in particular the rapporteur, intend to employ in their efforts to maintain these principles. I would like to comment just on three points. Firstly, I consider that, in future, one issue to be addressed will be that of establishing extensive, direct grants for the fisheries sector, as previous regulations failed to do. Now, of course, no one has anything against grants. But still the question must be asked as to whether this approach will, in the long term, achieve the goal of boosting the competitiveness of the sector. Even when a deadline is proposed, this always has certain consequences and so we should not rule out maintaining this state of affairs indefinitely. In my view, we could look to the structural funds policy for a more suitable option. Secondly, I wholeheartedly endorse the efforts being made to adapt the regime governing trade with third countries. The only question in this respect is whether they actually go far enough. After all, the fact of the matter is that we in the EU are highly dependent on imports. To a certain extent, the fish processing industry is dependent on tariff reduction and suspension arrangements for its survival. Thirdly, I am unable to support the rapporteur in her desire to include aquaculture products in the intervention regime. Notwithstanding all the efforts made on the part of the rapporteur, who has, as always, produced a thorough piece of work in order to improve the Commission’s proposal – and I have a great deal of respect for that – I am only able to lend my support to some of her conclusions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of giving preferential treatment to exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has now been with us for nearly 30 years and has been the subject of regular oral and written questions and debates in the European Parliament. Most recently, in a debate in November 2003 we reaffirmed that a solution finally needed to be found in order to bring Israel's repeated violations of international law to an end. Because of its practice of labelling products from the occupied territories as ‘Made in Israel’, Israel is not only violating the provisions on the territorial scope of the agreement, notably Article 83, the rules on origin and the provisions on cooperation and mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters, but in doing so it is continuing to display its total contempt for international agreements and for international law. The problem is, however, now more pressing than ever before. The European Union is planning to include Israel in the preferential treatment system of pan-European accumulation, which in this case means making corresponding changes to the EC-Israel Association Agreement. If that were to happen without the illegal application of the rules on origin for settlement products being corrected, it would imply de facto 
acceptance of such illegal application. The European Union would accordingly be permanently depriving itself of the right finally to insist on legal application of the rules for preferential treatment of exports. The preferential treatment of export products from the occupied territories is, however, not only illegal and in breach of international law, it also means that the Member States continue to be faced with the thorny problem of controls and of achieving some degree of uniform treatment. Although the Commission has attempted to find a remedy, the problem has so far not been solved at all. The Commission has quite rightly informed the Israeli authorities that measures must be taken promptly to halt this illegal practice. Before there can be any further talk about amending the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I would like to call upon the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to resolve this situation before the end of its term of office. This is a very important issue, Commissioner, because it needs to go hand in hand with the amendment of the Association Agreement. The Commission should consult Parliament on this and thus prevent a situation arising, through inaction and a lack of political will, in which illegality is de facto
 legalised.

 Mr President, Mr Frattini, Commissioner Patten, I was one of those who, like Mr Morillon, warned of what could happen after such a war. I wish I had been wrong in my predictions, and take no pleasure in having been proved right. This is not about establishing who was right, who was to blame, or anything else of the sort, but about finding a way to resolve this situation. Most of us, I believe, take the view that an international solution is the only way out, but that requires international legitimacy, and that must first be established. It is because of the absence of such legitimacy in the past that the UN and the occupying powers must determine who does what, when, and where, and must clearly mark out their areas of responsibility. I agree with you entirely, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqis themselves must be involved at the earliest possible stage if, instead of concentrating on security and waiting until it is established, we consider as a whole the reconstruction measures that will be necessary – by which I mean the process of democratisation, the re-establishment of government, the creation of order, and of course the safety of all the people in Iraq, along with the rebuilding of infrastructure such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as hospitals and schools. The sooner the people of Iraq themselves take on responsibility for the rebuilding of their country – its political system and democracy, not forgetting of course the technological, social and cultural dimension – the sooner we can expect the situation to return to normal. If they are to do that, I believe, they will have to have a definite prospect of taking their destiny into their own hands in the very near future; that is why we have to set very tight deadlines in the expectation that a constituent assembly will be elected in Iraq, perhaps by the end of this year, giving the Iraqis a sense of working together with us on these matters. I think that if international legitimacy is established and the Iraqis are enabled to share responsibility for what happens to them, we in the European Union will be able, by means of common action, to make what is in fact an important contribution; today’s debate has shown that the great political and national differences of the past are no more, and that we all agree, in principle, on the same objective, that of seeing this country rebuilt.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to start with, I could not reply to you in a language other than that which we spoke when we were at school together fifty years ago. First of all, I want to thank you and warmly congratulate you for the particularly successful presidency which the Greek Government has brought to a close. As you have heard from the honourable Members' interventions – and the interventions which do not come from the same political family are more valuable – there is generally a feeling that the Greek Presidency was a great success. Nonetheless, I do not want to refer to the issues already raised, but to another issue: during the Greek Presidency, what you euphemistically refer to as the 'Iraqi crisis' took place. I think that the Greek Presidency took the best possible reaction to the division which the European Union underwent in relation to this issue in convening the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels on 17 February 2003 and with the outcome of that Council. The Greek Presidency is not to blame for the fact that some of the participants did not honour their own signatures before the week was out. I shall continue in German, the language of the country which I represent here in the European Parliament, knowing also that you will not therefore need to wear headphones.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is only a few weeks since the USA unilaterally decided to attack Iraq. Acting without a UN mandate, the United States began a war of aggression in a flagrant breach of international law. To be precise, it was not the USA alone that initiated the war: a whole string of allies, some of whom acted openly, but others secretly, also joined together in the ‘coalition of the willing’, or perhaps we should say ‘coalition of the compliant’. In addition to the self-appointed occupying powers – the United States, United Kingdom and Poland – the ranks of the coalition of the willing also included such major military powers as Palau, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and the Kingdom of Tonga. The aim of this war of aggression was, acting in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. There is no legal basis in international law for the attacking forces' additional objective of overthrowing the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein, nor is there any such provision in the Charter of the United Nations. Nor do I believe that it should be the role of the international community to remove dictators throughout the world by means of warfare. It also leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste to consider that Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was willing to send umpteen thousand British soldiers into Iraq to hunt down one dictator, while the same Jack Straw, when he was Britain's Home Secretary, decided to release another dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and thereby thus allow him to escape from the clutches of British justice. (Applause)
 The USA's unilateral war against Iraq achieved its objective of removing Saddam Hussein's regime. However, the war also resulted in appalling collateral damage: the first immediate victim was the United Nations Organisation and international law, the second was the unity of the European Union and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the third was NATO, which also received its share of ideological cluster bombs. The new doctrine of preventive war, launched by the chief ideologist, Richard Perle, the Lord of Darkness, has also shaken the foundations of NATO. Among the questions that remain to be answered, Mr President and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are when this war will end and when the end of the war will be declared. So, firstly, what is the European Union doing to ensure that end to the war is declared? Secondly, where are the weapons of mass destruction on account of which the war was declared? If the Americans are not prepared to tell us what the position on weapons of mass destruction is, then we in Europe should at least tackle them and demand a statement. (Applause

 Mr President, voting against the accession of a country for which I have particularly great respect involved a difficult decision, but it was one that I took for myself alone, without attempting to influence my group, nor allowing myself to be influenced by them. I cannot give my vote to a candidate country that, by providing combatant troops, is participating actively in an illegal, immoral and sordid war in Iraq, thereby not hesitating to break international law, and sharing in the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians. Poland is on the wrong track; its government certainly is, and in that they are not alone. The Polish people, too, preferred to follow the American Secretary for War rather than the Polish Pope. The Poles are more proud of their special unit, GROM, than they are of their Catholic bishops, who are campaigning for peace. In doing so, they are excluding themselves from the community of values that is the EU. I hope that they will soon come back. Today, after mature consideration and in complete accord with my conscience, I have voted ‘no’.

 Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has decided – as Mr Gasòliba i Böhm mentioned earlier – to ask for questions on Cuba to be put orally, so that we can discuss with the Council and the Commission the problems in that country, and to enable us, in an appropriate setting, to address the arguments in depth and come to our conclusions. Mr President, a majority in my group have therefore already expressed their objection to a topical and urgent debate, as we believe the situation in Cuba to be so grave and so important that three-minute debates are not an appropriate place for taking decisions on the subject. Mr President, I am familiar with your statement on the recent arrests in Cuba, and also with the Council's condemnation of Cuba's actions. This is one reason why we believed that this issue should be dealt with in this context rather than in a topical and urgent debate. Your response to the present situation was indeed the right one. I want to ask whether we will actually have this oral question session.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first may I thank the Greek Presidency for all its efforts and its successful actions, which had two objectives: to avoid war and to present the European Union with a united front and a united policy. My sincere congratulations to you, Mr President-in-Office, on your success, your major success in leading the European Union to agreement on a common position in Brussels on 17 February. It is not the presidency’s fault that, five days later, the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar or Anzar, as his friend Mr Bush likes to call him, broke this agreement and moved away from the common position of the European Union in order to go off to the American president’s ranch and help prepare the proposal for a Security Council resolution to declare war on Iraq.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have just been listening carefully to the President-in-Office of the Council setting out what the extraordinary summit on the 17th is intended to do. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think it would be a very good thing if we really could find a common position on the points you have set out. They are also the essential points of the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 30 January, with which you are no doubt well acquainted. I would like to take a close look at these four points. The removal of all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq is not at issue. That, I believe, is something we can all agree on, as, no doubt, we do on support for UNMOVAC and IAEA, that is to say, for the inspectors' attempts to bring all this about in Iraq. Where we will have difficulties, and where it is important that we be clear in our own minds, is with the maintenance of the UN's primacy. That international organisation is in charge of the process and must remain so; it alone is capable of endowing with legitimacy whatever measures will turn out to be necessary in this case. We also have to make clear our opposition to unilateral courses of action and, most certainly, our opposition to a preventive war. The final point that needs to be made is that we must try everything that occurs to us as individuals and groups as a means of averting this war and finding a peaceful solution. There are many possibilities for this. The latest proposals put forward in Europe point in this direction. There is one point I would like to address and one prefatory remark I would like to make in order to make Mr Poettering's speech comprehensible. This House is perhaps not aware that we had elections in Germany on 22 September last year. They were won by Gerhard Schröder and not by Mr Stoiber. That is something with which Mr Poettering cannot yet come to terms, and he believes that his speeches in this Parliament will bring about Mr Schröder's downfall in Germany. He can carry on believing that, but I do not believe that this House is particularly interested. We have quite different problems with which we should be getting to grips. One of those problems is that with the candidate countries. I think we have to make abundantly clear to the future members of the European Union the importance of the principle of solidarity, which is in every respect equal to the Copenhagen criteria and all the other technocratic criteria by which – so to speak – their readiness for accession was measured. I do not find it acceptable for these states, at this point in time, to make affirmations of solidarity, although I too welcome solidarity with the United States of America and have nothing against it. What is of primary importance, though, is solidarity with the European Union, which is to accept them as Member States and has made massive efforts in order to do so. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great deal is being said at them moment about Europe being divided. I believe that never has Europe been so united at the level of its peoples as it is today in rejecting this war in Iraq. Opinion in all the Member States and in the candidate countries is between 80% and 90% opposed to war. (Applause)
 And I wonder how Mr Poettering, whom I have known for twenty years now, can make himself so remote from the opinions of his own people. (Applause)

 Mr President, as we are all aware, dormant explosive devices, landmines and cluster bombs are among the weapons that can cause especially cruel injuries and mutilations. Those of us who have been to countries in conflict will know the mutilations and wounds with which one is confronted there. I myself became familiar with these sights in Central America. Parliament has, in various resolutions, insisted on the implementation of the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which banned the use of landmines. It is with reference to this that I want to praise the Commission for the excellent work it has done, not only in the field of mine clearance, but also in educating people as to why landmines have to be banned. Work is progressing at present on preparations for the next conference on the revision of the Ottawa Convention, which is to be held this September in Bangkok, by which time I very much hope that those European states that have not yet ratified the Ottawa Convention will have made good their omission. I look forward to hearing what the President-in-Office of the Council will have to say in response to this question. I think he might well be about to bring Parliament good news from Greece. The worldwide campaign against landmines has already made great progress. Considerable efforts are currently being made to get belligerent parties other than states to sign up to the Ottawa Convention. This work is being undertaken by a non-governmental organisation – 'Appell de Genève' – and I believe that we can rejoice that such work is being done by non-governmental organisations when state bodies cannot carry it out. In Somalia, for example, 15 organisations and belligerent parties, none of them part of any state apparatus, have signed the Convention. Another problem of a particularly shattering nature comes in the form of cluster bombs, whose victims include innocent civilians; the injuries these bombs inflict are so horrific and their effects so indiscriminate, that they should be prohibited outright. Previous speakers have described this, and I wish to touch on it only very briefly. You are all familiar with the descriptions of the horrendous injuries resulting from the deployment of cluster bombs. The particularly dreadful thing about it is that the splinters from the cluster bombs that remain in the human body are almost never capable of being removed. Not only are the effects of these bombs indiscriminate in that they can strike civilians as much as soldiers, but they are also imprecise in the area they affect, which amounts to something like 350 football fields every time a cluster bomb is dropped. This makes the precision bombing of military targets impossible, so that there is an increased risk of innocent people being injured. Finally, these bombs also vary in their effect over time, since, if they do not explode, they can remain live for years to come. It was in December 2001 that Parliament last recalled the 1980 UN agreement on certain conventional weapons and demanded an immediate moratorium on the use of cluster bombs. A moratorium can clearly only be the second best solution until such time as a ban on these inhuman weapons becomes enforceable, but I believe that imposing a moratorium in the first instance is the pragmatic way to go about things. It is here that the European Union could, by its actions, give a very good example.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Salafranca. There were reasons for this Agreement's problem-free progress through the committee and the unanimous support it received in it, for we worked together very well, not only on this Agreement but generally, and Chile's concerns have found a worthy rapporteur in the person of Mr Salafranca. As has already been mentioned, this is an Agreement with a large number of objectives, a complete Agreement intended to cover a great deal and to bring us closer together. The Commissioner has stated that, even while the Agreement was being worked out, bilateral trade increased by 28%, and, whilst I believe that there is room for further increases and greater cooperation, I would like to point out that the actual reason Chile deserves this special new Agreement is that it currently represents an atoll of stability in Latin America, which is so turbulent economically, politically and in other ways. It is in our interests to maintain this stability and help to make it even more secure. My principal interest is in the political dimension, and there are two points I would like to address at this point. The first, the ratification of the treaty on the International Criminal Court, initially appeared to be something of a problem but has been resolved by cooperation with the Chilean embassy in Brussels and by the government's assurances. We attach great importance to Chile's ratification of this treaty. We are aware of the constitutional difficulties that exist at present, but, having satisfied ourselves that the government is working on it, we have hope of it being ratified soon. The second point is that Chile is currently a member of the Security Council. In these very difficult times, it will be very important that Chile should, in consultation and coordination with the relevant Member States of the European Union, help to achieve a peaceful solution to the present conflict.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will begin with a quotation, one which sums up like no other statement our position on the war against Iraq: ‘A preventive war is an act of aggression, and cannot be described as a just war in self-defence. For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack, but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent. Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law's prohibition of force, promote political instability and, in the final analysis, shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states.’ And elsewhere in the same statement: ‘Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law.’ These quotations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued, on 20 January of this year, by the Conference of German Bishops. As my Christian Democrat opposite number has not made reference to the Conference of Catholic Bishops, I have to do so, and do not think that these statements require anything to be added to them. All the time I have known you, Mr Solana, I have regarded you as a great optimist, so when you say, as you have done today, that the political situation is bad, then the political situation is very bad. Donald Rumsfeld, the American minister for war, spoke of ‘old Europe’. All of us who have spoken here today have declared that we belong to this old Europe, and that would not be cause for any further excitement on our part, had he not drawn the distinction between us and the ‘new Europe’ – those whose opinions are identical with Mr Rumsfeld's and who think along the same lines as he does. President Kwasniewski of Poland said in an interview last week, ‘If it is President Bush's vision, it is mine!’ The Polish President is of course entitled to as narrow a field of vision as he may choose, but there is no doubt that the Polish government – like all the governments of the other candidate countries – is under an obligation to act in solidarity with the European Union, to which they want to belong. The candidate countries have decided of their own free will to belong to the European Union, and we wish to welcome them, but, when it comes to issues of war and peace, preventive warfare and the setting-aside of international law, we expect them to be solidly alongside us.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am sure you would understand me perfectly if I spoke in German but, in honour of the Greek Presidency, I shall torment the interpreters with my Greek. Mr President-in-Office, I fully endorse your presentation of the situation in Afghanistan. I think we all feel a reserved satisfaction; we all see the continuing shortcomings in Afghanistan and we all know what has to be done over coming years. You yourself referred to the lack of security, the hostilities and the production and trafficking of narcotics, as did the Commissioner, and I think that the House is in full agreement with the timetable you suggest for elections in Afghanistan and improving the situation in general. There is no need for me to repeat what we are all agreed on. I should like to highlight two points which should not be left out of any discussion of Afghanistan. One is the terrible events which have taken place in the name of the fight against terrorism. Let there be no misunderstanding: I am behind the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan or anywhere else 100%. The warlords and the Taliban were never our allies. It was not the European Union that trained, armed and helped the Taliban through Pakistan. It was not us who created the forces we are now fighting against. But the fight against terrorism, the fight against violations of human rights and terrorism against women, the fight for democracy and the rule of law is only a credible fight if it is fought within a framework of respect for human rights and respect for the right to life of people who may be terrorists or criminals. I should like to add to today’s debate on Afghanistan by mentioning two very dark sides to this war. First, the horrendous allegations about the slaughter in Mazar-I-Sharif. I think the UN has an obligation both to investigate and examine these allegations closely and to make known and publish the results of their enquiries. And secondly, we should be ashamed about the fate of prisoners in Guantanamo and other detention camps run by the American military for members of the Taliban who have been arrested and people who have been imprisoned and are being called Taliban. The European Union should do something about this, it is a disgrace.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to preface my observations with an expression of my own gratitude and that of my group, for this debate, and also for all the work of reporting on enlargement and of preparation for it, which I address to the Commission among others. To say this, Commissioner, is not just to pay lip-service, for we have indeed received all the information we needed whenever we needed it. We have carried on the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and I also want to thank that committee's chairman, not only for his report but also for all the cooperation that was involved. It is my belief that all groups and all the political forces on the committee did their best to accompany this process in a critical frame of mind and have helped to make it, and enlargement, a success. I have two specific points that I wish to address in addition to what my fellow-Members have said about the individual countries and also about the general aspect, which was apposite and intelligent. These have to do with two very real problems. My first point has to do with Cyprus, specifically with the UN Secretary-General's proposal on the subject, which has been welcomed by all sides. There is, however, one item in Annex IX that could lead to misunderstandings; I refer to the proposals relating to Article 1(1) on a referendum of the citizens in this divided country when the Basic Agreement is adopted. The questions in this referendum are to be answered with ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They deal firstly with the new structure of the state and then with Cyprus' accession to the European Union. It is my belief that the European Union ought, quite independently of this – I am glad that I can already expect something of you, Commissioner – to decide this question in accordance with the Helsinki accords, and Cyprus should have its say on the subject. The second issue has to do with Turkey. I would like to remind you that we are not debating Turkey today, but are engaged in the debate on enlargement, and, although Turkey has had candidate status since 1999, it is not one of the countries expecting to accede in the immediate future. The Copenhagen political criteria have still not been fulfilled, despite Turkey's great efforts in that direction, the great successes it has had and the great progress it has made. I therefore see no reason to talk in terms of this or that date. Let me tell you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: fixing a date is not an issue, at any rate not for us!

 Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are issues relating to the current situation in Iraq which are uncontentious, which we all share and where we have a broad consensus. The first is that Iraq must comply with all the UN Security Council's resolutions in full and without any ifs, buts or maybes. I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for saying that it is not only Iraq which should do so, but we are talking about Iraq here today. Secondly, we all agree that the weapons inspectors must return to Iraq and that they must have unfettered access to be able to do their job properly. In particular, they must search for, and then destroy, weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems. I am most grateful to you, Commissioner, for making a further point on this consensus, and I am especially gratified that you did so by pointing out that the response to this situation, to the problem of Iraq, should be sought multilaterally and through the United Nations framework. That is the opportunity for us genuinely to resolve this problem once and for all. There are other issues where we do not have this consensus. They include, for example, the question whether the weapons inspectors who now have a mandate to go to Iraq must wait until the Security Council adopts a new resolution. I think that a definition of their mandate by the UN Secretary-General would suffice. If it is indeed the case that a major threat emanates from Iraq, then it is logical, after all, to ensure that these inspectors go to Iraq as soon as possible. At the same time, the UN Secretary-General must look at the issue of the embargo. While the inspectors are searching for weapons in Iraq, conditions must be re-established for the embargo to be abolished entirely, and for the embargo to be ended. I think this is axiomatic, but I would like to reiterate and underline this point here once again. While the weapons inspectors are searching for weapons in Iraq, the bombing campaign by the US and the United Kingdom, which is not based on any UN resolution, cannot continue. It should be suspended – I am phrasing this carefully – until we have the inspectors' report. Finally, the UN should prepare a roadmap for the destruction of weapons and for the inspections, and a roadmap for the embargo and for Iraq's reintegration into the international community. This would be an important step which could be initiated by the UN. In the context of the UN, let me say that if we opt for the UN, we cannot have a UN à la carte. In other words, we cannot comply with the resolutions which suit us and ignore the ones that do not! We must be very clear about this, and I am in favour of our respecting and implementing all the UN resolutions accordingly. (Applause)

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty on the International Criminal Court is an indispensable instrument to assert international law. The founding of this Criminal Court is a European Union project and at the same time it symbolises our system of values. That is why this House regards the Treaty as an integral part of the Copenhagen political criteria. The principle behind this Treaty is plain and simple. Anyone who has committed genocide or war crimes, anyone who is guilty of crimes against humanity should not go unpunished. That is why it is completely incomprehensible that the demand should be made that not all criminals should go before the court, but that some of them, regardless of the seriousness of their crime and solely on the basis of owning a particular document, should be excluded from its jurisdiction. This demand made by the Bush administration would stand in total contradiction to the aim and purpose of the International Criminal Court. It is not only absurd but also unacceptable, and for two reasons. It is firstly unacceptable because exempting all of the nationals of a State would mean that the jurisdiction could only be selective and would therefore take the principle of the universality of justice to absurd lengths. Secondly it is unacceptable because it views all of the nationals of one particular State as potential war criminals. I oppose this generalised anti-Americanism in the strongest possible terms. Some States – so far 12 in number – have succumbed to the huge pressure exerted on them by the United States of America and signed a bilateral agreement with the USA. I deeply regret this and think that it will have consequences for our relations with these States. In any case, tomorrow, in a joint motion tabled by four groups – and it is also exceptional, Madam President, that a joint motion should be tabled in this Parliament – the European Parliament will adopt a very clear position on this. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of making a personal comment, because I have worked with you for a very long time and because I have always very much appreciated the open and honest way in which you have expressed your views. It seems to me that in the course of the ten-metre journey from here to where you are sitting now you have been struck dumb. You have not told us what happened in Elsinore, but instead you repeated what the Spanish Presidency achieved in this area in May. I suppose that is better than nothing. I would like to comment on Commissioner Patten's two questions. I can assure you, Mr Patten, that we are all in favour of observing UN resolutions. However, the United Nations is not an organisation where you can pick and choose – we have to comply with the United Nations Charter and we also have to comply with international law. The United Nations Charter stipulates the cases in which military means are possible and permissible, and the procedure is also laid down. The UN Charter does not make any provision for a pre-emptive war or for a war to remove an undesirable government, and we cannot ignore that. Anyone who wages such a war in spite of this is himself an aggressor and is himself in breach of international law. The second question was about the broad coalition. On that point, I can assure you that that should in fact be the European Union's sole objective. But we are not the ones who have split the broad coalition; no, it has been undermined by American unilateralism. My question to you is: how can we re-establish this unity, this broad coalition? (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, when we endeavoured to come up with a joint motion for a resolution yesterday, we took all the issues you have touched upon today into account. There was a really broad consensus on the points we discussed, and I do not just mean humanitarian issues and reconstruction in Afghanistan, but also other political issues. I would like to discuss that here, but I would like to specifically mention that my colleague Mrs Gröner will be dealing with the position of women in Afghanistan, which is a very special issue. Our motion for a joint resolution starts with a clear condemnation of terrorism, stating that Afghanistan's historical problems also contributed to the need for intervention of this kind. I do not want to say any more about that intervention. It was very broadly-based and it at least attracted support and could be justified. We believe that the role of the United Nations – and I am now returning to the same discussion that we had earlier – is not being given sufficient weight at present. The United Nations needs to decide not only about peacekeeping measures, but also about the future of this intervention. The United Nations also needs to define the objectives of this intervention, the time required for it, and it should also decide when this intervention should come to an end. We believe that the moral justification we had for this intervention should also apply to the treatment of prisoners from this war, either in Afghanistan itself or outside Afghanistan, in Guantanamo. These prisoners deserve to be treated in accordance with international law and the international conventions. We believe that the international community bears an important responsibility for investigating and establishing the position as regards the human rights violations in northern Afghanistan that have been mentioned, and in particular those in the Dasht-e-Leile region which have been reported by the UN. In reply to Mr Wurtz, who mentioned this point just now, I would say that we in this House should make a very clear request for the United Nations to carry out an investigation and to bring those guilty to justice once they have been tracked down. Mr Wurtz, I regret that your group feels unable to sign this motion for a resolution, but you can at least vote for it.

 Mr President, a delegation from the democratically elected parliament of Taiwan visited us here in Strasbourg yesterday at the invitation of Members of the European Parliament. You, Mr President, did this delegation the honour of welcoming them and speaking with them. However, during this visit something happened of which I, and I believe several colleagues here, are ashamed. Last night our guests had to leave in haste because the visa that they had been granted by the French authorities was only valid for 24 hours. All attempts by Members of this House to have this visa extended or to have a visa issued for a longer period failed in the face of the obstinacy of the French authorities. I have two questions for you, Mr President. Firstly, do you consider this refusal to grant a visa for – and this is my suspicion – purely political reasons to be compatible with the values of the European Union, which deems freedom, including the freedom of movement of all people, to be a fundamental right? Secondly, do you, like me and other members of this House, consider this incident to constitute a serious obstacle to the proper functioning of the European Parliament in Strasbourg? If so, what action are you minded to take? (Applause)

 Mr President, in negotiations, we accepted the text in its original version. We recognised the undoubted error of not calling a state by its name, and so the correction was made to its present form, ‘The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’, which is the state's official name. We think Parliament would only be making itself ridiculous if it were, on the grounds of particular sentiments or political tendencies, to call a state by a name other than that which belongs to it.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I intend to confine my comments to the conflict between India and Pakistan. Mr President-in-Office, you rightly noted in your speech that this conflict threatens to destabilise and endanger the whole region. Concern about this immense danger has brought all of us responsible for foreign policy in nearly all the groups to a common position, as expressed in the resolution on Seville. We call in this resolution for both countries to make every possible effort to deescalate the situation and join in constructive dialogue in a bid to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Both sides clearly have a responsibility to defuse the conflict, which is why I welcome the measures taken over the past few days by India, which has decided to lift the ban on Pakistani aeroplanes using Indian airspace, appoint a high commissioner for Islamabad and order its warships back to port. We also expect President Musharaf to continue and step up his efforts to stop the infiltration of terrorists via the line of control in Kashmir. If he honours the promises made in his speech on 12 January this year, then a huge step will have been made towards resolving the conflict. I was in Kashmir a few weeks ago and went to an Indian post 3 400 metres up on the line of control, so I know what I am talking about. The war against terrorism can in fact only be effectively waged on the Pakistani side. Pakistan is responsible not just for catching terrorists before they reach the border, but also for meting out appropriate punishment and taking them out of circulation. One last point which plays a very important part in the whole dispute is the need to strengthen democracy. India is a democracy and we hope that Pakistan will be too if free elections are held in the autumn and put a democratic government in power.

 Mr President, we find ourselves faced with the worst situation in the region since the 1967 and 1973 wars. Israel is demonstrating its total contempt for the resolutions of the UN Security Council, for international law, for international treaties and for international conventions. We must share the blame for massacres, crimes against humanity, and the repression and daily humiliation of a whole people if we remain silent and seek a balance between the oppressor and the oppressed. There can be no such balance. What can we do? A great deal, I believe. For example, an embargo on arms to Israel, recalling our ambassadors to the European Union's capitals, freezing all contacts with senior figures in Israel's Government, and lastly suspending the Association Agreement. Commissioner, I am now addressing you as the Commission's representative here, but these words are really meant for Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, for whom I have enormous respect both personally and for what he has achieved. However, I simply do not understand his statements over the last few days. Let me quote:

Mr President, I want to tell Mr Poettering that I am in absolute agreement with the proposal he has made. I do think that, if we want to have a proper debate on Chechnya, we must not have it as a matter of urgency with one or two minutes available, but in the context of a statement on this issue by the Council and the Commission, so we could have a serious discussion about it. Apart from that, I do not wish to respond to the constant attacks by Mr Dupuis and his crowd, such as, for example, Mr Pannella and the rest of them.

Mr President, High Representative, I too want to welcome the Commissioner, who will shortly be returning to the Chamber. I wish to start by joining with Mr Poettering in what he said on behalf of his group, and also, on behalf of our group, express our thanks for the success of the policy on the Macedonian issue which the High Representative and the Commissioner conducted last summer. The press is, unfortunately, always full of the things that are not going well in Europe, but when a policy is successful, it is virtually ignored. I want to focus my remarks on the Middle East. I am dismayed by the figures the Commission has published on the destruction recently meted out to projects funded by the European Union. The point here is not the fact that something is being destroyed, but rather the reason why it is being destroyed. The Israeli government is attempting to wreck whatever might become the infrastructure of a future Palestinian state, and that is something we cannot accept. You were saying today, Mr Solana, that what is going on there is not a peace process. I agree with you wholeheartedly. I have been saying in this House for a year and a half that we should no longer use the word ‘peace process’. It is a low-intensity war, but a war all the same, and our task is to put a stop to it and attempt to restart what will become a peace process. We are, though, still a long way from doing that. Mr Solana, I fully support your statement that the EU must carry on, for we have no alternative. As has repeatedly been said, though, Israel does not want us as mediators. Perhaps you will again be accepted and welcomed there, with an opportunity we are rarely given to present our policies and our proposals. Are we then to finance projects only to see the Israeli government's tanks destroy them? I also consider the recognition of a Palestinian state to be very important, indeed, as Mr Poettering has said, the only possibility. A President has been elected for this Palestinian state, and that is something Mr Sharon cannot ignore any more than we can. He is the only person we can negotiate with. I do not believe there are many other potential partners in dialogue on the Palestinian side. I regret, Mr Solana, my inability to share even in your modest optimism. For one and a half years, we have been looking on while two utterly unequal opponents wage war on each other. We look on while Israeli tanks destroy Palestinian homes and kill Palestinian civilians and we also watch as Palestinians kill themselves and take equally innocent Israeli citizens with them. It goes without saying that we condemn all violence and every terrorist act without ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’. Where, though, does it get us? We achieve no progress by it, and so, Mr Solana, we and the Commission as well, have to think in terms of using the powers we have by reason of the association agreement with Israel, even to the extent of suspending it. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary of State, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has, since the Cologne Extraordinary Summit in June 1999, possessed a European security and defence identity which, for the first time, is truly worthy of the designation ‘common’. We have achieved great steps forward in this area, which will allow us to use the Rapid Reaction Force, which will be ready for action from 2003 onwards, to independently carry out what are termed the Petersberg tasks, at least on our own continent and in any case with an appropriate UN mandate. Mr President-in-Office, I would like to add a brief observation to your statements and make a major request of the Spanish Presidency. Taking the observation first, you have described the Rapid Reaction Force as being also an instrument against terrorism in the European Union. I would say that, in our democratic states, the combating of terrorism is primarily a task for the internal forces of law and order and the justice authorities. Should military actions also become necessary, as they did after 11 September, what we call the principle of the rule of law nevertheless remains untouched. My request to the Spanish Presidency is that, where military operations are mounted under the sole leadership of the European Union, there must be the possibility of falling back on the material resources of NATO, especially in transport and reconnaissance capacities, and also, to some extent, in the command structures. It is truly astonishing that the agreement we need between the EU and NATO has, through Turkey's resistance, not yet come about. The proposal that Great Britain and the United States, without the EU's mandate, presented at the Laeken Summit, is unsuitable and unacceptable. So I ask that the Spanish Presidency should see to it that we get an agreement with NATO, so that our security and defence policy may be secured. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the rapporteur has done a very good piece of work with this report and we can be pleased that after so many years of negotiations Egypt has at last agreed with us to sign this report. A short time ago we voted for a deferral of this report and I think anyone who really wants to address the question of human rights in Egypt must vote in favour of this report. This report gives us, the European Union, the ability to take up this matter because we have this human rights clause in Article 2. Anyone who is really interested in peace in the Middle East must support this report in any case because it strengthens a country that has been fighting for peace in the Middle East for years. I cannot understand why honourable Members who voted unanimously in favour of this report a week ago in committee now have reservations. Nothing in Egypt has changed, I do not know where anything has changed that would make anybody take a different stance now than the one we took in committee. I would like to raise one final point, that is the letter that the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament has written to us. I would like to say that it is unusual to try to influence a decision in this way, an absolutely independent decision of a parliament, and for this reason I shall tomorrow be tabling an oral amendment on behalf of my group, as already arranged with the rapporteur.

 Madam President, I wish to raise a matter of a highly sensitive nature for this House and which affects the debate about enlargement. It concerns a statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry about Mr Poos’ report on the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. In that statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry makes an unfair and slanderous attack on an honourable Member who presented his report to the relevant committee. The committee accepted the report as it stood with only two votes against. I can see that parliamentarianism in Turkey has not yet reached the stage where they can understand what is in this report and what responsibility, if we can call it that, Mr Poos has taken on. It is a report of Parliament. I would therefore like to see Parliament respond to this unfair attack. Madam President, to give you just one example of the bad taste, it says here in point 1 of the statement:

Madam President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, thank you very much for your remarks here today, especially for the clear language which you, Madam President-in-Office, used and which is not always found in the Council’s statements. You actually described what the Israeli government is doing, namely murdering its opponents, whom it accuses of being terrorists, as murder. In the light of this fact I find it embarrassing and sometimes in poor taste to make reference to schoolbooks when we see that Orient House is occupied, Palestinian territory is invaded and occupied and Palestinian police stations are systematically destroyed regardless of the human casualties. Anyone who says Mr Arafat is responsible for what is going on there cannot be very well informed about politics. Everything we have tried and proposed in the past has failed, sending observers – I am glad Mr Van Orden also advocates that – all that has failed because of the Israeli government’s refusal to accept it. Even the Mitchell report, which we all support as a common point of reference, cannot be implemented because the Israeli government under Mr Sharon – who is wanted by the police in your country, Madam President-in-Office, which is why he cannot be invited to Brussels – wants to interpret the Mitchell report and determine when it will be applied. In view of this situation, I am no longer calling for greater involvement in the process. We want to be involved, but we are not accepted. What else can we do? We have a treaty with Israel and we ought to give some thought – you have also mentioned this in the past, Commissioner, where treaties have been broken – to whether we can maintain that treaty in force or whether we ought to suspend it.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, I should firstly like to express my satisfaction and also congratulate the High Representative of the CFSP and Commissioner Patten, because I think that in our attempts to resolve this conflict we are actually revealing the form which our CFSP will take. Commissioner Patten spoke of the responsibility which we have in the region. Commissioner, I should like to go a step further and say what mistakes have been made. In this specific case there are two things which, in my view, have not happened and which are nevertheless contained in Resolution 1244: firstly to disarm the KLA in Kosovo and secondly to disband the KLA in Kosovo. Neither have been done. Quite the opposite! The KLA has been given organisational structures which it did not have before. The sin also bears a name, because it was the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General – Bernard Kouchner is his name – who failed to do this. We need to state this openly here. That is why it is not enough to offer our good services for conflict resolution; we also have a duty to put right the mistakes which we have made. I welcome the fact that NATO is on standby. The disarmament of the KLA terrorists allows me to recognise them for what they are: terrorists and criminals and not rebels! These KLA terrorists must be disarmed and NATO is offering to do this. I wonder why we should now send an additional 3 000 soldiers there, under the conditions with which we are all familiar, when we could have disarmed these criminals and disbanded their organisations back in Kosovo. Under no circumstances – and here I fully agree with Mrs Pack and the other speakers – must a long-term NATO presence engender the division of the country along ethnic lines and under no circumstances must NATO entrench that split by its presence and its willingness to help. NATO must be deployed in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with a very specific mission, namely disarmament.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission. I intend to focus on foreign and security policy aspects which the European Parliament may care to recommend to the Gothenburg Council. First, I should like to thank the Swedish presidency for its initiatives in the area of conflict prevention and civil crisis management. They are a credit to the tradition of your country and they are right and proper for the European Union. I should like to encourage you, Madam President-in-Office, to bring the project which you have started to a successful conclusion in Gothenburg in the form of a strong, specific programme which can be implemented at once. One of the most difficult tasks, not just for the Council presidency, but for the European Council as a whole in Gothenburg, will be to convey to the American president just how worried and concerned we are about the new policy which he has adopted for the United States of America. We are not just extremely worried about the rocket defence system, the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the USA's attitude towards the International Criminal Tribunal; the USA's aversion to traditional cooperation with the European Union is a particularly worrying sign for anyone who sees this cooperation as instrumental when it comes to resolving huge international problems. Madam President-in-Office, my closing point concerns a very sad and dramatic situation emanating from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We were due to receive Mr Trajkovski, the president of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, here within the hour. He will not be coming – presumably because of the serious situation in his country. And we must take our share of the blame, Madam President-in-Office, for the situation in his country. We must take our share of the blame for the terrorist action of the KLA, which we have failed to disband, despite Security Council Resolution 1244, and which is now attacking this country and undermining its very existence. The European Union must do everything it can, Madam President-in-Office, to put an end to this terrorism and help this country.

 Mr President, this report makes it possible for the European Parliament to debate the ASEM process and comment on its results. This new partnership between Europe and Asia gives both sides a golden opportunity to deepen and strengthen relations, in respect not only of the economy, but also political, social and cultural matters. As early as the third ASEM Summit in Seoul political aspects such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law were successfully promoted from being the subject of a fruitful dialogue between the partners in the ASEM process to prompting relevant undertakings from leading ASEM politicians. It will come as no surprise to anyone to learn that our Parliament, which has made these values the focus of its work for years, attaches quite particular importance to these same values being respected by the Council and the Commission and to the Council and the Commission doing all they can to make these values part and parcel of the ongoing political dialogue with our Asian partners in the ASEM process. At a time when the European Union is almost talking about nothing else but enlargement, it is, I believe, very appropriate to say that this ASEM process and the circle of partners within it should also be extended to include states like India, which might also be deemed to have earned a place in this dialogue. I should like to address two points which, in my view, have wrongly become the subject of talks with and occasional protests on the part of the Chinese Embassy. Our requiring Taiwan's politicians to have visas for private visits to Europe does not amount to recognition of the Republic of Taiwan or in fact anything at all; it is the pursuance of a consistent policy which Europe has on the freedom of movement of people, consistent in particular if in the future Taiwan were also to follow in China's footsteps and become a member of the World Trade Organisation. Finally, Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to an old demand of the European Parliament: we have always said that with a region such as Taiwan, with which we in Europe have very intensive economic relations, our relations are such as to warrant a representation, that is an information office, being set up there.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I have no intention of saying anything about Nice, now that no one is listening anyway. The President of the PPE-DE Group complained bitterly earlier on that no one was listening to him. I intend to focus on the Commission's plans for foreign and security policy. There are two sides to this policy, the geographical aspect and the content. I agree for the most part with the Commission's list of countries, except on one point: there is no mention of the Middle East. We were the biggest provider of aid and support to Palestine and the region as a whole in the past and will hopefully continue to be so in the future. I am not satisfied with funding a process while others decide on its political content. We need a different role, a stronger role in the Middle East negotiations. We expect this to be understood not just as the job of the Council and the High Representative of the CFSP; we also expect an important, creative initiative on the part of the Commission. As far as the content is concerned, we need the Commission's presence to be felt in the common European security and defence policy. Our Parliament welcomed the development in this area in Mrs Lalumière's report but – and here I should like to pick up on Mr Nassauer's Marxist digression – a spirit is abroad in Europe, especially in this area: the spirit of intergovernmentalism. Parliament wants a common, not an intergovernmental European security and defence policy. The Commission is duty bound, Mr President, to reinforce the Community dimension of this policy. You want to do it by making a contribution to crisis management and conflict prevention and I think that is a good thing. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, from your speech a few minutes ago, it seems that you deserve another title: high representative for hope.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this debate today because of the concern we have for people. Some of these people are the military personnel, our troops, who are there, but we are also concerned about the civilian population, the millions who live in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo. We do not seek to establish here and now whether the war in Kosovo was justified or not. It would be inappropriate to engage in such a debate. What we must do – and I entirely agree here with the High Representative of the CFSP – is to examine with the utmost care and precision whether a link exists between the incidences of illness and the quantities of ammunition with depleted uranium which were fired during the war in Yugoslavia and Kosovo and in Bosnia too. If we intend to do that, we must pledge ourselves to certain important principles, so that we at least, as elected representatives of the peoples of Europe, can restore the credibility which NATO has forfeited through this and similar episodes. Foremost priority attaches to precise and independent tests by international experts with the aid of every possible scientific method. Secondly, we need a radical change in our information policy, and in this respect I must thank the Council, and above all the High Representative of the CFSP, for their undertaking to make all information available to Parliament. Thirdly, and finally, we must demand an immediate moratorium on all arms and ammunition of this type until we have the complete results of the tests we have commissioned, so that we can then take our decisions in a responsible manner.

Madam President, over the last few days, we have watched the dream of peace in the Middle East disintegrate. The horrifying pictures of children running for cover being killed and of civilians being fired at from tanks and helicopters give us just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both sides, Israel and Palestine, if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process as quickly as possible. That is the most important aspect at the moment, not apportioning blame and condemnation. The European Union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it. However, I am not prepared – as I have been urged on several occasions, purely in order to appear fair – to refrain from calling the events of the last few days by their proper name or from making the same demands on both sides, as if the provocation and force were divided equally between them. Or should I call on the Hamas leader Scheich Yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visiting the wailing wall on the Sabbath in order to provoke the Jews praying there? Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army to withdraw its tanks and helicopters from Israeli towns and villages and stop firing on civilian Israelis? Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army not to shoot any small Israeli children cowering behind walls and trying to take cover behind barrels? I am not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness. But I am prepared to call on my fellow members in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter-productivity, as Mrs Albright said, in order to gloss things over, purely to appear fair towards both sides. In this respect, I am most grateful for the clear statement made by my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk.

 Madam President, yesterday we decided – and this is also recorded in the Minutes – to hold a debate on Thursday on developments in the Middle East. However, we did not set a deadline for tabling motions for resolutions. I would request that we set such a deadline, both for the actual motions – this could be today at 6 p.m. – and for amendments, where we should try to set the deadline for as late as possible tomorrow, so that we can take into account any results from the meeting between Ehud Barak and Yassir Arafat tomorrow in Paris. I would ask that we set this deadline and that it be as late as possible.

Mr President, Commissioner, I only have two minutes and must dispense with references to honeymoons. Nonetheless, I should like to thank the general rapporteur, Elmar Brok, who is also chairman of the committee, for the farsightedness and astonishing sensitivity with which he has conducted the debate, including and most importantly, in committee. As a result, we can now take up a coherent position for the European Parliament which is supported by all political groups. After such a comprehensive debate, I should just like to address and highlight two questions, which now have no or the wrong meaning in the public eye. The first is the question of the reforms needed in the European Union itself. As a result of the Intergovernmental Conference, the conditions needed in order for the European Union to be able to enlarge will be in place. All too often we stand with raised finger pointing in the direction of the candidates and lecture them on their obligations, when what we should do is point in our own direction and understand once and for all that, when it comes to fulfilling obligations, our turn comes well before theirs. The second point concerns the setting of dates. I am resolutely in favour of setting one date, i.e. the date by which the European Union will have completed its reforms and will therefore be ready to receive new members. To set a total of a further twelve dates would, in my view, be irresponsible, for the reasons which numerous speakers have cited here today, and would increase the candidates’ frustration rather than motivating them.

 Mr President, on 15 April this year, following a full debate with the Council and the Commission, we adopted a resolution that was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of this House. In that resolution we called on the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to protect the life and health of the Iraqi people and to put an end to its suffering. We called for the embargo on food and medicines to be lifted, because it hits the Iraqi people and not Saddam Hussein. We called for an immediate stop to the bombing the USA and the United Kingdom is engaged on without a mandate from the UN Security Council, because again this hits and punishes not the culprits but the victims in Iraq. At the beginning of that resolution we of course confirmed and underlined the Iraqi Government’s obligation to accept and encourage the United Nations’ controls with a view to the destruction of ABC weapons and to trace the disappeared Kuwaiti citizens. With today’s debate and this new resolution we are seeking to achieve three further objectives. First, we want to address not just the Council and the Commission but also the United Nations Security Council. Secondly, we propose that our Parliament should take the initiative in sending a fact-finding mission on the ground. Thirdly, we reiterate the need for the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the Red Cross to ensure that the most deprived and vulnerable people in Iraq can benefit from the oil for food programme.

 Mr President, we agreed a joint motion for a resolution, on which five groups collaborated. Once the document was finished, a sixth group joined in. I think it is contrary to our Rules of Procedure for a group to join in signing this motion without asking the others. My group regards that as a breach of our Rules of Procedure and I would ask you, Mr President, to examine this matter. Given that we collaborated on it, we will in fact vote for this resolution, yet I would ask you to ensure that the sixth group’s signature is deleted from this motion for a resolution.

 Mr President, the same applies here as to the one I just spoke about. I insist that you have this checked because it was just during this part-session that a member of our group wanted to add his signature to a motion for a resolution by other groups but first had to obtain written authorisation from the other groups. We cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week. So I would ask you to investigate this matter and inform us of the results. For the rest, we support this resolution because we helped draft it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago there was a coup in Fiji. Hostages were taken in the coup, and the press and politicians the world over have taken a stance on this. Now it is over: negotiations have been held, the hostages have been freed and the coup has been over for some time. I wonder what further urgent comments the European Parliament should now have to make on this. In my view this contravenes Rule 50 and Annex III of our Rules of Procedure. That is why we are requesting the deletion of this item from the list of topical and urgent subjects.

 Madam President, once again it is not the content of a motion for a resolution that is at issue here but our Rules of Procedure. In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy we have been trying to ensure – and I appeal to all those colleagues who have been involved in this initiative – that important issues of this kind are not dealt with in the topical and urgent debate; instead we want to ensure that proper treatment is reserved for them in the form of a committee procedure, an oral question or a Council statement. Here the issue is Tibet. We know how important this is. In 1992 I personally produced a report on Tibet. A motion reflecting the report's conclusions was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament. On 15 April here in this House we unanimously adopted a resolution on Tibet, and now we are repeating what we said on 15 April, perhaps with one or two minor additions. I do not believe that Parliament's reputation is enhanced by our constantly debating the same subjects. That is why we are requesting that this item be withdrawn.
Sakellariou (PSE

 Madam President, I will not tire of appealing to the consciences of my colleagues. We, and other Members, in particular the coordinators of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have established that the matters which we select for consideration in the topical and urgent debate are not always very appropriate. This also applies here, to Iraq. Three months ago, at the April plenary part-session, we adopted a resolution in which we say everything that it is possible for us to say about Iraq. All the issues are covered. I have carefully read the new motions for resolutions which have been tabled, but they do not contain anything new. Nevertheless, this is to be included as a topical and urgent motion because one group, which has travelled to Iraq of its own accord, now has to submit this motion for a resolution. I think that this would be wrong and irresponsible of Parliament, and that is why we are asking for this item to be withdrawn.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the excellent work of our rapporteur, Catherine Lalumière, we are now able to present Parliament’s position in the run-up to the European Council in Feira. She has succeeded in describing a really accurate and balanced position with which a large majority of the political forces here in Parliament can identify. Thank you, Catherine Lalumière. The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things. First, that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities. So far, we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts. If we want to avoid war, we need to give ourselves this capability. I am delighted that you, Commissioner Patten, take this same view and look forward to hearing your proposals, the Commission’s proposals. Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action. Thirdly: we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict. In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours. These realisations have resulted in the European Union’s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy. Today’s debate is the European Parliament’s contribution to these efforts on the part of the European Union as a whole.

Madam President, there are two reasons as to why we are not debating the Venezuela issue. Firstly, there is the respect we have for our own Rules of Procedure. We are no longer in earnest about these debates on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, nor is our attitude to be taken seriously. We decided in the AFET committee that we would adhere strictly to Rule 50 and Annex 3 of our Rules of Procedure, according to which an issue of this kind, i.e. an event that happened months ago, can no longer be dealt with as an urgent procedure, even if it is, of course, very important.  Secondly, demands are made in this motion that have been neither considered nor discussed in budgetary terms. Hence we are calling for this issue to be withdrawn and replaced by an issue that is genuinely urgent and highly topical, i.e. the attempted coup in Paraguay and the arrest of the former rebel General Oviedo.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to repeat what the three previous speakers have said, with which I totally concur. In addition, my colleague, Mr Swoboda, will also say a few words about the reasons behind this war. 

There is a very broad consensus within this Parliament condemning both the war against civilians in Chechnya and the terrorism which started in Chechnya, and this same consensus applies to the desire to maintain good and special relations with Russia. On the other hand, we are determined not simply to stand by and watch whilst Russia violates one international convention after another in this war in Chechnya. We support the proposal from Mr Lukin, the Co-President of the Interparliamentary Delegation of the European Parliament and Russian Duma to send a fact-finding mission to Chechnya to gather information on the ground. We want to make use of this information at a later stage, that is after the delegation has returned, as the basis for a major debate in this House, involving the Council and the Commission, and leading to the adoption of a really well founded resolution. For this reason and this reason alone we, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, urge you not to adopt a motion for a resolution today – which would in fact bring the total to seven – and instead wait until we have the information we need for an in-depth debate resulting in a joint resolution.

 Mr President, as you are calling on each Member in his own language, perhaps you could address me in Bavarian! Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet. In 1992, I presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the European Parliament. It is with some dismay that I have realised today that eight years later the same motion for a resolution could be presented on the same grounds, lamenting the same poor, nay appalling, conditions in Tibet. The Tibetans’ human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction, especially in Tibet itself. Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before. Millions of Tibetans have no human rights, let alone civil rights. Above all, they have no right of assembly, no freedom of association, and no right to freely practise their religion. For this reason we are calling on the Chinese Government as a matter of the greatest urgency to seek a political solution for Tibet through discussions with Tibet’s political and religious leaders, on the basis of the proposal made by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this. But I would like to stress this point: if a people is prepared to fight for its autonomous status without questioning borders and without separatist tendencies, then we should really be supporting them, as they are setting an example for our own European Union model!

 Mr President, thank you very much for letting me speak for the second time today. The recent presidential elections, which not only observed all democratic norms but also marked the end of the 50-year rule of the Kuomintang, secured the presidency for Mr Chen Shui-bian. The newly elected President reflects Taiwan’s democratic maturity. This makes the behaviour of the People’s Republic of China all the more worrying for us, as before, during and after the democratic elections in Taiwan the Republic did not cease to make in some cases totally unacceptable threats towards its little brother. I realise, of course, that the People’s Republic of China does not understand the word democracy. Nevertheless, there is no need for them to start panicking just because democratic elections are taking place in a neighbouring state. Unfortunately, democracy is not infectious!

 Mr President, there is a drafting error in Paragraph 2 of this resolution. I would like to propose – and this is in fact correct in the German version – that we should forward this resolution to the High Representative for the CFSP.

I would like to propose an oral amendment so that it reads “and the governments of the Member States, of the United States and of Iraq”.

 Mr President, I rise to speak about the vote on the Chechen resolution. During the debate and also during the efforts to agree on a compromise amendment, it emerged that there is a large majority who are of the same view as regards policy and substance. It can only be a matter of tactics if, at this stage, having adopted six resolutions already, we say the same thing, or virtually the same thing, once again without any serious debate with the Council and with the Commission. For this reason I would like to make this appeal to Members in the other groups: first of all, let us send the joint delegation to Chechnya. Everyone has agreed to this specific proposal. And then, when the delegation has returned, we can hold a major debate on Chechnya in conjunction with the Council and the Commission, and at the end of that debate .....

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we discussed Mrs Stauner’s report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the basis of an opinion by Mr Thielemans and reached a number of unanimous conclusions containing a different political evaluation of the 1998 discharge on which I have three comments to make: First, we take the view that we must learn lessons from past cases and, of course, clear up every single case for which we have new, additional proof. Nonetheless, we want to give the Commission instructions which look to the future, not instructions to deal with a past for which it is not even responsible.  Secondly, we passed punishable offences to the courts in a one-off show of strength during the last parliamentary term. We ensured that OLAF had the structure and facilities needed to pursue any suspicions or irregularities. We want, in the final analysis, to place our trust in the courts, OLAF and the disciplinary measures and decisions taken and to work together with President Prodi’s new Commission on a basis of trust and on the basis precisely of the relevant new rules and obligations introduced. Thirdly, this includes, as Mr Bourlanges explained earlier, acknowledging and accepting results such as the disciplinary proceedings carried out in the ECHO case, even if Mr Blak wants to fight this tooth and nail, as he said earlier. But every Member must, in the end, understand that, as Members of the European Parliament, we have to carry out our control duties as accurately as possible, but that we are neither detectives nor public prosecutors, let alone black angels of vengeance. Demanding a new audit, without submitting any proof or evidence, is hardly going to enhance the credibility of our Parliament.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I was a member of the delegation from our Group which visited Turkey. I do not want to recount my experiences at length, I just want to tell you what my impression was. It was one of disappointment. I am extremely disappointed that four months after obtaining candidate status, nothing serious has yet been done to move towards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, especially the political criteria. Commissioner, you mentioned the interministerial committee. It is true that numerous structures are being set up. I have been aware of this in Turkey since 1995. If they are obliged to comply with something, they start by setting up committees and commissions, interministerial, extraministerial, every sort of committee under the sun. The structures are superb, we can all agree on that. Except that they do nothing. For example, it would have been very easy without any committees, without any commissions, to abolish Article 312 of the Criminal Code; all it needed was a vote in the Turkish Grand National Assembly and that would have freed a whole series of intellectuals, authors, journalists and the very same Akin Birdal from jail. That is how easy it is to take the first steps. The Turks tell us they need time, they need a great deal of time, because this reform can only be achieved one step at a time. I warned you about that. I told you that numerous fellow Members here in this very House, in the European Parliament, were prepared to allow as much time as they needed, 200 years, 400 years, even more. But I belong to a Group which enthusiastically helped Turkey to achieve candidate status, not just so that Turkey could be a candidate but to give Turkey a real chance to become a member and start negotiations. Which is why we want to insist and want to press for Turkey to be helped on its way with a road map and a specific timetable and, of course the accession partnership which the Commissioner referred to earlier, and not just to remain a candidate.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, you spoke of a detailed programme in your introduction. I would like to comment on two aspects of this programme, notably the common security and defence policy and enlargement, with specific reference to Turkey, and would also like you to clarify a few matters. Mr President of the Commission, I am in favour of creating a European defence identity, including the military dimension thereof, and I welcome with open arms the outcome of the unofficial meeting of the Defence Ministers in Sintra. However, that must not be the end of the story. What is difficult on the one hand, and new and important on the other, is conflict prevention, i.e. the non-military aspect of our security policy. Conflict prevention is a difficult matter because we have no examples on which to base our formulation of these elements of security policy, unlike NATO, which can teach us a few things.   The Commission must take responsibility, launch initiatives, and submit projects in this sphere, which needs to be developed from scratch. We need specific proposals for instruments for non-military crisis management, such as delivering and deploying humanitarian aid – Mozambique is a good case in point – aid for the development of democratic institutions and procedures, election monitoring; we need to build up a corps of conflict advisers and a police force and so on and so forth. I need not go on listing the instruments we need ad infinitum. I would like you to comment on this, Mr President of the Commission. You state in your programme that you want to introduce a pre-accession strategy for Turkey. I would willingly support you there if I knew what you meant by this. Following the Helsinki decisions, we in the European Parliament demanded a catalogue of measures and a detailed schedule, which would enable Turkey to be prepared for fulfilment of the Copenhagen Criteria – in particular the political criteria – in a concrete and structured manner. My group was completely committed to Turkey’s being granted candidate status at the Helsinki Summit. We welcomed this decision and are very keen for this state to accede to the European Union. It will be a difficult task given Turkey’s shortcomings on the political front. Which is all the more reason why we need to develop a very clear, concrete and detailed policy, i.e. a catalogue of measures and a schedule.  Can we count on your Commission to submit suitable proposals to Parliament in the near future, on preparing Turkey for accession to the EU?.

 Mr President, High Representative for the CFSP, Commissioner Patten, on behalf of my Group I would like to address one particular area alone, which falls both within the remit of the High Representative and that of the Commissioner, i.e. Turkey’s candidacy for accession to the European Union.   My Group was unanimous in its support for the decision reached in Helsinki to afford Turkey an option for accession with the proviso that this country, like any other candidate, must fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. My Group attaches great importance to the fact that Turkey is being encouraged to fulfil these criteria. We have been concerned of late about the political developments taking place in Turkey, the arrest of the three mayors for example. That is not moving towards fulfilment of the criteria; on the contrary, it constitutes a move in the opposite direction.   Hence my questions, Mr Solana, which could equally well be addressed to Commissioner Patten: how, and according to what timetable, is Turkey to be brought up to EU standards following the Helsinki decision? Is there a list of tasks and a concrete schedule, in accordance with which, little by little, Turkey is to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria, notably the political criteria? And what supervisory and monitoring instruments have been put in place, both by the Council and, more importantly, by the Commission, with a view to overseeing this process of criteria fulfilment?

 Mr President, firstly I would like to take the floor to respond to the verbal attack that Mr Dupuis has just made on me, and this should not be deducted from my allotted speaking time. That was a personal declaration, Mr President, and I would like to add that my Group has asserted in a unanimous decision that under no circumstances do we wish to join forces with those who intend to sit with Mr Le Pen and the other right-wing extremists in this Parliament, in a compromise resolution or any other form of cooperation. We will not support a joint resolution; we will not conduct negotiations with them and we will not recognise their signatures on a resolution of this kind. That is what I wanted to say about the incident that Mr Dupuis spoke of.   Together with NATO, EU Member States waged a war for the sake of Kosovo. They declared that this war was needed to uphold human rights. I do not propose, at this point, to start yet another discussion on the effectiveness of the methods at our disposal for dealing with crises. My fellow delegates are well acquainted with my scepticism as to the legitimacy of military intervention and the effectiveness thereof. I accept that NATO and the individual Member States were in favour of getting involved in an operation of this kind, and that they believed that this was the only option remaining to them to put an end to the ever-increasing violations of human rights and crimes perpetrated by the Milosevic regime in Kosovo, and secure a dignified existence for the Albanian people.   Intervention did not succeed in preventing a human catastrophe; Kosovo is destroyed, fields cannot be cultivated, production centres are out of action and the economy is in a chaotic state. Serbia’s development has been set back decades and the people – Serbians and Kosovo Albanians alike – will be traumatised for a long time to come.   But the violations of human rights go further, and supporters of the Milosevic regime were not the only ones to trample human rights underfoot; sadly, those whom NATO set out to defend are guilty of the same. Disputes have been going on for months. Hundreds of Serbs had to leave Kosovo and we have just heard that KFOR soldiers are now coming under attack as well, along with refugee buses and the like in the vicinity of Mitrovica.   This is only a fraction of the ongoing acts of aggression against Serbs, Roma and other minorities, which are not just taking place in Mitrovica alone. Our commitment to Kosovo obliges us not to look away now either, when there are new violations of human rights, irrespective of who initiates them. Otherwise, we will lose all credibility.  This throws up another fundamental question: how effective are international protectorates? Can a protectorate be a panacea, or is it not more likely to entrench the ethnic divide within the protected province? Is it at all realistic to undertake to build a multicultural society in a protectorate following military intervention? I believe we must ask ourselves these questions or else we will not be able to find a solution for Kosovo.   And I would like, very briefly, to make some specific and practical proposals that will enable us to arrive at this solution. The national governments must despatch the required international police force to Kosovo with all haste, i.e. immediately. The donor states must release the promised financial aid so that the international representatives actually have the means at their disposal for fulfilling their tasks. The KPC, the Kosovo Protection Corps, must be investigated following suspicions that some members are involved in criminal activity, and appropriate steps must be taken. Finally, there is the demand that this Parliament made in the case of the last resolution: the representative of the UNO Secretary-General must build an administration there that will truly work in Kosovo’s interests.   (Applause)

Mr President, I am sorry to have to do something which I would not normally do, i.e. to explain a proposed amendment here. Mr de Clercq has raised the issue and I must take a stand. We have agreed on the text as it is printed. In it, we call on Israel to withdraw from the occupied areas of Lebanon. We agreed on the text as it stands. Now the Liberals and perhaps others in the House want to delete this sentence calling on Israel to withdraw from Lebanon. That is their right, but we cannot say that we have agreed on it. We agreed on the text as it stands.

Mr President, yet again Parliament is addressing the situation in Chechnya, and rightly so. We have stressed again and again in previous sittings that we are keen for the Russian Federation to find a peaceful and political solution to this problem. We really have appealed to the Russian government not to handle this case in a way which violates all the international conventions which it has signed. Unfortunately, we are still unable to report any easing of tension in this war. Far worse! The situation has deteriorated considerably. The situation the civilian population find themselves in in Chechnya has become intolerable. We have no opportunity to take humanitarian action, despite the fact that we have stressed, time and again, and the Russian Federation assured us at the summit in Istanbul, that it would at least be possible, both for observers from the OSCE and humanitarian organisations, to enter Chechnya. Nothing remains except to repeat what has been said here in the House and what we wish to stress yet again in this joint motion for a resolution. We want a political solution to this conflict and all parties must be called upon to negotiate such a solution. We want to relieve the situation of the civil population by calling once again on the Russian Federation to allow humanitarian organisations access to Chechnya and to allow OSCE observers to enter Chechnya.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I still have an excellent recollection of the last Portuguese Presidency in 1992. It set standards, and I and all of us here, Mr President, hope that your presidency will be equally successful. You have presented a large, ambitious programme. I should like to refer to a foreign and security policy aspect. I have some questions to ask and I would be grateful if you could give me a detailed position on these questions. First, Turkey. I supported candidate status for Turkey from the beginning and I welcome the result from Helsinki. Will the presidency now support this candidate by drawing up a list of measures and a timetable and allowing it to be included in negotiations on the same footing as the other twelve candidates? Is the presidency prepared to take an initiative to solve the Kurdish question – I am following on here from Mr Poettering, who referred earlier to the Kurdish question – for example, by supporting a conference such as the Madrid conference for the Near East? On the common security policy: Cologne and Helsinki raised our hopes in this regard. Now specific action needs to be taken. It must be action which can be accepted by all EU Member States, including those which do not belong to NATO. I have the feeling, Mr Gama, that you are orientated towards NATO and are wondering how we can create a structure which fits in with NATO. But that is not the issue. First we need a European structure; then we can ensure that it is compatible with NATO.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas. I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly. First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities. But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh. We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented. However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca’s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh 
Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe. My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel. I consider this to be very encouraging news. But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued. I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved. On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations. In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay. That would be a similar situation. My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union. I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos’ special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten. You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it. But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves. Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.

Madam President, we have discussed this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.

We therefore oppose the urgency tabled by the Council.

 Mr President, at the beginning of this year, anyone who was no longer able to stand by and watch the murders, expulsions, looting and pillaging by the Serbian army and militia in Kosovo and for that reason spoke out in favour of so-called humanitarian intervention, must now wonder whether the war – that was unfortunately not waged against those who committed the crimes, but against the Yugoslavian population, – the war that we conducted for over two and a half months and that cost several billion euros, really brought about the result that we expected. Have the murders, expulsions, looting and pillaging in Kosovo stopped? Unfortunately not. Unfortunately the crimes are continuing, with two differences. First: the victims of the crimes are no longer the Kosovo Albanians, but Serbs, Roma and even Bosnians. Secondly, it is no longer the Yugoslavian army in Kosovo, but our armies, which on the one hand are completing a fantastic undertaking in reconstruction, in protecting people, bringing law and order, in every respect and on the other hand are despairing because they are not able to really protect the people that they should protect and that they would have wanted to protect. Who is to blame? Unfortunately those for whom the international community waged a war, the first war on humanitarian grounds. The former KLA – I say “former” because it supposedly no longer exists, because it was supposedly disarmed – believes that it has won a war and that it therefore has the right to commit exactly the same crimes as those who led to this war. And that is the disgrace! The international community has until now just looked on at what is happening. We would assure the UN representative, Mr Kouchner, and his former colleagues, of our full support, if he would finally begin to set up an administration in Kosovo and not leave that to the bogus and illegitimate government of the KLA, even if the local authorities and the city and local councils were not formed by the KLA, but actually – if not other Kosovans – other UN officials could complete this work and the various different tasks that need to be performed in Kosovo.

 Mr President, our colleagues have already spoken about the military coup. I should once again like to emphasise what Mr Duff and Mr Mann have said. For decades elected, but altogether corrupt governments and most recently that of Mr Nawaz Sharif, have allowed violations of human rights, slave labour, social disasters and a foreign debt that is out of control to be part of daily life in Pakistan and all this has led to the ruin of the country. The same governments supported the fundamentalist murderous regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan and represent a constant incalculable risk to peace in the region because they support and stir up terrorist activity in the border region of Kashmir against their Indian neighbours. Despite everything, we should not allow ourselves to consider the military coup as a possible alternative to the incompetence and corruption of an elected government. We condemn most strongly the military coup in Pakistan and urge those in power to restore the rule of law and constitutional order immediately by setting up a civil transitional government in accordance with a clear timetable to restore parliamentary legitimacy by holding elections. These should be the preconditions to be fulfilled before the Council signs the suspended Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan. The EU as a whole must adopt an unambiguous position towards Pakistan, which stresses that for us, democratic principles can neither be negotiable nor the subject of compromises and that any future would-be dictator must prevent such dreadful behaviour.

Mr President, I do not need to repeat what the Commission and the Council have said on the situation in Chechnya. I would just like to emphasise one area which can serve as a justification for our joint resolution on Chechnya: the suffering of the civilian population; the hundreds of fatalities; the 200,000 refugees and their plight given the onset of winter; the overreaction of the Russian government and the indiscriminate bombing of the civilian population. I have the impression that this is not a legitimate war against terrorist activity, but a political power struggle at the cost of the population. (Applause)
 For this reason our Parliament must clearly say what it wants and what it doesn’t want. I shall summarise: firstly, we are not disputing the right of the Russian government to fight the brutal terrorism in Dagestan. Secondly, we in no way wish to jeopardise the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. Thirdly, however, we cannot condone aeroplanes bombing the civilian population! I condemn these bombings, just as months ago I condemned the bombings of Novi Sad, Belgrade and Nis, which were described as “collateral damage”.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to use the term which President Clinton used to characterise the behaviour of the Senate. He called this irresponsible. This irresponsibility has dealt a severe blow to all international efforts towards non-proliferation and puts nuclear disarmament into a state of severe crisis. It seems that much more important to me at this time for the EU to take the initiative in this area.  I welcome the initiative of President Jacques Chirac, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Prime Minister Tony Blair who, in an open letter to the American public, canvassed in favour of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That was not enough. We know that. Therefore, we must do a lot more. We must think in concrete terms and we must take action. I am a little disappointed, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have only told us what we have read in the newspapers anyway. I congratulate Commissioner Patten on the very concrete steps which he has presented here. Commissioner, I should like to urge you to collate these steps in a kind of action catalogue forming part of a report for the European Parliament. In that way, we can become active, take initiatives or make further proposals to the Council.  I should finally again like to support what the European Parliament decided on 18 November of last year when it supported the eight States’ declarations of 9 June 1998 concerning the new agenda coalition for the rapid, definitive and complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Demand this, and the European Parliament ought to renew its support.  (Applause)

 Mr President, the chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party expressed his sympathy with regard to my own group, because at the time we made heavy weather of the decision on Customs Union. I would like to return this sympathy on the grounds of the ease, with which the Group of the European People’s Party has undergone a complete U-turn in its position since the agreement on Customs Union. Mr President, I have listened attentively to what the President of the Council and also Commissioner Verheugen have said on the subject of the possible candidacy of Turkey in Helsinki. I would have welcomed it if it really had been an honourable position of the European Union with regard to Turkey. But I am afraid that we are re-establishing a policy which, for decades, has permitted us to hide behind the Greeks and say that the Greeks would never agree to it. Now, as the Greeks are showing that they would agree under certain circumstances, we must, in fact, come clean. We must really ask ourselves in all conscience if we want to have Turkey in the European Union or not. Nuances of wording, whether it concerns one candidate for one candidacy, as in this case, or whether we should establish a new category of candidates, who are indeed valid candidates but with whom no negotiations are held, will by no means be beneficial to our relationship with Turkey. My last remark concerns a matter in which nuances of wording once again play a role. We are always talking about the Kurdish question, but we never talk about the Kurdish people. This is a people of between 12 and 20 million individuals, who nowhere, either in Turkey or in other countries, can enjoy their freedoms, human rights and rights as citizens. We must support the cause of these people.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, a lot has been said about the reconstruction of Kosovo. You know that this Parliament has gone to the utmost trouble to find a compromise strategy, and we shall stand by this compromise strategy and are prepared to make our contribution to it.  I should like to touch upon two questions which do not directly concern reconstruction but which are of special importance for the future not only of Kosovo but also of the entire region. About 15 days ago, the UN’s special envoy, Mr Kouchner, introduced a new currency to Kosovo. I do understand the need for a stable currency, partly for the benefit of the work being done there. What I do not understand, however, is the penalisation of the dinar, the official currency of the state to which Kosovo still belongs. The second resolution contradicts the convictions of us all and also the agreement made between the UN, NATO and the KLA. The KLA is not being disarmed, at least not completely. Instead, there are still KLA units, only they now put on different uniforms and will still be armed. Have we, as the European Union, an opinion on these resolutions, Mr Vice-President of the Commission and, if so, what is it?
Sakellariou (PSE

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, in your speech this morning you said that the Commission was to become much more open. You spoke in this connection of the need, here and now, for glasnost. In doing so, you went to the heart of the problem. Last year’s conflict between the Commission and Parliament was largely due to the Commission’s culture of secrecy and to the arrogance with which the Commission handled Parliament’s justified concerns. I hope all this belongs to the past and look forward with yourself, Mr President of the Commission, to a new beginning.  I turn now to the Committee’s hearings specifically in connection with foreign affairs, human rights, and the common security and defence policy. A general remark, first of all. If we were to set the qualifying standard for Commissioners at the level displayed by my colleague Ingo Friedrich at the hearings and also in today’s debate, we would not have any difficulties with anyone. However, Commissioners-designate Günther Verheugen and Chris Patten have no need of formal qualifying standards. They have both engaged in an excellent debate in committee and provided real proof not only of their specialist qualifications but also – and this is almost more important – of the new political culture to which you yourself have referred, Commissioner, and of the dialogue between the European Parliament and the Commission.  Of course, we have identified differences when it comes to political opinions. It would not be understandable if it were otherwise, but it is precisely that which makes collaboration interesting and preserves us from boredom. All the co-ordinators were subsequently correct in agreeing that our committee had gained two valuable and esteemed partners in dialogue. Mr President of the Commission, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has also arrived at the same consensus regarding Commissioner-designate Nielson. I say this because our committee too was involved in this matter. I should like to assure you and also the other Commissioners that we shall offer critical co-operation and engagement in dialogue. I have no difficulty in repeating what my group chairman said a short while ago, namely that we shall be expressing our confidence in you.

Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with all the previous speakers who have said that the debate on the future financing of the Union is still in its infancy, and indeed we may stand on the threshold of some rather hard bargaining. It is therefore, as my fellow Member Mr Böge said, far too soon to talk about figures, ceilings and minimum allocations, but what do we actually think of the Commission’s basic approach? Let me begin with what we perceive to be good points. The Commission is proposing a different set of budget headings from those to which we are so accustomed. It is also proposing a somewhat different aggregation structure for the individual EU policies. One of the new categories is to be sustainable growth, and another will be conservation and management of natural resources. This is the result of the Commission having paid very careful heed to Parliament’s frequent discussion of budgetary priorities. We want to become the most competitive economic area, and we want to preserve a decent world for our children and grandchildren. About four fifths of our budget is to be devoted to this aim. ‘Wonderful’ is all I can say to that! A German saying, however, tells us that there is no light without shadow. The main shadows are in those areas where the Commission has kept its own counsel. I cannot find any reference to its ideas and proposals as to how the European budget is supposed to acquire the funds we intend to devote to the pursuit of our policies. It would have been better if the Commission had accompanied the financial perspective with its ideas on how to reform the Union’s own resources. That would have forestalled several squalid discussions about Member States’ contributions, but perhaps the Commission can still plug these gaps. I hope it does.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived late, but that is because we currently have not only mining waste to deal with, but also – basically, indeed, anticipating the next parliamentary term – and again, with our REACH system, in other words with chemicals policy. I have just been spending the evening with BASF, a major chemicals business, and have had to leave them in a rush in order to get here. The Group of the Party of European Socialists is very happy with the legislation we now have on waste from the mineral-extracting industry. What we in Europe need is unified standards for the management of this waste, which will not only lead to greater similarity between the conditions under which companies compete in the Member States, but will also, at the same time, improve the public’s living conditions and their environment. The Committee’s deliberations generally focussed on the definition of what is meant by waste and on the financial guarantees to be provided by the industry, but a broad majority backed what we agreed on, and there was general agreement on it; we hope that the plenary will tomorrow follow us in that agreement. We want every company to be obliged to ensure that it is able to repair any damage to the environment for which it is responsible. We do not insist that only one form of financial surety should be possible. Although we have left a great deal of leeway and many options, the Member States and the Commission must guarantee to us that this will work. When it came to defining mining waste, we took on board everything from everyone who engaged in the discussion process – the industry, the environmental NGOs, the Court of Justice, and, not least, the Commission. There is no question of us in the Committee having voted to reinvent existing legislation; quite the contrary, that is precisely what we have avoided. We have made a number of improvements to the Commission proposal with environmental considerations in mind. We have made the connection between ecology and economy, something that Social Democrats have always been keen to do. The fact that the plenary has only 20 amendments from the groups to vote on testifies to the good work we have done in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I found working on this dossier with my fellow Members of the Committee a very pleasant experience; the Commission, too, was very helpful on many occasions, and so let me now express my warm thanks for that.

 Madam President, Commissioner, members of the Council Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, the Budget resolutions are about setting down in figures the policy that one wants to implement; it is about turning one’s own political priorities into a proper structure of figures that will stand up. This year, my group, that of the Party of European Socialists, has again been successful in playing its part in this. We agreed, early on in the year 2000, that we would make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, with qualified full employment and greater social cohesion. This, the Lisbon objective, is our guiding star, and we must not lose sight of it even when we are fighting over the many minor lines in the Budget. It is precisely there, among these rather minor lines, that we find expenditure on our action plans, ‘e
Europe 2002’ and its offshoot, ‘e
Europe 2005’, which are meant to prevent regions and people from being left behind by the headlong developments in our information society. In this regard, it is also important that we should have sufficient funds available to be able to promptly and effectively integrate the new information and communications technologies into Europe’s education and training systems. Not only does e
Learning, a multiannual programme, work towards social cohesion and towards bridging the digital divide, but it also improves opportunities for lifelong learning and enhances the European dimension in education, and that is something we need. We need people to be innovative and mobile, people who are capable of putting the new technologies to work in innovative production processes. Innovation creates new jobs, most frequently in small and medium-sized enterprises, support for which needs to be further stepped up. We know that small and medium-sized enterprises employ over half the EU’s workers, that they produce something like half the total turnover in the European Union, and that they are innovative and geared towards growth. All this adds up to sufficient reason for a Social Democrat like myself to keep harping on about the importance of support for SMEs, whether this be by implementing the lines for action from the Charter for Small Enterprises, by helping SMEs to put new technologies to good use, or by improving their financial environment. In all this, we have to pay particular attention to the very small firms, the micro-enterprises, even though the Commission is proving to be a bit clumsy about this. The fact is that they make up the majority of our businesses. Our average SME employs five people. From this moment on, we need to make greater efforts towards achieving the targets we set ourselves in Lisbon, indeed much greater efforts in view of our having twenty-five, rather than only fifteen, Member States, from May next year.

 Mr President, Commissioners, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, in the areas of environmental protection, consumer protection and health, we keep on, at European level, we keep on attempting to tackle very ambitious projects that are intended to improve the public’s quality of life in every area: environmental action programmes, action programmes in the field of public health, consumer protection strategies, strategies for the environment and health, and so on and so forth. But what about the resources that are needed if we are to be able to successfully bring these projects to fruition? This is where the Commission’s preliminary draft Budget is rather timid, characterised by willing submission to the Council’s mania for indiscriminate austerity measures. How else is one to imagine the genesis of this PDB, which the Council or – to put it a better way, the functionaries in COREPER – have tightened up? That, let me add, for a year in which the Budget is to be drawn up not for fifteen Member States, but for twenty-five, for which it must be adequate. That, though, is the Council with which we are familiar, ceremoniously signing treaties, but refusing to put its name to the budget appropriations for them. Just do not let the Commission get into the same way of doing things. We know that the ten new Member States’ institutions are in need of a great deal of reconstruction where the protection of the environment, consumer policy and health care are concerned; these are areas in which, despite the funds made available under the pre-accession strategy, they have as yet achieved nothing of any substance. Not only have we learned that from the Consumers International 
report, but the Court of Auditors has also enjoined us to take good note of it. Of course we want ‘greening of the budget’, consumer protection as a mainstreaming principle in all European policies, and awareness at every level of Europe, but, to do that, we need operational resources and resources in terms of personnel, and these have to be made available. That will not be done only by pithy strategies or action programmes written down on paper – which, of course, does not blush!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as I do today on Mr Glante’s highly technical dossier, I give an opinion on it in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Our position, too, is characterised by the environmental aspects. The Committee on the Environment agreed on that unanimously, after the vote had, indeed, been deferred twice by reason of the somewhat laborious discussion. The significance of a safe, economical, and environmentally friendly supply of energy is not a matter of dispute. The production of energy to a high standard could also be guaranteed by building power plants based on a system of cogeneration, which, when compared with separate generation, has the advantage that it makes the most efficient use of fuels, whether from fossil or renewable sources. Moreover, the process of cogeneration can avoid the emission of carbon dioxide, which means that stepping up the promotion of cogeneration plants is an essential instrument in the package of measures required to comply with the Kyoto protocol on global climate change. In the European Union at present, however, cogeneration is not yet being used to its full potential as a means of saving energy. A substantial extension of its use is indispensable when it comes to dealing with climate change and saving resources. Along with securing the energy supply, another fundamental objective of the draft directive submitted by the Commission is to create a framework capable of promoting the building and proper operation of cogeneration plants. We believe that the draft put forward by the Commission is right in principle, but in need of improvements at various points, a view taken also by the members of the leading Committee and expressed by their rapporteur. Whatever happens, we want to see the ambitious objective laid down that the proportion of the total electricity generated in the European Union by cogeneration plants should be doubled, rising from 9%, as it was in 1994, to 18% in 2012. We need transparent rules on what can be promoted as a cogeneration plant, rules that must be applicable throughout the European Union. The two-stage procedure proposed by the Commission, with its classification of energy for agriculture, industry and heating, does not provide that transparency; instead, it simply demands an excessive burden of administration. It is for that reason that we want to impose as standard an index figure for electricity and 80% efficiency. That, at any rate, is what the Environment Committee has decided. In addition, cogeneration plants with an output of over 50 megawatts should also fall within the maximum aid envisaged by the EU. There is no doubt that the limit proposed by the Commission is set too low. Even small cogeneration plants can produce 100 megawatts, or even more. Small and medium-sized plants ensure decentralised implementation, which can certainly make for effectiveness in terms of protection of the environment. We must do more to counteract increasing global warming, and a cleverly conceived directive on cogeneration plants can certainly help to do that.

 I did not vote in favour of the report by Mr Böge and Mr Colom i Naval, which reflects the result of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament. My concerns are not allayed by the result of the trialogue, which was intended at least to limit the damage that the Council has done to democracy in the EU. Annex XV remains in the Accession Treaties and will thus become primary legislation. Everything else, I regard as empty words. Only after years have elapsed will we be able to begin to prove that the opposite is the case. The Council, though, has already demonstrated that it is acting against 
Parliament. See also my explanation of vote on the Accession Treaties.

 I voted to approve the Accession Treaties only under protest and out of solidarity with my future colleagues. Despite the Commission's warnings and reproaches during the course of the negotiations, the Council has insisted on committing what is without doubt a breach of the law. The Council's controversial retention of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and consequent wholly unilateral alteration of the 2004-2006 financial framework amounts to a breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council. By doing this, it has trodden Parliament's budgetary rights underfoot. At the same time, it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties. Such behaviour by the Council puts an end to our loyal cooperation with it.

 Madam President, Commissioner, our debate is being conducted under the heading of ‘reform of the budgetary procedure’, which is a modest title for an ambitious enterprise. It would probably be more appropriate to speak in terms of a reform of the financial constitution, for we want the Convention to produce a coherent draft for a constitution that will advance European integration. We want the Treaty to be underpinned by democratic legitimacy, to be transparent and effective, and to give the public unambiguous answers to their questions as to what the federation of states and peoples called Europe can – and must – achieve in the interests of its citizens. The European Union's Budget must enjoy the very same democratic legitimacy in its function of financing European policy. What we urgently need, then, is not just changes to the Budget procedure, but a reform of our public finances, and what this will require is plain for all to see, encapsulated in our demand for all Budget areas to be subject to the codecision procedure – even decisions on the own-resources system, the structure of which is in need of fundamental change. Whilst it has to be admitted that the present system of finance works, it meets with criticism quite apart from its undemocratic nature. Neither what we receive from VAT or out of gross domestic income can really be described as the European Union's own resources. The fact is that they are transfers from the Member States, and that is precisely the argument used by the Member States when the positions of net contributors are under discussion. It is not immediately evident to the public which taxes go towards financing the EU's outgoings. The proportion of what are termed traditional own resources is decreasing all the time, and the whole system is mutating from genuine self-financing into the transfer of lump sums. Nor does what we call the British rebate have any rationale behind it any more, Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Wynn, and, wearing only my one hat – in my capacity as rapporteur for the PSE on own resources – I can tell you that, in that area too, the British rebate makes no sense any longer, any more than does its being funded in different ways by the other Member States. It should be abolished! (Applause)
 The structure of the Budget has ceased to provide any justification for it. Changes have had to be made in the structure of the European Budget's expenditure over the past fifteen years. Policies already in existence, such the agriculture policy, were reformed, and other policy areas were added, such as structural policy and pre-accession aid, and this renders obsolete the imposition of an unfair burden on everyone else by preferential treatment for Great Britain. All this leads to the logical conclusion that we should introduce a tax to replace the former own resources, and that this should be done without imposing additional burdens on European taxpayers, who would, though, be able to see, at last, how they are funding the European Union. Let us in this Parliament, then, not demand less than the Commission has already done, but, rather, join together in taking a great step towards greater transparency and democracy. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our rapporteurs, Göran Färm und Per Stenmarck, have already produced the broad outlines of our future Budget for 2003. Previous speakers have highlighted particular points and added new ones. I wish to do the same and highlight one small point, one that Mrs Buitenweg has already mentioned. My particular concern, as incidentally has been the case for some time now, is small and medium-sized enterprises and above all micro-enterprises. We cannot invent a new priority every financial year, so I am sticking to this one. That is why I will also repeat what many of you know, but it will not do any harm to remind you of it again: 99% of all companies in Europe have fewer than 50 employees. They employ more than half of all workers and are also responsible for around half of the European Union's entire turnover. On average each company employs five people. It is small and medium-sized enterprises that are very innovative and growth-driven. They therefore play a decisive role in the fight to increase jobs and reduce unemployment. That, for a social democrat, is what counts! We are already doing a certain amount at European level to increase the competitiveness of SMEs; let me remind you of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship. However, we want to do even more. The project 'SMEs in border regions' should be replaced by a project on 'SMEs and enlargement' and – a number of social democrats have in any case spoken strongly in favour of this – we want a project that helps SMEs to implement the concept of 'Corporate Social Responsibility – a business contribution to sustainable development'. So far these proposals have tended to be directed more at the large companies. This comes as no surprise: after all they were involved in drafting them. We do not consider this to be wrong, far from it, but now we want them to be extended to include guidelines for our small and medium-sized companies. We want a pilot project on SMEs and social responsibility.

 Mr President, Commissioners, have no fear, I am neither a fisherwoman nor a farmer. Neither do I wish to comment on the reform of agricultural policy. My contribution will be confined to reiterating yet again my request for cofinancing. I have been asking for this for three years now. That should be enough! I am here as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as a shadow rapporteur. The person I am shadowing, Robert Goodwill – who is the rapporteur for the budget – has already left. All of the areas of agricultural policy on which I have questions or which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tackled have already been addressed by him or other colleagues. The first is tobacco subsidies. This issue has been raised time and again since 1994. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is calling for tobacco subsidies to be abolished. Obviously the Committee on Budgets cannot accommodate this request because we have a market organisation and we have to work within the legislative framework. Hence my very specific question to you, Mr Fischler: when is the Commission finally going to table a proposal explaining how it will contrive gradually to convert the areas under tobacco? I know that there is any amount of discussion about this. And I do not mean these half-baked ideas which are envisaged for the tobacco fund. Neither is it acceptable for you to answer that it is all far too expensive because converting jobs – in whatever sector – costs anything from EUR 31 000 to EUR 391 000. My next question concerns the Food Safety Authority. When are you finally going to put pressure on the Council to let us have the Food Safety Authority? (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Podestà Report on implementation profiles is a very important one, and I would like, at the very outset, to express my thanks to Mr Podestà, the rapporteur. Anyone who knows me will know that this is not one of my usual ritual practices, but I do think Mr Podestà deserves thanks for taking over the task from our erstwhile colleague and general rapporteur for 2002, Carlos Costa Neves, and for taking over the job I started to do in 2001, observing the implementation of the Budget over the course of the year. That is a laborious business and far less appealing that the work on the forthcoming Budget year. How the Commission implements the Budget and makes use of its resources for the purposes that we decide on at the end of the preceding financial year deserves proper scrutiny. Looking at the course of a Budget year, one sometimes wonders how closely the intentions of the budgetary authority have been adhered to. A Budget year can positively teem with supplementary and amending budgets and much carrying-over of appropriations. Closer examination reveals that, taken as a whole, the appropriations carried over add up to a redeployment of funds from one line to another totalling some 1% of the total Budget. Not that much, then, one might think. But, as several Members of this House have pointed out, a lot of funds are not spent at all! From the 2001 Budget, the Member States are getting EUR 15 billion back, that is, over fifteen times the total of appropriations carried over. Even though we cannot generally accuse the Commission of disregarding our policy intentions, all of us together – by which, in this instance, I mean not only the members of the Committee on Budgets, but also the members of the specialist committees – have to support the Commission right through the year and see to it that they do not lose sight of our policy intentions. Trust is a good thing, but control is a better one. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1996 a Council Regulation introduced a new revised European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 1995. This revised system superseded the old ESA 1979. Its use was made compulsory for all Member States. It applies to all acts of the Community – all except one. For budgetary purposes and for the determination of the Communities’ own resources, the old system is to stay in place for as long as the Council Decision of 1994 on the system of the Communities’ own resources remains in force. Back in 1994 it was assumed that there would be a new decision on the Communities’ own resources in 1999. As we know, it actually took until the end of September 2000 before the Council plucked up the necessary courage. At the same time, however, the Council tried to railroad us here in Parliament into a quick decision. A grim picture was painted of the scenario that would ensue if Parliament did not adopt the Council Decision without amendment and, later, if we insisted on a second reading. A delay, we were told, would be intolerable, the Communities’ own resources from VAT could not be collected properly, the Member States would incur high costs, because statistics would have to be collected for both accounting systems, and so on and so forth. Sheer balderdash! Since the year 2000 all the statistical offices have in any case been compiling their respective accounts on the basis of the 1995 system. The ESA 1979 data are not even available any more – a fact, incidentally, which the Council has now formally acknowledged in item 2 of its common position. So if we approve the common position at the present time, we shall merely be legalising a fait accompli
. In other words, we had all the time in the world, and we wanted to take this opportunity to issue another urgent reminder of the importance of the revenue side in the compilation of the budget, to re-emphasise that revenue is the key to our prospects of funding our European policies. In its common position, the Council has only adopted the first of our amendments, the one in which we stated that the change from ESA 79 to the ESA 95 system for the determination of the Communities’ own VAT-based resources would have no impact on the level of these resources, neither in terms of the balance between Member States nor of the overall volume of the Communities’ own resources. The Council has rejected our Amendments Nos 2 and 3, in which we sought to guarantee better annual information for the budgetary authority on the state of play with regard to the Communities’ own resources in the form of a Commission working paper and to establish a trialogue with the Council and the Commission in this domain. Yes, the Commission has subsequently written to us, indicating its willingness to provide us with such a working paper every year, for which we are grateful. No, the Council does not wish to engage in talks with us. There is no provision for such a trialogue in the interinstitutional agreement, it says. Huh! So much for the constant preaching about transparency! Then there are those who say that the discussions about our own resources have no place in legislation on statistics. Admittedly, we cannot invoke Treaty articles, the Financial Regulation or interinstitutional agreements. Admittedly, statistical legislation is not the most attractive vehicle, it is not the ideal means of getting our demands through. We do not have a formal legal base, but we have a right, the right of equality for both branches of the budgetary authority in all matters relating to the common budget. If the participants in the Laeken Summit, the post-Laeken convention and the subsequent intergovernmental conference speak of democracy, they must also speak of the democratic right of Parliament to exercise full powers of co-decision on the European budget, and they must not only speak but also take action. If, by the end of these meetings, Parliament has obtained its rightful budgetary powers – co-decision on all expenditure and revenue – that will be a satisfactory outcome. Anything less, and the word ‘democracy’ in the mouths of Council members will not be worth the cost of the electricity that feeds their microphones! (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are holding the joint debate about the three reports produced. Looking around, we all know already what everyone is going to say, and we have said it all before. Even the Commissioner has listened to us more than once, so let us just say it one more time for the record. The Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget is a completely non-contentious issue in the Committee. The most important points are, firstly, funding for 27 new posts for RTD projects; secondly, the OLAF establishment plan and the necessary funds in the budget line for the recruitment of new staff; and, thirdly, an increase in the Commission’s payment appropriations required for the EU assistance in the Balkans. In other words, we want an additional 100 million plus. This was all agreed unanimously in the Committee on Budgets with the support of all our colleagues. At this point, I would like to thank Herbert Bösch very warmly once again for the solution to the OLAF issue. He worked very hard to ensure that we reached this compromise. The fact that the balance from the 2000 budget gives rise to a surplus of EUR 11.6 billion is one reason for this House to underline yet again that the budget management is very frugal, and for the Council it is a cause for rejoicing. However, what is the report concerning the European Union’s own resources about, and why has it been drawn up? We – Parliament – have taken the initiative and called on the Council to discuss with us, prior to every budget procedure and before the Commission produces its draft budget, the situation concerning the European Union’s own resources. Please note that I said ‘discuss’, not ‘codecision’. We thought this was a very cheap option, but far from it, the Council is resisting, and that is what it is doing this evening too. It is simply not listening! It refuses even to discuss the European Union’s revenue with us. As a result, we looked at the EU’s own resources without having discussed them with the Council. What we noted for the 2001 budget year is no different from the trends observed in previous years. Traditional own resources and VAT resources are becoming less and less significant. The transfers from the Member States as a GNP resource share have increased steadily. In total, own resources constitute 98.3% of revenue for the 2001 EU budget. This is equivalent to 1.06% of their GNP, which is far less than the own resources ceiling percentage of 1.27% laid down in the financial perspective. This shift towards the GNP resource can undoubtedly be viewed with mixed feelings. It could lead to a fairer division of burdens between the Member States, as GNP is probably the best indicator to measure the relative wealth of the Member States’ economies; indeed, if we look more closely, some Member States already cover 22, 29 or even 33% of their contributions to the European budget from traditional own resources – in other words, from money which has already belonged to the European Union for some time. Secondly, it changes the nature of the European Union’s own resources, transforming them from real own resources into a form of Member States’ contribution. Thirdly, it simply does not create a visible link between the European Union and its citizens. When the Belgian President of the EU, Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, spoke this morning, it warmed my heart. He too is questioning this indirect financing of the European Union. He too is calling for more transparency. He too wants citizens to become more familiar with the European Union, and this includes more transparent financial arrangements. We want financial autonomy at European level, and we want to work towards this now. We want this financial autonomy to be shared jointly and on an equal basis with the Council, and we want to have co-decision rights in this area. We want equal rights in all areas; we want to be one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, in respect of all expenditure and all revenue. We want complete budgetary autonomy. A European tax may still be a long way off, but the Belgian presidency, the Belgian President of the European Union himself, has called for this. The Belgian Finance Minister supports this demand, and even the German Finance Minister no longer rejects it outright. A European tax may still be "future music", as the Germans say, but if we do not start playing it now, we will not be dancing to it in future. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the adoption of the 1996 Council Regulation on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community, we have had a new and modified system, ESA 95. However, this new system for budgetary and own resources calculation will not apply until the new own resources decision comes into effect. When ESA 95 was adopted, it was assumed that the new own resources decision would be adopted in 1999. We now know that in fact that did not happen until September 2000. It will probably come into force on 1 January 2002, if all the Member States ratify it without delay. So that is the legal position. It is evident that the Member States have now adjusted their own national accounting systems and that data is no longer available on the 1979 basis. This means that the letter of the Commission's proposal amending the regulation on the determination of Member States' payments to the VAT-based own resource does not match actual practice. We, the entire Committee on Budgets, are assuming that the switch from ESA 79 to ESA 95 will have no impact on the level of own resources, that is neither on the balance between the Member States nor, of course, on the total volume of own resources. So far, so good. Honourable Members will perhaps think that this is a rather dry subject, but we have taken advantage of this opportunity under the codecision procedure, and we should never forego any opportunity to emphasise the importance of own resources in setting the European Union's budget and financial perspective. When you do that, it does not seem so dry any more, because it is no secret that Parliament, as one arm of the budgetary authority, would like to have full budget rights, that is to say codecision not just on expenditure but also on the revenue side. That is why we are now trying to take a tiny step towards that goal. The Commission is willing to actively support us in this task. I really wish to specifically thank the Commissioner very sincerely for that. It is willing to present a working paper on the state of play regarding the collection of own resources to us at the beginning of the budget process. This document will also provide information on good and in some cases not so good collection practice in the Member States. And it will provide us with a good basis for discussion, for a debate with the Council on EU revenue. However, it is also no secret that on this issue the Council's approach is just as unwieldy as the rather long title of the regulation whose amendment we are discussing right now. Not only will it not consider codecision with Parliament on own resources, as was apparent at Nice, it does not even want to talk with us in either a formal or informal trialogue. And please note that we are not talking about negotiations here, just discussions. The Council is simply refusing to cooperate with Parliament on this – and not just refusing to cooperate but refusing to grant Parliament some of its parliamentary rights. This not only affects the budget, it seems to be a general trend at present. Members are having to fight for their parliamentary rights as regards the framework legislation on financial services. We are having to fight as regards the directive on the European Company statute. We are having to fight over human resources for the common foreign and security policy. I really do not claim that this is an exhaustive list, but one thing is clear: safeguarding Parliament's rights is not something that can be taken for granted in 2001 – Members themselves have to constantly fight to secure these rights. That is why I am utterly convinced that my colleagues, including the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, will firmly support us when we insist that there should at least be a discussion with the Council on our own resources.

 Mr President, we are concerned with this Amendment and also with Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the resolution. As rapporteur, I should inform you that these amendments have already been presented in committee and were rejected in committee where there was a tied vote.

Mr President, it has taken rather longer than expected, but we must discuss these important issues before turning to the less important ones. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our task is to vote on a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget – the first this year – which was adopted by the Commission on 31 January and has already been adopted by the Council on its first reading. There are several aspects to this Supplementary and Amending Budget. It is intended to modify the remarks for budget line B7-541 in order to enable the European Agency for Reconstruction in the Balkans to extend its activity to Montenegro and cover its administrative costs. It aims to update the EUR/dollar exchange rate, as obliged by the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline. While the 2001 budget is based on a parity of EUR 1 = $ 0.91, the Commission will have to present the required adjustments to EUR 1 = $ 0.87. This will then give rise to what are really only virtual savings of EUR 245 million. EUR 60 million will be transferred from the reserve to finance the agreed BSE tests. And then there is the issue which is of crucial interest to us all, as is evident from the discussions and debates held over the last week: an additional EUR 971 million will be released to cushion at least some of the impact of the BSE crisis. The figure of EUR 971 million is broken down as follows: EUR 700 million will be used to cover the 'purchase for destruction' scheme for cattle over 30 months, EUR 238 million will go towards the buying-in of beef in public stocks, and an extra EUR 33 million will be used to finance the additional BSE tests conducted on cattle over 30 months intended for human consumption. Let me make it clear from the outset that I am in favour of adopting the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget, albeit in a modified form. I say “modified” because we should give some encouragement to the Member States to take on more responsibility for the common agricultural policy. So I support the draft, although I sympathise with those Members who want to reject this Supplementary and Amending Budget in its entirety. My initial reaction was to say no to the draft as well. Since I became a Member of the European Parliament, I have had to defend the common agricultural policy at home. And that really is not an easy task. We spend almost half our budget on our agricultural policy, and almost a fifth of that goes on supporting beef production. But now that the beef market has collapsed, we are supposed to come up with almost EUR 1 billion to destroy the beef cattle which have been raised at such expense, because they have become unsaleable. And it is very difficult – if not well-nigh impossible – to explain to the general public, the taxpayers and consumers, why this has to be done. For one thing is clear: though this may be an enormous amount of money to cushion the initial impact of the BSE crisis now, it will not be enough for the rest of the year. It is the proverbial drop in the ocean. Or a tiny bit of sticking-plaster on a suppurating wound. And this suppurating wound is our common agricultural policy with its system of production incentives. These mechanisms date back to a time when there was still a shortage of most foodstuffs. But these times are well and truly over. Today, there is a surplus – a glut – in all the key markets. Coupling financial support with production creates an incentive – indeed, a necessity – to increase production and rely on more and more intensive production methods. This intensification has a significant environmental impact and marginalises less productive locations. And we cannot even defend the system on social grounds, for while the large factory farms have constantly expanded, small family farms have gone to the wall, unable to survive under these conditions. In total, 80% of EAGGF funding flows to less than 20% of farms. We have to break away from this system. We cannot merely continue to treat its symptoms: we have to find a cure. By its very nature, the system simply creates more and more problems. So let us use this latest crisis as a chance to overhaul our common agricultural policy. Let us use it as an opportunity for reform, focusing on the following objectives: maintaining a sufficient number of farms to preserve the environment and the cultural landscape, and recognising two core elements of the farmers' role, namely to produce high-quality foodstuffs while protecting the environment within the rural development framework. And, of course, also achieving one of the European Parliament's longstanding goals: the promotion of rural regions. However, this means supporting other forms of economic activity as well as agriculture. Let us see the Supplementary and Amending Budget as the final step in our old agricultural policy – a step which has to be taken because no other instrument is available quickly. But when we come to adopt the next financial measure, we must have a clear outline of a reformed agricultural policy. For one thing is clear: although as a budget specialist, I have to focus on the financial aspects, I am well aware that the current crisis is not a financial crisis at all but a crisis of our agricultural policy. And the sooner we set about correcting the problem, the better. Now that two million cattle are to be slaughtered and destroyed in an effort to ease the burden on the markets, there is talk of an ethical problem. Ladies and gentlemen, two million older cattle are slaughtered every year in Europe. This is business as usual in other words. But as a rule, these animals end up on the dinner table, not in an incineration plant. However, I think it is a little far-fetched to talk about ethics. Especially when there is talk of a 'Herod premium' in relation to a calf slaughter programme. Good heavens, we do pride ourselves on our Western Christian roots, don't we – so I would just remind everyone that King Herod killed new-born male infants. He killed people, not animals. And despite all our love and understanding for animal protection, we should leave the church out of it. There is a difference between humans and animals. Let us not forget that. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets welcomes the proposed rapid reaction facility. We support this Community mechanism, which is designed to make resources available for urgent non-combat activities related to crisis management and conflict prevention. It is right and fitting that the European Union should help to preserve or restore public order and to facilitate dialogue, conciliation, mediation and the prevention of human rights abuses. All of this, however, can only be achieved or become achievable if the facility really is able to respond rapidly. That is why we emphatically support the Commission's proposal that implementation be based on the committee system, including the involvement of an advisory committee, with the emphasis on the word 'advisory'. Now over the years, as you know, the Commission – with Parliamentary backing, I hasten to add – has been pursuing a strategy of gradually transferring activities from the ambit of the common foreign and security policy, in other words from the second pillar of the European unification process, to that of the Community, the first pillar. This trend is continued by the current proposal for the rapid reaction facility. So far, so good. But the funds for this purpose must be allocated under Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective. And all Members of this House have been made aware by at least the last two budgetary processes just how tight our finances are in the foreign-policy budget. Every year, this allocation has been the subject of our bitterest budgetary wrangling with the Council. We have no need of a crystal ball to predict a similar situation this year. For that reason we have asked the lead committee to do two things: firstly, to call on the Commission and Council to outline their intentions and particularly to explain how they intend to divide up responsibilities between themselves in this field and how they intend to finance the relevant activities, and, secondly, to add a recital to the proposed text stating quite clearly that rapid reaction interventions must be financed within Heading 4. Should that be impossible, provision must be made for a revision of the Financial Perspective. In addition, we want an obligation to consult Parliament on each action to be financed under the facility. The rapporteur and the lead committee have complied with these budgetary wishes. For this we are very grateful to them.

Madam President, in Tuesday's debate I expressed my thanks for the wholehearted cooperation I have received from the President of the Council, the Commissioner and the honourable Members of the House, and I spoke of the feeling of solidarity we all had with one other, which, I believe, has now brought this budget to a successful conclusion. At this point, since a large number of Members are present in the chamber, I should like to repeat that the only reason why I was able to perform my task as rapporteur so effectively was the work that was done with me and for me by the marvellous secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, which has worked extremely hard throughout the year, putting in many, many hours, including weekends. The members of the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, whether they work front stage or behind the scenes, have been very, very cooperative and highly competent. I wish to convey my sincere thanks to them and I call on the House to show its appreciation with me. (Applause)
 I should like to announce a few fairly minor technical adjustments very briefly. We shall have modifications to Amendments Nos 171, 187 and 21 in Document 12. Since the legal bases now exist for the programmes we adopted with the Council, the money will be brought forward in these cases from the reserve to the budget lines in question. I believe my honourable colleagues will all subscribe to these modifications. The programmes involved are the action programme for equal opportunities, the MEDIA programme and the action programme against discrimination. The last announcement I have to make relates to Amendment No 197. This amendment concerns MEDA. We intend to keep the remarks we adopted at the first reading for the second reading as well. I think that is all I have to say for the time being. I am sure the House will endorse these decisions. (Applause)
Haug (PSE

Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking the President-in-Office, who negotiated with us, with Parliament, in a shrewd and tenacious manner, often without the support of her colleagues, by thanking the Commissioner, who never once lost sight of global European interests, both on and off stage, and by thanking all my colleagues who backed me at the most crucial moments, even where they were of a different opinion, and who were supportive and joined forces in order to defend Parliament's position. My sincere thanks to one and all. Without such teamwork we could never have arrived at what is now a relatively comfortable, by that I mean perfectly tension-free situation. There now appear to be no further obstacles to Parliament's passing a resolution on the European Union budget for 2001 on Thursday. The chairman of the Committee on Budgets tells me that this is the very first time that agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament at conciliation. So well done everyone! There is a proverb which says that money makes an evil master but an excellent servant. As the elected representatives of the people, we parliamentarians have acted in accordance with this proverb. We have not harped on about principles. We have not set budgetary objectives in advance and then tried to tailor our policy to them. We wanted a proper, economical, logical budget which would allow us to honour our political commitments and really help those who need our help. So we agreed with the Council during the night of 23 to 24 November on the main points of what is a perfectly reasonable, although by no means brilliant budget. Whichever way you look at it, it is reasonable not to give up in the fight against unemployment in Europe, which is why we keep insisting on the need for action at every political level – at local, regional, national and at European level. The European budget will include EUR 450 million to promote employment over the next five years by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. If we implement the action lines described in the charter on SMEs and help SMEs to apply new technologies, we shall, I think, have found a way of creating jobs. The agreed EUR 450 million is more than four times what the Commission proposed in the preliminary draft budget and frontloading EUR 100 million next year should get us off to a flying start. The Committee on Budgets proposes that plenary remove the reserves set up at first reading. This applies both to the performance reserve under the heading foreign policy and the administrative expenditure reserve. We have stated time and again that we support the reform of the Commission and that we agree to the 400 new posts, combined with a new early retirement scheme, but only subject to certain conditions. Some of these conditions have now been met. The Commission has submitted its analysis of outstanding commitments and its strategy for eliminating abnormal outstanding commitments. We put the final touches to a joint declaration by the Council and Parliament in a trilogue last Tuesday. We all agreed that the Commission should draft a report by the middle of next year on progress made in phasing out commitment backlogs, implementing programmes and simplifying project cycles, a report on how comitology is working, on progress made in implementing the reform package and on the performance targets of the main programmes under Category IV, to mention just a few aspects of the joint declaration. We now expect the Commission to start work at soon as possible. Apart from a few minor skirmishes started or continued by the Council at second reading, our second reading has been stripped of most of its contentious points, mainly because we have stated that we are prepared to help the Council achieve what it sees as the extremely important objective of reducing the increase in payments to 3.5%. This will be achieved mainly by removing the Structural Funds reserve set up at first reading and making fewer payments for Community initiatives, which need to be rebudgeted anyway. The Commission's Letter of Amendment no. 2 which, following renewed calculation, has deducted around EUR 900 million from the sum needed for Category I, was also extremely helpful here. This Letter of Amendment is most welcome and I imagine that Parliament's consent to it is most welcome in the Council, because it also contains an estimated surplus for the current budget of EUR 900 million, which can be entered straight away under revenue for 2001. What worried us most right through the budget procedure was how to fund our foreign policy. Our financial perspective for Category IV was clearly way off target since the war in the Balkans. The Commission therefore suggested revising the figures by EUR 300 million. The Council fought against this tooth and nail and it was impossible to reason with it on this point, just as it was last year. For the Council, the financial perspective is a monstrance and must not be changed. It has made it into its evil master, to continue the proverb which I quoted earlier. We were therefore forced to do a deal with it on the EUR 200 million flexibility instrument, as if this did not represent a change to the financial perspective. But at least we now have a further EUR 200 million at our disposal, although we did in fact need another EUR 300 million. But we can at least fund what we think is the most important task, i.e. the democratisation and reconstruction of the western Balkans, from a total of EUR 839 million, including EUR 240 million for Serbia. We refused to allow our other foreign policy priorities to be whittled away still further. We can finance cooperation with the Baltic region and our crisis reaction forces and we have given MEDA EUR 40 million more than the Council provided. So, as you can see, we have cobbled together a solution for the 2001 budget. However, this solution is weak on political and budgetary planning, because it takes no account of the fact that money is needed over a period of several years. I should like to have responded to long-term requirements with proper multiannual planning. All this means, of course, is that we shall face the same mountain of difficulties during the next budgetary procedure. I hope that the person who succeeds me as Parliament's general rapporteur and the Belgian Presidency of the Council, which will be taking over in the second half of next year, enjoy their discussions. I know from my own experience just how difficult it is to keep all the groups in Parliament together. However, I also know from the discussions that it is far more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council position, obtain a mandate and accommodate pure national chauvinism in a fairly reasonable and tenable overall European decision. Naturally, that does not only apply to purely budgetary processes, as the Nice Summit so graphically demonstrated yet again. So we stand once again at the end of a year and ask ourselves how, in Heaven's name, we can make the Council see reason and make a good servant out of an evil master. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would point out though that we still have not received an answer to one question, namely whether the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is prepared to withdraw its amendments. I would be very interested in this, because it is by far our most serious problem. You see, if we accept one single amendment – you know this, fellow delegates know it, I have said it more than once – then we will, as it were, already be in breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement, because we will then have gone over the margin for payments. Would you perhaps like to repeat the question to someone from the Committee on Agriculture?
Haug (PSE

 Madam President, as we do every year and in every budgetary procedure, we will of course have to start by voting on a few additional technical adjustments. Last-minute negotiations have been held with all the groups and, in my capacity as rapporteur, I should like to table a number of technical corrections on five points. The first concerns line B3-300 on information measures. Here the groups have agreed to place 50% against the budget line and to leave 50% in the reserve, and not to put the total amount in the reserve as previously decided. The same applies to line B3-306 for the PRINCE information campaign. There too we should now like to place 50% against the budget line and 50% in the reserve. Where line B5-312 – for the Medicines Agency in London – is concerned, we should now like to pay an additional 1.3 million because we have noted that the Agency now has a heavier workload because of orphan drugs. So, we have an additional 1.3 million for the Medicines Agency. The fourth line concerns the performance reserve. When we decided on the performance reserve in the Budgets Committee we made a technical correction, deleting two lines in this reserve which no longer contained any amounts at all, just p.m. entries. These are lines B7-5211 and B7-547. They concern cooperation with the Baltic region and the civil administration in the Balkans. The final line in this compromise package for the groups is A-3027. This relates to the International Centre for European Training. Here it is intended to place the total amount against the line – so there are no longer any reserves – and at the same time, the appropriations are to be increased by EUR 300 000 to 1.8 million. These are the technical changes. They have been agreed with the groups, and I would ask you to make the necessary adjustments before the vote on the budget so that we can go into the vote with the package agreed.
Haug (PSE

 Madam President, Mr Maat may wish to make the same comment as me. You see, we spoke again this morning. Amendment No 929, tabled by the Budget Committee, concerns two lines in heading 1b. They relate to young farmers and environmental measures. I should now like to propose an oral amendment to change these lines. We give the young farmers an additional 10 million and take the 10 million to finance this from the environmental measures. The effect on the overall budget is neutral, but we would accommodate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Haug (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, in that case the amendment will unfortunately have to be put to the vote in the form proposed by the Committee on Budgets. You all know that, unfortunately, there is no margin, especially not in 1b. There is no margin at all there.
Haug (PSE

rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would also have been delighted to welcome our Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Budgetary discussions are nearly always guided by the principle that money is not everything, but without money, all is nothing. It is marvellous to have you with us Commissioner. So here we are in October 2000, with only a short while to go before the financial framework for Budget 2001 is agreed. Over the past few weeks we have repeatedly scrutinised all the figures, forecasts, and categories of our budget. We have turned each individual budgetary line inside out, so that the figures we decide on on Thursday are viable, and so that Budget 2001 does not have a fairytale-like quality. We will submit a budget that accords with the principles of wholly economical budgetary management. We have been very careful with the European taxpayer’s money, very strict yet still reasonable. The figures that we, as Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, are to put before the House, will not meet – and of course we are a little disappointed about this – with the unanimous support of all our fellow delegates in the specialist committees. But we set our own rules, and even kept to them and acted in accordance with previously adopted principles. By the time we had finished, our draft for the first reading could be said to be true to the motto that the art of drawing up a budget is to spread the disappointments evenly. No doubt it is the Council that has been left most disappointed, but it has absolutely no one but itself to blame for this, indeed it probably deliberately provoked it. How else are we to interpret the Council’s proposal that payments should be increased by a maximum of 3.5%? Parliament, at any rate, understands that the payments to be included in Budget 2001 are a function of the commitments entered into in previous years and those we hope to enter into in 2001, and we must determine them accordingly. Even the Commission’s estimate of payments for the preliminary draft budget has been very cautious, too cautious as far as we are concerned. If you look at the budgetary implementation schedules for headings 2, 3, 4 and 7, then you will note that only an average 8% of all commitments are covered by payments. Quite a number of budgetary lines are not covered at all. When you then consider that the Commission would concentrate initially on cutting back the amounts outstanding in such a situation, which naturally we would also favour, there would, however, be far too great a risk of not being able to continue with a budgetary line deemed important by Parliament. It is a mystery to me how, on this basis, the Commission is to preserve the strict relationship between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations, which it is in fact committed to do under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement. Therefore, in principle, we have raised the payments in headings 3, 4 and 7 to a level that will ensure 25% coverage of the commitments to be entered into in 2001 as regards individual budgetary lines. However, we sometimes asked ourselves during the discussions, how the Council could justify its vote, for example with regard to heading 1. When the Commission put forward a proposal, in late spring, to take the EUR 300 million required for the revision of heading 4 from the margin left in heading 1, the Council vehemently resisted this straightaway. On no account was the margin to be reduced! But that did not stop the Council from cutting agricultural expenditure by a total of EUR 555 million. Where is the logic in that? Essentially, we have reinstated the preliminary draft budget in its entirety. Above all, we want there to be sufficient money available under heading 1B, for the development of rural areas. There must also be adequate funding available for those areas whose aim it is to achieve a knowledge-based society and to improve the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union. We took the Commission’s line and increased expenditure for research by 8%. What is particularly dear to our hearts though, is something that we have campaigned for from the very outset of this budgetary procedure, i.e. to be able to make an appropriate contribution, through the European budget, to fighting unemployment. The level of unemployment in Europe is still intolerably high. Countermeasures must be taken against this at every political level; i.e. at local, regional, national, and I hardly need mention, at European level. Three years ago, we launched our employment initiative, which involved helping small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire risk-bearing capital. We are all aware that most jobs in Europe are in small and medium-sized enterprises, and that they are the ones that create the most new jobs. We all know too, that it is no longer all that difficult for high-tech SMEs to acquire capital, because – and our initiative helped bring this about – the capital market situation of these companies has in fact improved considerably. Therefore we want an employment initiative with a slightly different emphasis. We want to carry on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they are able to benefit from our common market in exactly the same way that larger companies do. Above all, we want to equip them to make use of the new technologies. The various instruments we have at our disposal to this end should enable us to succeed in this, whether we are talking in terms of start-up capital, sureties, loan guarantees, or even the joint European venture instrument. Cross-border cooperation between SMUs is precisely what we need to create the European added value we are all always so keen to achieve. We should therefore continue to deploy this instrument, albeit using simplified procedures, as proposed by the Commission. We have therefore earmarked almost EUR 120 million for two budgetary lines combined. If you now take a look at the lines covering labour market measures and local employment initiatives, you will see that a total of almost EUR 150 million has been made available for job creation measures under heading 3. That, to my mind, sends out a clear signal. Clearly, we also want to help with the reform of the Commission, and provide support where this has an impact on the staffing situation. We accept that 400 new posts need to be created, but would attach certain conditions to this. We expect the Commission to set out, before the second reading, how it intends to implement the Budget more efficiently. We expect it to explain to us what steps it will take to ensure that Parliament receives better information more quickly, and is kept up-to-date on the implementation of the reform package. We expect it to step up the efforts it is making to bring the legislative process more into line with the budgetary process. In addition, naturally we take the view that it would not be acceptable simply to create 400 additional jobs, i.e. on top of those already in existence. Therefore we welcome with open arms the fact that early retirement arrangements have been put in place as part of the reform process. Quite often, the drafting of the Budget is seen as a methodical way of establishing the sad fact that we cannot get by on our revenue. I believe that is what many of us – i.e. many of you – think when you consider heading 4 of the budget. After all, we are very poorly provided for when it comes to financing our external policy. For more than a year now, Parliament has been urging the Council to work with it on negotiating stable and secure reconstruction aid for the Balkans. The Council has persistently refused to do so. The people of the Balkans have repeatedly been promised aid by the various Council Summit Meetings. However, back home, the Council shirks from countersigning the promised cheque. In other contexts, people would say they had been ‘duped’. In drawing up its preliminary draft budget in June, not only did the Commission endeavour to secure the financing for the Balkans aid, it also tried not to cut back on the other areas of external policy too heavily. That is precisely when it did the logical thing and proposed the revision of heading 4. But not only did the Council refuse to negotiate with us over a possible revision of this kind, it even went so far, at its first reading, as to reduce the funding for the Balkans, MEDA and TACIS by EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million, and EUR 20 million respectively. And I have only mentioned the worst of the cuts at that. This is completely unacceptable! Parliament will abide by its traditional priorities. We will make appropriate sums available for those of our budgetary lines concerned with democracy and human rights, cooperation with non-governmental organisations working in the interests of the poorest countries, our cooperation with Latin America, South Africa and Asia. We will adopt the Council’s proposed level of funding for MEDA, and would urge the Council to join us in using the flexibility instrument, should it become apparent in the course of next year that MEDA requires more money. But let us return to the Balkans. Our margin will allow us to pitch the level of reconstruction aid EUR 50 million higher than the figure decided by the Council. Add to this our carry-over from Budget 2000 to Budget 2001 under the Notenboom procedure and we will have the amount that the Commission deems appropriate. Following the happy outcome of the elections in Serbia, we are, however, now obliged to support Serbia with financial aid and not just with fine words and grand proclamations. Parliament’s preferred approach is twofold. We have created a new budgetary line entitled ‘democratisation’. EUR 60 million have been set aside for this purpose, which is money our Budget can easily spare. But we want to reinforce the point that this is intended for the democratisation process in Serbia. We have created a second budgetary line entitled ‘reconstruction’. We have included a so-called token entry in this. We urge the Council to join Parliament in weighing up all the possibilities that the Interinstitutional Agreement has to offer, and to set an appropriate level of funding for aid to Serbia. This is irrespective of the EUR 180 million we transferred last night for emergency aid, for the remainder of the year, because this money has come from the emergency reserve and is only to be used for humanitarian aid, i.e. to help the Serbs get through the winter during the last few months of the year. In addition, though, we expect the Council to finally get together with Parliament and take a look at the multiannual allocations, both for MEDA and for CARDS, and decide on a suitable figure. We cannot go on like this, slugging it out with one another budget after budget; always over the same issues, and always going through the same motions. On Thursday we will adopt a trim, but sensible budget. All I can say to the Council is: follow our example. Our goal cannot be to diet to the point of collapse. All too often, weight-consciousness turns into anorexia. But there is more to a viable and dynamic Union than a supposedly slimline budget. If we want to command respect on the international stage, strength and competence are the order of the day! (Applause)

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, Commissioner, honourable members, as the last person to speak on this agenda item, all I can do of course is make a few points and reiterate a few things that have already been said. But as you are all yourselves aware, repetition is the only way to learn. First of all, I would like to thank the Council for the constructive cooperation it has provided throughout the year’s trialogues and in all the conciliation meetings. However, it is not just the current Council Presidency that I should like to thank, but also the previous one, the Portuguese Presidency, for creating a thoroughly cordial atmosphere despite all the differences of opinion. I shall therefore deliver the good news first: compared with this year’s budget, both the Commission and the Council – albeit only temporarily – have proposed a total reduction of EUR 144 million in the budgetary lines for employment. But Parliament has already made it clear in its guidelines that the issue of job creation is very close to our hearts, and that one of our first priorities in internal policy is to fight unemployment in Europe. This is our determined aim, our goal, and we gave renewed expression to it in our resolution of July. We have always found the Council ready to listen, both under the Portuguese and now under the French Presidency. Accordingly, not only did the Council declare, in the course of the conciliation procedure, that it was willing to support our job creation initiative through suitable instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises, we have also agreed to come to an understanding, in the course of the budgetary procedure, on an amount within the meaning of number 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, which we intend to use to achieve our goal. So far, so good. So what exactly are the problematic areas? Where do Parliament and the Council differ? In view of the limited amount of time available to us all, allow me to mention just two. Firstly there is the manner in which the Council seeks to finance those policies where there is fundamental agreement. As Parliament made clear last year, we believe it is necessary to undertake a multiannual revision of Category 4 in order to meet the requirements for reconstruction aid in the Balkans in a stable and secure manner. The Council flatly refuses to countenance such a revision of the Financial Perspective. It obviously prefers a hand-to-mouth existence. No revision! That is the name of the game. The Council has obviously made this its guiding principle, for how else are we to interpret the fact that it persists in refusing to commit the funds for the pre-accession countries Cyprus and Malta to Chapter 7 of the pre-accession strategy? After all, that is where they belong logically, and in terms of content. But the Council does not want there to be a revision, even if it is not bound up with a financial amendment. As a Parliament, we now have an extremely difficult decision before us with respect to Category 4. The second major bone of contention is the Council’s tendency to focus time and again, in the course of its budgetary readings, on payment appropriations alone. The Commissioner made the same point. I cannot say whether it is because of our institutional view, or whether it also says something about our personally held views, that we both majored on this in our criticism. The Council’s declared aim was an increase in expenditure for 2001 of only 3.5% in comparison with the figures for the current budget. The outcome is a draft budget in which the ratio of commitments to payments is no longer sound. For example, on closer inspection, it is possible to discern that the commitments for 2001 are not matched with adequate payment appropriations. In category 2, for example, the commitments are covered to a mere 2.1%. In categories 3, 4 and 7 the situation looks better, but still not good. In many lines of the draft budget, the payments do not even cover a quarter of the commitments. In quite a few lines, no payments whatsoever have been earmarked for the commitments for 2001. This no longer has a great deal to do with serious budgetary management. I need hardly emphasise again that the Interinstitutional Agreement – which, incidentally, we concluded only 1¼ years ago – sets out as a matter of course, at various points, that there should be an orderly working out of the European Union’s expenditure, which should be regarded as being closely linked with the working out of the commitments. In fact it means that a strict relationship should be preserved between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations. The Council is neglecting this close relationship in the most criminal way. Its aim is to reduce expenditure. It argues that, at the end of the day, the Member States have to put their national budgets in order too. That is all well and good, but it must not be allowed to bring our own common European budget into disorder from the very outset.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European public’s need for information is still very great, although monetary union is already in place and euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation before too very long. There are less than 75 weeks to go in fact. The Committee on Budgets, in common with all Members of this House, is very much in agreement with the objectives described in the Commission communication on the communication strategy covering the final stages of the completion of EMU. We also believe that there should be incentives and support for companies, especially SMEs, to enable them to carry out the work needed to change over to the euro. Furthermore, enhanced preparation is just as desirable and important for all our citizens and for all consumers. We all need to change over to the euro in our daily lives. It was not of course for the Committee on Budgets to assess the content of the Commission communication in detail: we limited ourselves to budgetary aspects. We wish to point out once again that in the interinstitutional agreement it was stipulated that information policy is an autonomous action which does not require a separate legal basis. For the reason mentioned, this particularly needs to be brought to the attention of the Council again. However, I would particularly like to remind you that the Prince programme was initiated by Parliament through budgetary intervention in 1996 with the clear aim of financing information campaigns on priority issues for the EU. This was to take place at interinstitutional level, as at that time we were convinced, as we are now, that this would ensure that the available funding would be spent as effectively as possible. We therefore wish to stress once again that the decision on the breakdown of appropriations and the guidelines for implementation, including joint actions, is taken on the basis of the opinion given by the interinstitutional working group. This working group was specifically referred to in the budgetary remarks, and that is how it should stay – and that comment is particularly for the ears of the Commission! For that reason we wish to reinsert the relevant remark on budget headings B3-300 and B3-306, which the Commission evidently ‘forgot’ to include in its preliminary draft budget for 2001.  I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee responsible for including our remarks on this in the conclusions. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having discussed and adopted our guidelines for Budget 2001 in the spring, we are now drafting and formulating the position we intend to take up in the conciliation procedure. This procedure will begin with a trialogue on Thursday evening, followed by conciliation on the outcome of the trialogue in the traditional meeting of delegations at the time of the Council’s first reading. This meeting is due to take place on 20 July.   The new interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure, which was concluded on 6 May last, have revised our old ad hoc procedure. Our current conciliation procedure has become the centrepiece of the procedure for interinstitutional cooperation in budgetary matters. This procedure now encompasses two topics, firstly the one that was covered by our old ad hoc procedure, i.e. agricultural expenditure, including the expenditure resulting from fisheries agreements, along with the EU financed CSFP expenditure.   However we should also discuss all the other expenditure; at least discuss it, even if we cannot agree. Because the conciliation procedure creates the framework that makes it possible, as it says in the interinstitutional agreement, to continue the debate on overall expenditure development and the essential features of the budget for the coming financial year in the light of Commission’s preliminary draft budget. That is precisely the stage we are at now.  We are in possession of the Commission’s draft budget, and our motion will contain advice for the Council on its first reading of the budget. This advice will be clear and unequivocal. One of our main priorities was, is, and remains support for the peace and stability process in the Balkans. We asked for a multiannual programme for this as early as last year, so that the financing for this process would no longer have a hand-to-mouth existence but would be placed on a firm footing. We have already inserted a revision clause in the interinstitutional agreement to this end, in conjunction with the Council and the Commission. In addition, as early as December last year, we drew up a joint declaration, together with the Council, during our last second reading.   Accordingly, the Commission has now presented a proposal for revision of the financial perspective and for a multiannual programme for the Western Balkans. It has also submitted a preliminary draft budget based on the revision of the financial perspective. We welcome this initiative from the Commission, because we believe that it is absolutely vital to revise the financial perspective if we are to honour the commitments entered into by the European Union in the Balkans. However we do not think that we should finance our aid to Kosovo and the Balkans simply by carrying out a multiannual redeployment of our traditional priorities in external policy, and making cutbacks in our cooperation with developing countries and in the aid we deliver to the poorest of the poor.   By adopting Agenda 2000 we have already agreed to a 22% cut in heading 4, albeit only on condition that the appropriations needed for Kosovo and the Balkans are financed by fresh money.   Consequently, we are expecting the Council to enter into constructive negotiations with us to this end, and hope to reach a conclusion before the Council’s first reading.   Permit me to make a few comments on the traditional aspects of the ad hoc procedure. We take the view that when it comes to heading 1a, i.e. agriculture, we are completely justified in waiting until the Commission has sent its Letter of Amendment before we amend the ceilings. We are delighted that the Commission has budgetised in heading 1b the full amount available under the financial perspective, and we hope the Commission will be able to make full use of it.   Last year, Parliament fought tooth and nail for heading 1b. We are not so fickle as to behave any differently this year. But we certainly take a keen interest in the transformation of the nature of the appropriations for heading 1b into differentiated appropriations.   As far as the fisheries agreements are concerned, we are expecting that as in previous ad hoc procedures, the Commission will submit updated, realistic figures before Parliament’s first reading that we will then be able to take into account.   We think it is right and proper that the CFSP is becoming more and more of a Community policy, i.e. CFSP actions are being transferred from the Second Pillar to the First Pillar. However, we would like to press home to the Council that this must not lead to more and more cuts in the amounts available for our traditional external policy measures What we absolutely cannot agree to is the Council’s attempt to finance the Special Envoys in its own budget. The gentlemen’s agreement only applies to administrative expenditure. The expenditure for the special representative is of an operational nature. If such a step was taken without the agreement of Parliament, then we would deem this a violation of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the part of the Council.   That was the advice I wanted to give the Council. There will be more in the motion that we are due to vote on tomorrow. We expect the Council to take account of our deliberations and decisions in those of its own.

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your presentation. I should like to pick up straight away on your closing words. I do not think that we should harp on about principles during our discussion of the Budget 2001. But I also think that this is a call directed at the Council rather than a call directed at us, notwithstanding what has been submitted to us parliamentarians so far from the preliminary draft budget for evaluation. This leads me to say that, first and foremost, the Commission has taken account of the Council’s wish that it present as economical a budget as possible. You, yourself, said just now that the Budget 2001 is only 1% higher than the Budget 2000 without agricultural expenditure and we all know that agricultural expenditure accounts for a huge part of our budget. To then talk of rigorous financial management to us alone is, of course, completely misplaced, especially as we here in Parliament are in favour of economical financial management. The debate and the budgets which we have voted in the past demonstrate this and that is the way it should stay. Allow me to remind the House: agricultural expenditure for the organisation of the markets is to rise by 7.6%. Expenditure on rural development – and you stressed that we of course set great store by rural development – is to rise by 10.1%. On the face of it, these relative figures alone, i.e. the percentages, are highly satisfactory. But we all know that market expenditure in the current budget is over eight times higher than expenditure on rural development and that market expenditure in the next budget will be over nine times higher than expenditure on rural development. This may take account of the wishes of the Council and of Council’s decisions, but it does not take quite such good account of the wishes of Parliament. It is through Category 3, which encompasses all our priorities – not only Category 3, Category 4 also of course – but it is mainly through internal policies that all citizens perceive the European Union. When you see that the budget has been set at around EUR 6.13 billion and then you compare that with market expenditure, then you see that market expenditure is six times higher than the whole of Category 3. Knowing that four-fifths of all expenditure is tied in with multiannual programmes, and that, of course, 80% of all these multiannual programmes are decided under the codecision procedure, then the 1.4% increase proposed by the Commission is purely and simply the effect of the increase in research expenditure. Nevertheless, you want to increase this expenditure by 8% and research expenditure accounts for over 60% of Category 3. I know that the Commission is endeavouring to take account in the budget of the priorities it has accepted, namely creating a knowledge-based society and improving the quality of life of our citizens. So far so good. We can support that. But what about Parliament’s priorities? We discussed our priorities well in advance both among ourselves and with the Commission, and we adopted our guidelines well in advance, including for Category 3. You have just picked out a few points but when we see that education and youth policy are to rise by 1.2% then we must say – looking at the entire heading – that that is because next year is the European Year of Languages and the expenditure for it will rise by 275%. That is perfectly normal and we have supported that. If you look at the Culture and Audiovisual Media heading, there is a 2.7% increase. I would have expected it to be higher. Information and communications have risen by 4%. But what about social dialogue and employment – down 4.7%. What about energy policy, which we have fought for tooth and nail time and again? You have cut it by 8.2% and you have cut environmental policy by a hefty 28.2%. To my mind, the preliminary draft budget, as it now stands, takes no account of Parliament’s priorities. Mrs Schreyer, what I personally hold dear to my heart, namely innovation and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises – yes, you have put a figure in the budget for this, but you have cut what we still had in the last budget by nearly 70%. We urgently need to discuss this so that the budget also clearly sets out our priorities. I have just this to say about Category 4: I think it is asking for trouble to support Serbia with such a small amount in 2001 and, at the same time, to say that once Serbia has democratised we can again use our flexibility instrument. And one last comment which cuts across both Categories 3 and 4: what about the timetable on the legal framework for the offices for technical and administrative support or transformation promised by you and Commissioner Kinnock? You wrote to us last December saying that a proposal would be submitted in the middle of April. We are all dying to see it. It is now the middle of May and we hope that it will make an appearance shortly because it is also important for our budgetary procedure.

Mr President, it is a shame that Mr Patten had to leave so soon. I actually wanted to put my question to him. But I think that Mr Nielson is equally well placed to answer me because he has been standing by his colleague’s side and he also said that both Commissioners were responsible for the proposal. Mr Nielson, of course we here in Parliament share your aim of providing quicker aid to men and women, and raising the profile of the European Union. That goes without saying. But we had all agreed that what the Commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us. When Mr Patten says in his presentation that either the Commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts, I find that highly displeasing. It is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and I think that the Commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts. That, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us. I should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we face an enormous challenge with the budget for the year 2001. The first budget of the new millennium must strengthen the social and cultural dimension of Europe and honour the commitments which the European Union has set itself vis-à-vis its citizens and vis-à-vis the international community. What does that mean in practice and what do we expect from the Commission as we draw up the preliminary draft budget, Commissioner? Of course, we assume that the budget will take suitable account of policies newly introduced or reinforced by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Even if we have deliberately dispensed in the Committee on Budgets from including detailed information and statements on each of these political areas, this does not imply that they are any less of a priority but merely that we wished to be as brief as possible and we expect commensurate account to be taken of them. We still consider the implementation of equal opportunities, equality and environmental sustainability to be priorities which we wish to see anchored in the budget. The main priority for the budget 2001 must still be to remain active in the fight against unemployment. That does not mean, and let me be quite clear on this, financing huge employment programmes at European level, nobody wants that. What we do want, however, is to provide the strategic momentum needed so that small and medium-sized enterprises can quickly start using the structures of the new information and communications technologies and participating in the information society. This form of strategic initiative will safeguard international competitiveness and development potential and hence strengthen the enterprises which continue to provide the majority of jobs within the European Union and which still create most new jobs. I am pleased to report that we are at one with the Council on this point and I am sure that we shall be able to implement some of the commitments and objectives formulated in Lisbon in the forthcoming budget in a spirit of partnership and consistency. Apart from this core initiative for the budget 2001, we must not allow the quality of economic and political integration achieved in the meantime to eclipse our cultural identity as Europeans. This does not mean centralisation and standardisation, by no means; on the contrary, it means promoting cultural diversity. Supporting the regional cultural industry means that we shall be laying its economic foundations and securing its potential to develop. We want the next budget to meet the challenges of efficient administration and guarantee the necessary transparency in European finances. We support the Commission’s efforts to introduce Activity Based Budgeting. We support efforts to allocate administrative and personnel costs openly and clearly to each budget area and this must be accompanied by efforts to improve political control of the budget and to improve the implementation of political priorities. Parliament sets particular store by this. We shall monitor these objectives closely during the reform process. But one thing must be absolutely clear: any attempt to reduce parliamentary scrutiny and control of the budget will not be accepted. The greatest challenge, however, is in relation to our commitment to reconstruct and secure peace and stability in the Balkans. I would stress here quite clearly and unequivocally that, as far as the objectives are concerned and the need to provide the necessary funds for them, there is no dissent whatsoever. The European Parliament also stands by these commitments. We know that the Council also stands by its commitments and, at the donor conference today, the Portuguese Foreign Minister stated, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council wished to secure lasting stability in the Balkans and that efforts would need to be made over several years in order to achieve this. In other words, the Council recognises these demands and these commitments. However, we expect the Council to set itself these new challenges and to act accordingly. Gaining the ability to act in this important foreign policy area while, at the same time, losing it in other foreign policy areas as the result of excessive savings is unacceptable. Allow me to make myself quite clear. The interinstitutional agreement and the budget 2001 are indeed two different pairs of shoes, but both pairs must fit, otherwise we will be unable to walk in them and we will get nowhere. I must stress the fact that we are not questioning the interinstitutional agreement per se; we stand by this agreement, but we are calling for a review which takes real account of demands in a specific area, namely the additional cost of assistance for the Balkans and certain other foreign policy measures. This call is obviously directed at the Commission and the Commission will submit its proposal accordingly; however, this message is also directed at the Council, above all at the Council. I have the very real impression that when the round of finance ministers hears the words ‘review of the interinstitutional agreement’, it immediately thinks of wasted money and sees red. But a review is not a catastrophe; it is a perfectly normal procedure which in no way questions the spirit of the agreement. Histrionics do not help, they merely create unnecessary fronts. What we need in order to finance the measures referred to is flexibility. Without flexibility we will get nowhere. I therefore call on the Council to stop adding fuel to the fire. Do not commit yourself to a blockade attitude towards the review. Take your cue from us and work together with us to find a constructive solution which can overcome exaggerated positions both here and there. Over the last few days, the Lisbon Summit has highlighted aspects of the development and future viability of Europe which deserve support. We want to support these aspects in the coming budget and concentrate our efforts on these areas. At the same time, we here in Parliament recognise the need for an economical and efficient budget. The objectives which I mentioned, in which we, the Council and the Commission have a common interest in numerous cases, can only be achieved if we approach the budgetary procedure in an atmosphere of trust and partnership. This means avoiding an escalation of the conflict surrounding the financing of external actions at all costs. So let us use the discussion of the forthcoming Commission proposal for a multiannual programme which has been scheduled for the coming weeks in order to find a viable solution which secures our ability to act in the foreign policy area without impeding our internal priorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting down to serious business now, for this is about our money, or the European Union’s revenue to be precise. The discussions we are having today on reforming the system of own resources are directly related to the discussions we had and the decisions we reached in the spring of this year. I would like to draw your attention to the Commission’s comprehensive report, which presents a thorough analysis of own resources and has presented many of the options for reform which come up in discussion. We established our position on the own resource system, as a Parliament in March, with full knowledge of this report and following very full discussions. Unfortunately, the Berlin Council was unable to reach agreement on an actual reform step but contented itself with the kind of haggling for which it has long been famed. The outcome of the Berlin conclusions has been further complication of the own resources system and restriction of the European Union’s financial room for manoeuvre. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. We must put an end to the situation in which each Head of Government and Finance Minister in the Council only has the short-term interests of their own country at heart when it comes to planning our revenue, regardless of the consequences. This Community can only be sustained and developed if our common interests as a whole and our longer-term aspirations are taken account of, and if we are prepared to invest in this. In this connection, it is the Council’s policy in particular that merits condemnation, for it persists in committing expenditure at international donor conferences, the burden of which falls to the European budget, without ensuring that the corresponding revenue is in place. That being the case, the Council is not taking its dealings with the European Union’s revenue very seriously – and that is putting it mildly – and it may, in the forthcoming enlargement process, become a real handicap capable of obstructing our opportunities for development. However, I am also disappointed with the proposal put forward by the Commission on changing the own resource system. Of course, we are not under any illusions; we too are aware that the Council was not about to perform a dramatic about-turn at some point from the spring onwards, and initiate far-reaching reform. Obviously, I recognise that where our proposals are concerned, the Commission, as must we as a Parliament, has to take into account the mood in the Council and the positions adopted there if we want to achieve a workable outcome. Nevertheless, the Commission could have done more, in fact I would go so far as to say that it should have done more. It has trailed snail-like behind the Council, only to now place before us as a proposal something that follows the Council’s agreement to the letter. But it is also the role of the Commission to be the driving force of integration; at the very least, it must fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties, warding off any regulations which could damage the Community. In my view, it has failed to do so in the case of the present proposal. However, I would not want to spare us as a Parliament a certain amount of self-criticism either. We too could have been more courageous in our demands in respect of reform of the own resources system, and ought to have paid less attention to the discussions taking place at national level. At all events, we are going to have to be more consistent in the next round of reforms – which ought not to be too long in coming – if we want to ensure that the Union still has the financial power to act after enlargement and once it has additional tasks. That is why we want to commit the Commission to making the schedule tighter than it envisaged doing in its report. Allow me to make clear in a few points the work that we can and must get under way if we are to change the own resource system in such a way that it will also be possible for there to be progress towards reform. Firstly, planning the European Union’s revenue must be undertaken in accordance with a number of fundamental principles, without which the system would be unable to function indefinitely. This means that we need a system that is transparent, uniform and balanced. In the long-term there must be a direct link between the citizens of Europe and the European Union’s financing of its expenditure, and for the benefit of those individuals who are now calling again for there to be an increase in taxation, I would like to make quite plain that of course there must be no increase in the overall tax and contributions burden borne by the citizens, but then that was the position we took up back in March as well. In the foreseeable future, as long as the budget is financed by the Member States, this principle means in practice that financing must take place under the same conditions for all concerned. There must be no more derogations or rebates in the future. We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have reached agreement on this demand, and that includes those individuals from Member States that continue to benefit from such derogations or are hoping to benefit from them soon. It represents a great step forwards and I am very proud of it. Indeed, I would call upon all the groups to support this compromise, which will be presented to them in the form of an amendment. Secondly, securing and consolidating our financial power to act also means acquiring new forms of revenue that we can truly call our own and that will replace the previous ones. But above all, it means not tampering with the only sources of income that are truly ours, that are the Union’s by right, that is to say, our traditional own resources. But this is exactly what will happen if the Commission’s proposal is implemented. If the refund – to be retained by the Member States – of the costs associated with the collection of these traditional own resources were to be increased by 150% then such fears would certainly be justified. Unfortunately, the majority in the Committee did not support my request to leave this refund at 10%. Personally speaking though, I am able to warmly endorse the present draft amendment, expressive as it is of the desire not to raise the amounts Member States are permitted to retain to 25%, for this would leave the traditional own resources intact. Thirdly, if there is to be transparency, balance and manageability then the basis for financing must be unambiguous. The essential pillar as far as the current financing framework is concerned, is the gross domestic product of the Member States. This must continue to be the case for as long as the EU is financed by the Member States, for any other method would distort the system and render it illogical. The own resources ceiling of 1.27% expresses what proportion of gross domestic product has to be devoted to the European budget. This figure has become a politically reliable basis for cooperation based on partnership between Parliament and the Council. That is why it must be maintained and must not be changed arbitrarily. These are a few aspects of the proposal I am putting to you concerning changes to the own resources system. Unfortunately, there is no possibility of doing more at the present time since we have only limited room for manoeuvre in our actions. The consultation procedure in force here and, above all, the restrictive framework created by the Berlin Council’s agreements mean that we can only be moderate in our dealings. I would ask you all though, to at least give me your support as far as these draft amendments are concerned. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I actually wish we had been able to have an open debate in this House on optimising the way in which Europe’s Capital of Culture is chosen. Instead, we have to deal with what has to be called some kind of emergency solution or repair job. It has been said, and quite rightly, that it was utterly egoistic of the Council to come to a snap decision to make use of all the present Member States by 2019, in the full knowledge that we would have unification to deal with, in the shape of enlargement. Now that enlargement is imminent and it has dawned on some people that it cannot be right and proper to put these countries off until 2020 or even later, the Commission has now come up with this tandem solution– and a solution it is, although I have to tell you, Commissioner, that it does of course leave a disagreeable aftertaste. I think you are aware of that too. I will readily concede, though, that you have tried to make the best of it, and it really is a great shame that we in this House are in two minds about it and that opinions differ on it, with the result that the proposals Mr Rocard has made in his report on the qualitative improvement of the selection procedure cannot be discussed in isolation from the question of what actually happens if fundamental changes are made. I am a German MEP. In Germany, 17 cities are seeking to be the Capital of Culture for 2010. We are told that nobody wants to interfere with this. What legal certainty, though, is there for these cities if the procedure cannot be completed? They have applied and are engaged in a contest that I believe can point the way ahead. The only real recommendation I can make for the future is that a competition be held within the Member States, with the Member State making a qualitative decision, which would then be taken up to European level, where I would like to see a competitive selection procedure. I hope that the new Parliament can do some fundamental new thinking about this.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been a Member of this House for fifteen years, and for fifteen years, my group has been demanding the budgetisation of the EDF. It is an untenable situation that a fund with an overall budget of this level is not subject to any democratic parliamentary control. I believe it is essential to establish this control. Mr Scarbonchi's report identifies an adequate range of options to safeguard this control without inflicting any damage on the ACP countries, because special consideration must undoubtedly be given to ensuring that no ACP country is put at a disadvantage. Until now, the Council has been engaged in a kind of poker game over this issue, which is why the entry into force of the 9th EDF was delayed until 2003. It is absolutely essential that Parliament, in partnership and cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, should be able to exert its influence. Implementing the objectives defined in the Cotonou Agreement must naturally be given priority, but the European Parliament can exercise accountability towards the public as well, which has not happened before. Let me sum up some of the demands set out in the report and which are indispensable: firstly, to safeguard the principles of partnership with the ACP countries, which I think is a given; secondly, to establish legal certainty and predictability, especially for the poorest of the poor, by which is meant the least developed countries, who – with some justification – are concerned that they may go away empty-handed. The task is to facilitate medium-term financial planning and not cling to the principle of annuality, which would make longer-term development cooperation impossible. Above all, of course, as various speakers have said, levels of development funding for ACP countries must be guaranteed. Even more important, however, is to prevent these funds being siphoned off to meet needs elsewhere. Instead, the resources must genuinely be committed to, and available to, the ACP countries and their use must be agreed with them on the basis of partnership. Provided that these criteria are met, I believe we will also clear up any preconceptions and reservations. To this end, we are hoping for support not only from the Commission but also, and above all, from the Council.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in the 1990s that the great UN conferences gave new impetus to international cooperation and in particular to the relations between the poor and the wealthy countries in the world. Among them was the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, held in September 1994. Its tenth anniversary, which is almost upon us, cannot fail to be an occasion for drawing up a review of what has become of the ambitious Programme of Action, which the considerable number of 179 states voted to adopt. If I may anticipate the rest of my speech, the result is somewhat disappointing when measured against the claims made for it then. It was in Cairo that population development was first bracketed with global development and core development policy objectives, whereas population growth had formerly been dealt with as a wholly separate issue, and birth control and family planning had not been considered in relation to society as a whole. Doing this for the first time was Cairo’s principal achievement. It chose as its primary objectives the eradication of poverty, sustainable economic growth, educational opportunities for all population groups, especially for girls and women, gender equality and equal rights for men and women, protection, support and encouragement for the family, facilitation of general access to reproductive health, family planning and sexual health services, and a reduction in infant, child and maternal mortality rates. The Cairo Action Programme placed the right – and I emphasise the right – to reproductive health and family planning at the heart of a new understanding of population policy, and so it is on this that my report focuses. It will be clear from the appended statistics how dire is the situation of women in developing countries as regards their reproductive health and the continuing high death rates among infants, children and their mothers. Let me give you some details of the misery of women around the world. Every year, one million women die as a result of infections of the reproductive organs, including sexually transmitted diseases, but excluding HIV/Aids. Every minute, though, ten people are infected with the HIV virus, half of them being under 24 years of age. Every minute, a woman dies as a result of complications associated with pregnancy. Every year, 175 million women become pregnant, and, of those, at least 75 million do not want to be. Every minute, some 100 pregnancies are terminated, 40 of them unsafely carried out by persons with no medical training. Every year, 70 000 women die as a result of botched terminations. Let me say, for the avoidance of misunderstanding, that termination of pregnancy cannot, of course, be a family planning method, but if women are in dire need and have no other way out, then they must be enabled to have a safe termination. According to a well-known African doctor, ‘If as many young men were dying each day, about 1 450 per day or 529 000 per year, from causes that were largely preventable, it would be a matter for the Security Council.
’ The risks involved, though, are far from equal. In developing countries, complications arising from pregnancy and birth are the main cause of death and disablement for women of child-bearing age. To put it another way, the risk of dying during pregnancy or as a result of it is 150 times greater for women south of the Sahara than it is for women in Europe. In Denmark, a woman dies for this reason every four months; in Afghanistan, it is every 26 minutes. I could give many other comparisons. These data should throw into relief the urgent need for action across the board, to which the signatory states at Cairo committed themselves to the tune of billions. Most of them have failed to follow this commitment through; not even one-half of the sum promised has actually been produced, although the developing countries have, in percentage terms, done more to meet the targets than have the countries of the North. The United Kingdom has just given us a good example of how to do it by increasing from GBP 4.5 million to GBP 6 million its funding per annum for the UN’s family planning programme. This is also a response to President Bush’s restrictive policy, which has sparked protests around the world. Recently too, the Commission on Population and Development of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC, has also come to the conclusion, looking back at Cairo, that population and reproductive health are highly important issues that must therefore form part of development programmes and strategies to combat poverty, and that this would be the only way to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. That is in line with the conclusions in my report, which are addressed to the Commission, for European development cooperation, too, must actively help every couple and every individual to avail themselves of the fundamental right to good health and the free exercise of their own responsibility in determining the number of children they will have and the age at which they will have them. For over 90 years, the International Women’s Day has been a day of political campaigning for women’s rights. In Europe, too, there is – as we have heard – still much to be done, but we European sisters must admit that we are lamenting from something of a great height; what we have achieved, most women in developing countries can only dream of. International Women’s Day must make us more aware of the need for international solidarity. The message of my report on Cairo ten years on to the women of the South is that their European sisters are standing alongside them. Even there, the rays of hope are multiplying. Which of the world’s parliaments do you think has the highest proportion of women members? Finland’s? Sweden’s? Neither has anything to be ashamed of, but Rwanda’s, with over 48%, does better than either. This gives us grounds for hope.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Graça Moura has submitted a report that shows how the school can indeed provide public access to culture. As you rightly pointed out though, Commissioner, there is a large gap between the theory that we have before us and the practice in European schools. In order to close this gap, we need to be more aware that in our changing and complex times, schools play a crucial role in creating cultural openness. This does not mean that we disregard the national cultural heritage, rather it means creating a wider cultural openness in which we live together beyond the bounds of borders and without hostility having a chance even to arise. Looking back upon my own school days, I have a very clear memory of a school exchange that took place with Sweden. At that time, the war had just ended and Germany was not a popular country. The Swedes were however willing to engage in a cultural dialogue with school pupils from my country. This left a lasting mark upon me, and I think this is the right way to go about it, so, in the amendments I have tabled – and which have happily been approved – I emphasise that today more than ever before the school is a place of intercultural dialogue. In my day we did not have any Turks or Italians at school. Today however, it is quite normal for there to be a mixture of different nationalities and this represents a great opportunity for intercultural dialogue and for conveying values such as respect for others and equality in spite of differences. This idea is reflected in the report and we must endeavour to see that it is implemented. These fine words must not be left to stand alone; those who are responsible for the education policy in their country must now make them their own. Commissioner, you pointed out that families have a part to play here, and this is also something that I have taken up. It is imperative for parents to work with the school and to have some personal involvement so that the overall concept finds support from everyone. And finally, I hope that this report will be approved by the majority and will eventually be transposed into policy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cambodia, I am sorry to say, is certainly not making progress. In the elections the Cambodian population showed greater political and democratic maturity than was demonstrated by the country’s leading political forces. And incidentally, Mr Mann, not only politicians from the Sam-Rainsy party are being shot dead in the streets; my research has revealed that three members of the governing Funcinpec party have met with the same fate. In other words, rather rough customs prevail, and the normal rules of etiquette for dealings between Government and Opposition are not observed, which means that anyone who has made himself unpopular for whatever reason is in grave danger. It is, in fact, the case that impunity continues to act as an incentive to eliminate unpopular politicians, whatever their origins, because the assassins do not have to face the consequence of their actions. Public trust in politics has been seriously damaged. Even on the odd occasion when a person is charged, nobody normally believes that he is the real murderer. As well as having a huge impact on morale in the country, this situation also severely restricts the flow of international aid. The Asian Development Bank does not intend to resume its payments unless the new Parliament, which was, of course, elected some time ago, is convened soon and a new government is formed. This is actually the crux of the problem, and influence must be exerted to change the situation. At the time of the peace process, the UN specified that a two-thirds majority was required for a party or coalition of parties to form a government. Parties are now unwilling to assemble the broad coalitions that would fulfil this requirement. In practice, it has become a barrier to normal political life in Cambodia. This is where influence must be exerted to create political conditions that are truly conducive to improvement. This is the spirit in which the planned delegation should conduct its talks.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, but above all Mrs Echerer, congratulations on the Sisyphean task that I am sure this report has been. That was inevitable with such a many-facetted subject, but its success is a tribute to you. We do not always have so large a consensus in this Parliament, and that shows that people have now become more aware of the problems. I will illustrate this with a few figures. When it comes to child pornography on the Internet, the media are full of headlines and leaders. But far less attention is paid to economic crime. If artists’ rights are ignored and they are denied the fair income to which they are entitled, that is also an aspect of economic crime. An economic loss of 5% of Gross National Product has been mentioned here; broken down into individual areas, it looks like this: 25% of audiovisual industry output is counterfeit, with sound recordings accounting for as much as 40%. It has become a lucrative market for organised crime. It is not simply a matter of lawbreaking by individuals becoming widespread. As is rightly described in detail here, it is also due to excessively lax and at any rate very different laws in the various Member States, which encourage such product piracy and use of counterfeits. The result is economic loss on a tremendous scale – lost tax revenue, lost jobs, lost investment confidence, which can be seen in the music industry in particular, but it also means lost rights for people like you and me, namely a loss of consumer protection, a loss of young people’s welfare and the like, and in the end it is also a threat to cultural diversity. It follows that a uniform legal basis for the protection of intellectual property is long overdue. The collecting societies that have already been mentioned many times have a particular part to play here, especially in light of the changed market conditions that we find in the information society. How that can and should be done is described in detail in the report, which also contains the opinions from the other committees. As a member of the Committee on Culture, I think it is particularly important to stress that the collecting societies are not simply a kind of protective association, but that they always have a cultural function as well, regardless of how they are organised. The protection and exploitation of rights in intellectual property help to promote culture and cultural diversity, so the Committee on Culture is right, in its opinion, to call on the Commission to pay particular attention to this aspect.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we now come to yet another extraordinarily sad topic for debate. Haiti was once seen as a glimmer of hope for slaves taken from Africa to America, who were able to join together in establishing a free republic there. Today, 200 years after Haiti achieved independence, we cannot but note that it is poor, broken-down and wracked by violence as never before, and those who have seen the place first-hand can only sink into pessimism. I have met the present President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on two occasions. The first was a number of years ago, when he was still regarded as the shining light of potential democratisation in Haiti. Those who had turned out in large numbers to elect him by a large majority had believed that, having been freed from the dictatorship of Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier, they would now be able to have a new life in a bright future. This, unfortunately, turned out to be a great mistake, and he too was driven out of office. During his exile, we covertly smuggled him into the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Santo Domingo, for we too believed that Haiti could have a good future under Aristide. My second meeting with him was after the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, when I had the honour of leading a delegation that the Committee on Development and Cooperation sent to Haiti. It was apparent from this encounter that we are dealing with a man who no longer has any idea where he is coming from, but that is not, in my view, the worst of it. We are dealing with someone whose views are akin to fascism – there is no other way of putting it – and who treats all democratic institutions with utter contempt. So it is that Haiti has, for the past three days, again been without a parliament, as the term of office for the deputies expired on 12 January and there is no prospect of new elections. There are, admittedly, still a handful of senators in the second chamber, but that does not legitimise anything. What we are seeing here is a failure to hold elections, the falsification of ballots, the intimidation of the electorate, of whom – as was apparent the last time – only some 5% turn out to vote, most preferring to stay at home where they feel safer. Such is day-to-day political life in Haiti. It is not always possible to separate political and criminal forces. Death squads dispose of those opposition elements who incur the regime’s displeasure, and journalists who try to maintain something like standards of independent reporting are persecuted and even killed. I could go on in this vein for hours. We will have to support those forces that are combating these abuses; the caravans of hope are coming together. We should be supporting these forces in the hope that things in Haiti may take a turn for the better. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will confine myself to making a number of comments about HIV/AIDS. Although a great deal has already been done, it is certainly not enough, and in the long term, the costs will be higher if we fail to act than if we provide massive assistance now and spend what sounds like a lot of money. However, HIV/AIDS is not just a health problem. HIV/AIDS is a threat to society as a whole. The death toll from AIDS reverses the modest successes achieved in the past. In a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, life expectancy is falling dramatically. Men and women of working age are dying in increasing numbers, and this leads to educational deficits, for there are regions where the number of teachers dying of AIDS is higher than the number of new teachers who can be trained to replace them. The result is a drop in the standard of education. This is exacerbated by the fact that young girls are no longer able to attend school because they have to care for their parents who are sick with AIDS. In Swaziland, for example, school attendance among girls has fallen by 36%. HIV/AIDS also causes malnutrition and starvation, for a rural population which is sick cannot cultivate its fields, or can only do so to a limited extent. In Burkina Faso, agricultural production has therefore fallen by almost a fifth. Millions of children are orphaned, facing an uncertain future. These examples could be continued ad infinitum
. They show that HIV/AIDS worsens the plight of the poor immeasurably. To put it another way, every euro spent on prevention, treatment and healthcare infrastructure is worthwhile, not only to benefit the individuals but also to boost economic and social capacities. To this end, the EUR 1 billion being demanded is money well spent.

 Madam President, most of the African countries that have adopted the NEPAD initiative are ACP countries. This offers the Commission the opportunity to support the NEPAD initiative on the basis of partnership through its cooperation with the ACP. It also offers the European Parliament the opportunity, through the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to engage in regular dialogue with the relevant countries about their needs and, indeed, the successes achieved. The new parliamentary committees established by the ACP Assembly offer an excellent forum for this process, enabling problems to be addressed on the basis of critical solidarity. Through their initiative, the NEPAD countries have undoubtedly laid the foundation stone for successful development based on individual responsibility. The task now is to establish a sound basis for fruitful cooperation and create a pan-African house in which every individual finds a home worthy of human dignity. Achieving peace in crisis regions is a basic prerequisite for improving living conditions in large parts of Africa. In order to achieve long-term successes, especially in combating poverty, lasting political stability is essential. This can only be achieved on a reliable basis if those who bear political responsibility secure the support of civil society. That means that there must be active, democratic and pluralist participation by the key groups from civil society: the non-government organisations as well as the political bodies and associations, the trade unions as well as employers’ organisations, and the churches as well as cultural associations and education bodies, to cite just a few examples. There is a particular need for women’s equal participation in designing projects and strategies for development, for they are the key figures who organise daily life, and they are often responsible for ensuring their families’ survival as well. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address one particular issue where there has so far been no protection of cultural diversity in the way this Parliament would wish, and where this situation is likely to continue. I am referring to the concentration of electronic media, especially television, which, as we know, is the key medium influencing public opinion. Protecting media diversity is also an important element in protecting cultural diversity and cultural identity. We cannot leave the task of affording this protection to the European judicial system, gratifying though today’s judgment by the Italian constitutional court may be. My earnest expectation of the international legal instrument that we hope for is that it will establish conditions which genuinely help to promote diversity in the media. Commissioner, you have been talking about battles and wars, and we have a major battle on our hands here. Without wishing to play down your achievements in other areas, we have been left with no troops on this battlefield so far, and that creates a rather bitter after-taste. Diversity of opinion and pluralism in the media are valuable assets and there are many positive examples of them in Europe, despite the growing threats facing us. That is why Parliament has repeatedly, but sadly unsuccessfully, called for a directive to restrict media concentration for years. I would like to reiterate this call today. My group will therefore also be supporting a supplementary amendment by Mrs Fraisse, which sets out the arguments for this and which deserves the support of this House. I hope that it will have the Commission’s support as well.

 The World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva has barely featured on the European Parliament’s agenda beyond the insider interests of a small number of Members. Unfortunately, as a result, Parliament and, indeed, the other institutions were hardly represented – beyond the official statements by the Member States and the Commission – as active participants. The evaluation of the Geneva Summit and the ensuing implementation measures must now be geared towards the second phase of the Summit in Tunis in November 2005. For the first time at one of the major UN conferences, civil society groups were included as partners, and this proved very beneficial. The presentation by the developing countries, with multifaceted initiatives to overcome the digital divide, was impressive. Surprisingly, the ACP Council of Ministers produced an ACP/EU common position for signature. The basis for an implementation strategy, which I called for in my 2001 general report and which is long overdue, and which must focus on the social benefits for all sections of the population, has therefore finally been established. This must include the right to freedom of opinion. The Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action must be evaluated by the Commission and Parliament in terms of their implementability. At the same time, the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before Tunis, including how the Digital Solidarity Fund demanded by Senegal can developed in a sensible way.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of recent events, I should like first of all to express my joy that Amina Lawal, who had been condemned to be stoned to death in Nigeria for adultery, has won her appeal and is no longer facing this threat. I believe that the European Union also had a hand in this success, because it campaigned vigorously to ensure that this horrifying act did not happen. This gives me grounds for optimism about the willingness to debate and discuss this issue within the ACP partnership, because as you know it is one that we unfortunately have to deal with in these countries. It has, of course, been pointed out that there is no doubt that in Africa too torture is practised and that we need to address it. What has happened in Nigeria can be seen as a kind of victory for humanity, and our cooperation with the ACP countries, which is, of course, very important to us in this House, contributed to it, as did the European Parliament's resolve. This shows then that our policies can achieve real results. But to comment on the issue in general: the European Union's commitment to speak up for the respect of human rights and to guarantee the inviolability of human dignity is recognised the world over. We also spend considerable sums of money on this, but unfortunately it is never enough, given the misery prevailing in the world. That is why, on behalf of my group, I should like to speak in favour of ensuring in particular that reliable provision is made for both prevention and rehabilitation in the future. The world really is waiting for the European Union to continue to stand by what it has practised and to stick to its commitment, which cannot be expected from anywhere else. It is precisely the rehabilitation centres that have been mentioned here, both within the European Union, but also outside, that must be able to have confidence that their future is secure. They must not be allowed to get into a situation where they have as it were to live from hand to mouth and worry every year whether their work, which is tremendously important for the victims, will be able to be continued. I should like to stress here that it is not only about offering victims somewhere to stay, a shelter, but also quite specifically about giving them access to legal assistance and psychological treatment. This is particularly important for women, who are, as we know, subjected to particularly perfidious methods of torture. In Bosnia, but also in other countries, we really exposed to public attention how women are victims of rape, where rape is used as a political weapon, not only as an individual shameful act, but also as a political weapon. These women are completely broken both physically and emotionally and they need reliable support. We are called on here to offer these people real security and therefore not only to continue the European Union's policy, which must undoubtedly be welcomed, but also to develop it further. I will say it explicitly: this applies to both areas, to prevention and to rehabilitation. Some aspects clearly overlap. It is certainly right to check how cooperation is assured on an individual basis, but there should be no doubt about the European Union's commitment to providing victims of torture with a refuge here. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Perry has earned our gratitude by presenting a report demonstrating a very forward-looking perspective, and in which he has not left out the areas of conflict that undeniably exist in a dual system in which public and commercial service providers square up to each other and fight over a market comprising 155 million households in the present European Union of fifteen Member States, a figure that will further increase. There is no doubt that the directive will have to be revised if its objectives for the future are to be achieved. My Group takes the view that the Commission is too hesitant in this respect. What is in fact at stake is the safeguarding of cultural diversity, a wide range of opinions and pluralism. Whilst democratic opinion today is, in essence, shaped by television, this is no longer only the traditional television with analogue transmission. More and more, we have digitalisation to cope with. I was recently at the International Broadcasting Exhibition in Berlin, where I could see very well how consumer habits in this area are changing, and that nowadays the technical means of transmission can no longer be decisive when it comes to deciding which is the right way to draft laws for a media service. It must also be clear, however, that we need to establish a system of graduated regulation, and this is where there will be new demands placed on future legislation. Not every media service is of major importance in publicity terms, so the determinative criterion for the future must be the extent to which a media service is useful for publicity purposes and in what sense it is not. If I might put it rather loosely, it is on that basis that legislation can be drafted with varying degrees of rigour. Much will also be demanded of the rules that will have to be laid down, not only, to be sure, under the television directive, but also in parallel with it, in order to counteract the accumulation of economic power, which becomes media power and, eventually, also political power. We are dealing here with a development that makes it plain that bounds must be set at European level to contain media concentration, which does indeed endanger pluralism. As we can see from the example of Italy, national legal resources are not, in any case, sufficient.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has presented a very comprehensive report demonstrating, in an impressive and multi-faceted way, that there can be no sustainable development without good health. Poverty reduction must therefore be linked as a matter of urgency with measures to combat diseases, and great efforts are needed to build an effective healthcare system in the developing countries. In this context, we must focus first and foremost on the most vulnerable population groups, such as children, who die, as previous speakers have said, in their hundreds of thousands every year from diarrhoeal diseases. They die of infectious diseases because they are denied the vaccinations which could save them, and they fall victim to malaria – hundreds of thousands of children every year – because their immune systems are not robust enough to survive this disease. These examples show that health problems in the developing countries, especially among children, certainly do not always result from life-threatening diseases. Often, they fall victim to illnesses capable of being cured or prevented if the necessary drugs or vaccinations are available. Women, too, are especially at risk. Giving birth to many children at short intervals destroys women’s reproductive health, causing severe anaemia and increasing their susceptibility to infectious diseases. Poor food or malnutrition also undermines the health of large sections of the population – for hunger is not just hunger, it also saps the strength necessary to build a good life. It has quite rightly been pointed out, and I say this again, that sustainable development is under threat. It is true that a holistic strategy is required. It is not just primarily a matter of medical care. The scenario we are dealing with today – and this is where the campaign against tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS comes into play – is that we are dealing with diseases – AIDS in particular – which are not curable but which can be treated, thus giving people the opportunity to live for longer. Nonetheless, the fact that there is no cure for it means that we must also address the issue of prevention. This is an extremely important area, and must also be included in a holistic healthcare system. I am convinced that we can generate more support for these campaigns in many ways if we highlight the severe economic impacts sustained by countries where a large number of people are affected by these diseases. According to the statistics which I have available, in Burkina Faso, agricultural production has decreased by 16% because people are sick or have already died of AIDS and therefore can no longer work in agriculture. In Swaziland, school attendance among girls has decreased by 36% because they have to care for their parents who are sick with AIDS. Ultimately, only the grandparents will be left. This means that massive economic damage will result in these countries unless there is an effective healthcare system to help restore public health to the necessary level.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it must indeed be recalled that an entire people were traumatised by the terrible years under Pol Pot’s regime in Cambodia. Some two million people lost their lives, while an incalculable number were displaced and deported. Even the wearing of spectacles put your life at risk, and higher education meant that you were doomed. If, today, you travel through this beautiful tropical country, with its impressive stone buildings that testify to the antiquity of its culture, then, wherever you go, you still come face to face with the physical and mental damage done to a tormented people, who, first, were terrorised by the Khmer Rouge, and then put under the yoke by their Vietnamese liberators, finally achieving a small measure of normality under the UN mandate. The reason why I have been able to follow this process is that I have visited the country a number of times and was one of the many who observed the elections in 1998. I might add that nowhere else in the world are there so many households headed by a woman in comparison to those headed by a man. Even more than the women, it was their sons, husbands and brothers who fell victim to a system that held human life in contempt and in violent conflicts, including American bombs and Vietnamese landmines, which, time and time again, blew people to their deaths or left them gravely wounded – something that they continue to do. What is left is poverty, need, a people torn up by their roots, and – it has to be said – a certain willingness to resort to violence. The latter is now, of course, being manifested in the run-up to the elections, but I do believe that it has to be made clear – as has been unambiguously stated by, among others, the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia – that the situation is proving to be less hazardous than it once was, and the organisation ‘Asian Network for Free Elections’ notes a marked decrease in violence in comparison to previous elections. As regards these elections, it will be very important that we keep an eye on how things develop before they are held, for it is clear that they will not pass without any friction whatever. Nor, I believe, can we expect them to do so in view of the history on which this country can look back. If, though, we can help to strengthen the forces of democracy in it, and deeply impress upon the population the significance of democratic elections, we will have taken an important step towards creating, in this region, something of an enclave journeying towards democracy, for we have to concede that conditions in neighbouring countries are no better – indeed, they tend to be even worse. I therefore hope that Cambodia will find its way to democracy, a way to be humane and a way to renounce violence, and will be able to lead its neighbours by example. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would in fact like to put an oral amendment, or, as it might better be termed, a supplementary motion, namely that something should be inserted as Q a (new). As printed in the joint text, Q has to do with the repression of Christian groupings and of Buddhist monks, but it is worthy of note that Islamic teachers have also suffered repression. My group takes the view that, if we are to mention certain individual groups, we should also refer to all of those who suffer, or have suffered, repression. That is why we want to add to it. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has indicated to me its willingness to accept this, and I believe that the other groups are able to do likewise. I will now quote the oral amendment, of which you have the English version. It is as follows: Qa. ...

 Mr President, a never-ending drama seems to be unfolding in Burma. For years, a brutal junta has been terrorising the people of Burma, who live in extreme poverty. The regime bullies thousands of forced labourers, thousands of political detainees languish in the country’s prisons, and the President, once democratically elected with an overwhelming majority, the holder of the Nobel Prize – and also the holder of the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize – was imprisoned for years and then, after a short period in which the hope of a thin silver lining of democracy could be seen on the horizon, was arrested again on 31 May this year together with nine other members of the country’s parliament. As you have no doubt learned from the media, it is not clear how many human lives the enforced military takeover has actually cost, or what fate the Deputy Chairman of the persecuted party, the National League for Democracy, has suffered. It is possible that the President herself was injured in this latest attack. This is a really serious reversal, given that exactly a year ago the release of Aung San Suu Kyi raised hopes that the regime was ready to carry out reforms. In this spirit of hope, a political dialogue was begun, under the supervision of the UN Special Envoy Razali Ismail, but it is to be feared that on his visit, planned for tomorrow, he will be prevented from meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, and that this will result in a further hardening of attitudes. Military might, political persecution and taking away the freedom of people who, in defiance of all repressive measures, continue to fight for democracy – all these must not be tolerated. The Council has therefore been invited to reintroduce, with immediate effect, the sanctions against the regime which had been temporarily suspended. However, it must also be clear that the Council, the Commission and in particular Parliament, in the interests of the people of Burma, do not want to close all doors in Burma. In other words, we are still ready to help to encourage a process of national reconciliation, but there must also be signs that such a reconciliation process is desired and pursued by all sides. As long as terror and military might prevail, however, no one can hope for tolerance from the European Parliament and from the other European institutions. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Zimbabwe too the situation seems to be developing into a never-ending story. I myself was able to experience the escalation in violence when I visited the country on the occasion of the parliamentary elections as an election observer, albeit under the wrong label, because I was not recognised as representing the European Union. Over thirty opposition politicians lost their lives in these disputes, and we are now seeing a renewed escalation in violence. We must now face the fact that not only is Mr Mugabe using live weapons against peaceful demonstrators, but he is also using hunger as a weapon against his people. It has already been mentioned here today that over half of the population is dependent on food aid. We too, therefore, find ourselves in a quandary: if we do not want to let the people starve, we have to help them, but in so doing we are also unintentionally helping to keep Mugabe in power. Prices for essential goods are soaring in Zimbabwe. The rate of inflation is exploding, and is currently the highest in the world. The economy is in ruins; exports and tourism, once flourishing sources of income, have collapsed. The rule of law, once so dependable, has been set aside, and the most recent outrages have shown that the Council was right to agree to the sanctions against the Mugabe regime. However, those sanctions are not being consistently applied. This must be demanded as a matter of urgency! If we expect these measures to make any impression on the regime, then they must also be consistently applied. We had this problem with an ACP meeting, which broke up as a result. We shall continue to come up against this problem, and if the Commission grants a travel permit for ACP talks or other meetings, then the regime will be strengthened still further, and our position, namely that we are in favour of the restoration of the rule of law and democracy and in favour of the protection of human rights, will be weakened. This in turn weakens our position within the ACP meetings too, where we are, after all, trying to get our African partner countries on our side, and that is certainly no easy task. We have experienced many disappointments. We have even experienced the situation in which we have not received support for our position in favour of the rule of law, for the protection of human rights and finally for a life fit for human beings in that country, complete with full democratic rights. I would like to emphasise, however, that, in a secret ballot, a good quarter of those present at the ACP meeting agreed with us, and some delegates even dared to say so openly, and to condemn, very forcefully, what is happening in Zimbabwe. However, we must remind all those who sit around the table with Mugabe in Africa that to support such a regime cannot be to follow the path of legality. We need to make our position absolutely clear here, and so, too, must the Commission. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to most warmly congratulate Mrs Ferrer on her report, which has quite rightly been adopted unanimously, and in which she also addresses the significance of the new technologies, especially of the Internet. It is this point that I wish to pick out particularly in order to deal with it in greater detail. Whilst we support all the good proposals made in this report with regard to the urgent necessity of building capacity, they will be only halfway useful if the developing countries do not acquire widely-available access to modern information and communication technology, thereby leaping over the digital gulf. There are still, in New York, more telephone lines than there are in the whole of Africa. On average, people in Africa are still 50 kilometres away from the nearest telephone, let alone from the Internet. You may perhaps have read that it took three days for a recent massacre on the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia to become public knowledge, those three days being the time it took to reach the nearest telephone. What this means, in both a positive and a negative sense, is that capacity-building requires that it be possible to transmit information for such purposes as the speedy provision of help in disaster situations, for the transmission of educational material enabling great advances in capacity-building, for enhancing the competitiveness of local, regional and national economies, for empowering civil society, especially women, to improve health service provision and eventually also the development of administrative capacity, to implement innovative techniques – if I had the chance, the list could go on forever. This is a necessary aspect of any capacity-building strategy, but there is a virtually total lack of any such strategy for Africa, where the need is greatest. In this respect, the Commission owes much to the ACP countries in particular, and I wish to urge most strongly that serious consideration be given, when examining all the concepts that have been set out so well in this report, as to how the communication gap can be closed, for it is demonstrable – there are calculations to prove it – that it results in economic failure for a very large number of people. To do so will be to the benefit of the capacity-building that Mrs Ferrer has described.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleague Mr van den Berg most warmly for his splendid report and, of course, also for his other activities, such as education for all. As is set out in this report, the proportion of people who are illiterate is depressingly high in many countries, particularly in Africa, where there are few opportunities, especially in sparsely-populated areas. As it would, in desert or other uninhabited areas, be unrealistic to build a large number of schools near to where people live, we have to take a good look at other solutions to reduce the educational deficit. This is one of the things Mr van den Berg takes up in his report, proposing, for example, the setting-up of mobile schools, which are of particular importance in providing basic education. In this context too, though, I will come back to the subject of modern information and communication technologies, the use of which enables distances to be overcome, the digital gap to be crossed, and education to become more widespread. It is certain, though, that in the long term, the most important mass medium is radio, which could – and should – be even more widely used as a means of providing education than it has been so far. The example of what is done in the Australian outback can certainly not be followed exactly in African countries, but is one from which one can learn, and it too must form part of any strategy for education. I am glad that I do not have to point out the need to take especial account of girls and women in all educational endeavours. In this report, at any rate, this has become a generally accepted fact. It is not, however, generally known that education – particularly basic education – conducted in the predominant regional languages results in a marked increase in the desire for education and reduces parents’ misgivings about sending their children to school. This is where we must help with the investment in appropriate teaching material, play our part in promoting the education of teachers and contributing to the dissemination of knowledge that relates to local interests and is therefore an indispensable necessity in terms of raising the consciousness of civil society.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coffee crisis is symptomatic of the relationship between the countries of the South and those of the North. The North exploits monocultures and, in order to put itself at an advantage, helps itself to the raw materials they produce, at minimum prices, under the most adverse conditions, and in a poverty-stricken environment. Consumers' spending habits and consumer policy within the European Union also have to be borne in mind here. Policies support the consumers' desire for raw materials from developing countries at the lowest possible prices, whilst our own agricultural policies are defended with extraordinary vigour and – I am still being polite – we concentrate on keeping prices stable. It is inevitable that such an incongruity must come to an end, and this must form part of an action plan on the part of the European Union. In essence, economic relations are limited to the exploitation of raw materials, coffee being only one example of this, whilst these materials are processed and utilised, thus acquiring added value through the production process, within the industrialised countries. For as long as this incongruity persists, the economic relationship between the countries of the North and of the South will be beset by constant problems. We talk about diversification, and rightly too, for this is an important requirement, but it must also be given substance. It is not enough to consider this concept in isolation and see it as the cure for all ills. We must also ask what shape this diversification is to take, and let me make clear that this will involve the possibility of raw materials being processed in the developing country in which they were produced, where, at the very least, semi-manufactured goods should also be produced, for these are the means by which added value is created. This will also involve willingness on our part to pay a proper price for them. Where, for example, in the European Union's institutions, can you find fairly traded coffee? Where, too, in the political institutions of our Member States? In which of this Parliament's bars and restaurants is fairly traded coffee served? I could give any number of examples. Any action plan by the Commission must of necessity include a proposal as to how goods can be fairly traded under present conditions. I cannot see that there is a conclusive concept for this, one that would right now allow the farmers a truly fair share in their products if the existing fair trade infrastructure were to be put to use and extended. In this area, we owe a debt to the developing countries. I very much hope that this will meet with a response.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confine my remarks to the subject of HIV/AIDS. The World Population Report for 2002, which has just appeared, contains some shocking figures. On average, 14 000 men, women and children die of this scourge every day. It is now the commonest cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. To date, more than 60 million people worldwide have become infected and around 22 million of them have died. Of the 40 million persons infected, 95% live in developing countries and nearly three quarters of them in Africa. Out of 580 000 children below the age of 15 who have died from AIDS, 500 000 – almost 90% – lived in Africa. I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely. This catalogue of disasters is not only the sum of millions of human tragedies, however, but it is something that affects whole societies. Life expectancy is falling, education is severely affected, agricultural output is declining, and the social and economic fabric is being eroded. Plans for fighting HIV/AIDS must not be confined to the health aspects. What is needed is an integral strategy with wide-ranging education and prevention campaigns. Those who are already infected are entitled to the best possible treatment. We carry some responsibility for that. It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge, awareness and, of course, the necessary resources for prevention and treatment. Because once a person is infected, that cannot be reversed. In Sierra Leone I saw large posters on streets and squares with the blunt message: Aids kills!
 malaria and tuberculosis can be cured, AIDS cannot. AIDS can be avoided, however, and that is worth every effort. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad, but true, that if Iraq had nothing but dates, war against Baghdad would not even be on the agenda, even if the country were ruled over by a dictator. If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources, Africa would have far less in the way of problems. The United Nations report has spelled out, albeit with perhaps insufficient clarity, the shameful forms of greed that give rise to the illegal exploitation of this wealth. The global community must find ways and means of putting a stop to this exploitation. There is a lamentable lack of responsibility, not only on the part of criminal elements, but also on the part of governments who would rather line their own pockets, and also in European business circles. European enterprises must be made aware that the unscrupulous exploitation of Africa's natural resources is not a petty offence, and so Europe's policies must set a good example. Illegal actions must be punished, and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, media freedom and independence do not go well with accumulated economic power, not to mention monopolies. This is especially true when one is dealing with political power wielded by a head of government. The name to mention here is Berlusconi. The Italian media tycoon and, in one and the same person, prime minister, along with Mr Murdoch and Herr Kirch, have given the champions of unfettered press freedom a lesson in fear. That the Kirch empire has collapsed can be of little comfort in view of the pressure exerted on public service broadcasters by commercial enterprises – I am referring to the cost of rights to sporting events among other things – and in view of an increasing concentration of regional, national and worldwide media with growing cross-border involvements. Media concentration to an illicit degree endangers diversity and pluralism of opinion and the promotion of cultural diversity. Volume 44 of ‘Media Research’ a series of treatises published by the North Rhine-Westphalia Media Institute, has come out in the last couple of days; it gives a powerful description of media concentration's adverse effects on society's democratic and cultural foundations. It also has to be said without equivocation that the rule of law in Italy is in danger. It has already had the worst of the fight. All this leads to only one conclusion, namely that European regulations are needed to limit concentration in the media, because national law does not apply outside the borders of states, or also because – as in Italy – the effort is not even being made. Reference has already been made to the way the Italian State President's profound concern has led him to call for an Italian law to deprive the prime minister of practical political control over the services of the public-sector broadcaster RAI, and to restrict his power as a private individual over the media. Berlusconi is in every respect a special case, and one that it must be hoped will remain unique, involving an array of legal actions relating to tax evasion, forged documents, perjury, payments from slush funds, the bribing of judges and similar things, not all of which have been brought to a conclusion. We therefore call on the Convention to impose a constitutional ban on any such agglomeration of power, which is positively indecent. Even the Pope – or so we have heard – is advocating regulations to safeguard pluralism and freedom of opinion. That, Mr Prodi, Commissioners, is why I say it is now time for you to take some action!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Zimbabwe is quite simply an unparalleled tragedy. In his speech in Johannesburg, Mr Mugabe made the unspeakable assertion that these events, which are totally contrary to constitutional law, are even contributing to sustainable development. That really takes the biscuit! It would be hard to top that comment for audacity. It would be good if there were some louder voices in black Africa exposing this for what it really is: a power struggle on the part of a man who has failed in the course of 20 years to push forward a process of land reform that could have been carried out constitutionally. He only took action on this when his personal position was threatened, and only resorted to these tactics when his hold on power was at risk. We must never forget that this action is only partly directed again white farmers. It is above all aimed at Zimbabwe's opposition, which managed, despite enormous repression in the parliamentary elections, to achieve a very remarkable result, and which of course has a great deal of backing amongst the public. That is the real background to this. I would like to quote some comments from the South African newspaper the Daily Newspaper
, because it is one of the voices in a country which is, after all, our ally, which is important. It has criticised the way the Mugabe Government has carried out land reform as brutal, and as a means of bringing production to a standstill, which is futile. This paper has pointed out that Mr Mugabe is attempting to propagate a myth when he says he has the backing of all Zimbabweans. We know after all that there is a strong opposition and that it is not therefore legitimate, and I am quoting now, to talk about 'my Zimbabweans and my Zimbabwe', while ignoring his many opponents, and that Mr Mugabe is creating a false impression when he alleges that Zimbabwe is, as it were, his property. But as far as I understand he is in the process of selling off that property to his own family, so that the occupation of land is being misused to bestow gifts on his family members. As I have already said, the European Union should be willing to support a legal and constitutional process of land reform, but it should not support such machinations. We have to say that very clearly to our partner countries.

Mr President, the situation in Angola is indeed most tragic. From day to day, images of starving people and dying children are winging their way around the world. According to the information at my disposal, 500 000 people – half a million – are in immediate danger of death. What this makes clear is that humanitarian aid, especially food supplies, is second only to the ending of the war as a matter of priority. If the country is to be put on a stable footing, though, this will of course presuppose that the destruction of its infrastructure be ended. The consequences of the depopulation that was enforced in order to cut UNITA off from its supply lines must be dealt with. Emergency aid is a prime necessity before any process of political consolidation can be set in motion, and the establishment of peace and the conditions for successful elections both presuppose and require that this be done.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst there are perceptible signs of hope in Angola, it has to be said that the situation in Zimbabwe is being made ever more desperate by that country's obstinate President, who is incapable of letting go of the reins of power even at the cost of his country's wholesale destruction, and is thereby reducing his people to a wretched state. I want now to quote a figure supplied today by the aid agencies, one that is especially appalling, even though it is only a snapshot. Of Zimbabwe's adult population, 33% are infected with the HIV virus. From day to day, between 2 000 and 5 000 people die of this scourge; there are already 900 000 orphans in Zimbabwe, and that too is a consequence of the unspeakable policies of Mugabe and the ZANU-PF. No longer is there either prevention or treatment. Poverty makes these people's misery even worse. In this country, which once possessed a system of medical provision that was an example to Africa, there are scarcely any medical facilities left, and what provision exists is far from covering the whole country. The reason for this is that the country's doctors and nurses have fled, the hospital system has collapsed and there are no more medicines. These things are all consequences of a policy under which those with any hope for the future leave the country, and only the poor are left. The hunger there – the hunger that is spreading throughout southern Africa – is only partly a result of the drought and natural calamities that afflict such regions from time to time, but is man-made and used as a weapon. There is a need here for Europe to exert really massive pressure in the hope that sanity will yet prevail. Any such pressure, though, in fact needs also to be applied to those who now openly declare to NEPAD that they are committed to promoting good governance, the defence of human rights and democratic values. If they seriously mean that, then they can demonstrate their credibility by speaking frankly to their neighbour Mugabe, withdrawing political support from him and making it clear to him that he is isolated on a continent that is finding its way out of wretched poverty while respecting human dignity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want right now to join in the weeping and wailing over the fiasco in Bali, and I also propose to leave out the points that have already been addressed. I would like to draw attention to the core areas which, notably with the Cotonou Agreement, we have resolved to do something about, first among them being the war on poverty. That means seeing to basic services and health care, providing clean water for all, giving all children basic education, and, if possible, facilitating the participation of adults in educational programmes. Now that is not an end in itself, but rather something without which, in the final analysis, it is impossible to gain an understanding of the problems that affect every society and everyone's quality of life. Those for whom every day is a struggle for survival are not readily going to be won over by lofty objectives. It is our responsibility to liberate them from the need to spend every day in search of food. It should be noted in this context that women have a key role to play in all development, and that there must be forceful demands made in Johannesburg for us to help put women in a position to take an active part in the process of development and actively contribute to the improvement of living conditions. All over the world, it is women who support development processes that lead to changes in civil society. I would also like to mention the need to facilitate access to global communications in order to make social benefits possible. In conclusion, I will not conceal my concern at the conduct of the Spanish Presidency, which is evidently aiming to abolish the Development Council. That would send all the wrong signals to Johannesburg. (Applause)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was not in Monterrey, but I often travel in the ACP countries in Africa, where it is forcefully brought home to visitors how poor countries groan under the burden of debt. The Cologne initiative on the remission of debt, though, can help alleviate this burden and inject new resources to bring about social benefits. That is the object of the Council resolution and the Commission communication on the implementation of the HIPC Initiative. Both of these are covered by the very balanced and excellent report which Mr Mantovani has presented, which sets out the new lines on which we, representing Europe, have to focus. This, though, will not alter or reform the international financial architecture, for which there is a compelling need, quite apart from the question of how much is available in terms of resources, for there must be a paradigm shift in development cooperation, especially with the poorest countries. That will not come about if we carry on as before; rather, we too are called upon to change our approach here too.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both these reports have addressed many important issues, not all of which can be considered here, but tolerance, respect and mutual esteem always reach their limits when universal human rights are violated. The way politics works, it always involves a tightrope walk with hope on one side and despair on the other. Events in Zimbabwe at present tempt us to despair, while we can perhaps derive hope from developments in Sierra Leone. Things can, though, seem quite different the day after tomorrow. We pointed the way with our collaboration with the ACP states on the Cotonou Agreement, with its clauses on human rights and democracy, and its commitment to good governance and the rule of law. We have an instrument, even if it is not as solid as we – whose political dialogue in Parliament supports this work – might well have wished. This political dialogue, I believe, is of outstanding importance, as agreement can be reached, in the final analysis, only through discussions with each other. That is why there is also the entitlement to consultation before suspension is resorted to. Even that is not a straightforward matter, for we have to ask ourselves how we are to punish the dictatorial regime, without at the same time affecting the people. In this connection, then, I tend to go along with a proverb that is often used in Germany: ‘The impossible gets done at once, but miracles take a bit longer.’ We will have to have staying power, and I do not know whether human rights really are violated more frequently today than in the past. What is certain, though, is that crime, too, has become public. More things become known to us today, and we are of course forced to take action. The fact, though, that crime is now public and that there are almost always cameras there to record it, gives a chance of fighting things that used to remain hidden away.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to use this speech to dwell on depictions of the disadvantages under which women labour in developing countries or elsewhere, which have often been described. I believe we are familiar enough with the problem. The Commission is pursuing the implementation of the principle of gender mainstreaming – and, indeed, so is Parliament, as the two rapporteurs have reiterated. Looking, though, at the resources that are made available for this purpose, I ask myself how it is to be achieved. Gender mainstreaming is a top-down process, one that presupposes that the necessary raising of awareness and opportunities for training take place or are present within the organisations or authorities in question – in this case, the Commission. We are well aware, though, of the substantial personnel shortage that exists in this field of work. Unless there has been significant change in the meantime, we only have one national expert from Sweden who is at all involved in the area of women and development cooperation. This is a lamentable state of affairs, one that we have been complaining of for years, and we have, unfortunately, seen no changes in it to date. We do not weary of emphasising that the key to development is in the hands of women, but we have not the remotest possibility of being able even to start to put that into practice. Commissioner Schreyer, please take note of how those very people who are responsible here for development cooperation are profoundly disappointed that what we have described in many papers – and on which there is, as is well known, a programme – stands not the remotest chance of being implemented in a truly satisfactory way. There really have to be some changes here. It is also, let it be added, in Europe's interest, for if we support the empowerment of women in the developing countries, that forms part of the emancipation of the European area and will also in part alleviate the problems we still have to deal with today. If women are not empowered, if they are not given the tools for development, then development simply will not happen!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to focus on the actual task we are to perform as a European institution, but without neglecting the demands also made of the Member States. I believe that the digital age will see the acceleration of current developments in the services offered by the media, which are far from being limited to traditional television, or even to the Internet, but include many other services, and so it is right and necessary that we give thought to the legal form that control and the protection of young people might take, and also set up the means for dealing with them. There is no doubt that the legal framework must be adapted to these new developments, at both European and national level. I speak also for my group when I say that I consider self-regulation instruments to be an important addition to a legal framework. We cannot do without standards laid down in law, and these are a compelling necessity. Self-regulation instruments, too, need to be on a legal footing, which means that the promoters, those who provide the programmes, cannot be absolved of their responsibility. To put it another way, we cannot allow service providers to shirk responsibility for their programmes. That is the basic premise. As for how this can be put into practice, there may be – and indeed there are – many ways of going about that. Regulatory arrangements in the Member States are very diverse, which is ultimately due to the fact that they correspond to conventional media systems as these have evolved, and we are not about nullifying all that. I emphasise that self-regulation instruments as additions to the law are something we cannot do without. Technical systems, too, can be indispensable, but they cannot be a substitute for responsibility. We also know that many children and young people, in an age when adults have not mastered the whole range of technical options, are ahead of their parents in that respect. That will change in the long term, but that is the way things are today, and we all know that children can get up to all sorts of tricks, for example when it comes to cracking something. That is why we cannot rely exclusively on technical systems, and why there is a need for contents to be monitored, in which respect there must be restrictions on content, which cannot relate only to real-time 
transmissions. The different time zones in a region over which a satellite broadcasts make that obsolete in any case, and so even that method has serious limitations. I am very glad that this report takes up my group's call for the continuation and extension of the action plan on the safe use of the Internet, which is due to come to an end at the end of the year. I see this as compellingly necessary. I will conclude by saying that we must take steps to impart media literacy to children, young people and their parents, as a sound capacity for judgment can only come into being if our measures help to develop it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that, some dozen years ago, the National League for Democracy gained an overwhelming election victory in Burma. Since then, though, the will of the people – of all ethnic groups, let it be emphasised – has been trodden underfoot. For a dozen years, the elected president has been under house arrest, citizens who prove to be disagreeably uncooperative have been thrown into jail, forced labour convicts have been mistreated, women have been abused and ethnic minorities harassed. Trafficking in drugs, small arms and human beings are the order of the day. For a dozen years, the international community has been pressing for a return to democracy – so far, unfortunately, in vain. Yet the EU troika's indication of its willingness to enter into discussions – without, though, tying these to concessions – is right and should be welcomed. The UN Special Envoy's efforts at getting dialogue started with the elected president and the SPDC and seeking out a starting point for democratic change are particularly deserving of support. That Razali Ismail's visit, originally scheduled for March, has been delayed, gives little cause for optimism. Those who lose by this are the people in the bitterly poor country, for whom things are constantly getting worse and of whose fate the democratic part of the world must not lose sight. That it will not is also guaranteed by the European-Burmese Office, funded by the European Union and run in cooperation with the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, which has experience of promoting development and democracy. This gives us hope for new impetus to perhaps take us a bit further forward, even if we will need staying power.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Carlotti's report, a very important document on ACP-EU cooperation, has taken on a new dimension because it also presents the new possibilities open to us following the Cotonou Agreement. ACP-EU cooperation has gained a new democratic aspect, and that means that we also need to provide a new democratic dimension in shaping this cooperation. That is why the emphasis on the parliamentary nature of the Assembly presented in this report is so important. Flesh needs to be put on the bones of this idea. And that is also why it was so important for this report to be approved by this House before the session in Cape Town, so as to give us moral support for the reform of this cooperation process. We need a following wind if we are to strengthen the parliamentary dimension and to achieve what we have pledged to do. We have been told that the work on the new Rules of Procedure has not been totally without conflict – that is why it will be very important for us to have the support this report so that the negotiations in Cape Town can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. I am sure that we will be able to agree on a structure for the standing committees, which will accordingly change the nature of cooperation in this parliamentary assembly. The standing parliamentary committees make it possible to work continuously on problem areas, whereas up to now it has only been possible for us to work in ad hoc working groups. I hope that this form of cooperation will facilitate far more intensive work on various themes and closer cooperation with our colleagues on the ACP side. The regional meetings will also lend new weight to our work. They will also give a voice to other people involved in ACP cooperation who have not so far had an opportunity to have their views heard.

Madam President, hand on heart, fellow members of the European institutions: do you really believe that European competition law, specifications for the height of tractor seats or directives liberalising the electricity market make hearts leap at the thought of European integration? Surely we need something else the people in our Member States can identify with. Cultural exchanges and cultural life can bring about a plethora of positive results, far more than a disputed regulation can. The cultural heritage and cultural diversity of Europe should have been mainstreamed in Community policy since the Maastricht Treaty, ever since the word culture appeared in the Treaties. So much for the theory. In practice, the Member States jealously guard their national and regional cultural sovereignty. The Council insists on the principle of unanimity on cultural affairs, tiresome conciliation procedures are the order of the day and low-level agreements and infuriating delays the consequence – witness Culture 2000. The budget is and always has been derisory. At 0.04% all in, cultural expenditure represents a sliver rather than a slice of the European budget. It is soul-destroying for artists to know that there is a 90% probability of their application being rejected – however convincing their idea – because fewer than 10% of applications stand a chance of being rubberstamped. And it is not much fun for us Members of the European Parliament to keep dashing hopes as we turn down applicants by the dozen. No one wants to rob the Member States of their authority but a bit more openness would not go amiss. Unfortunately, it is not even to be found in the practical implementation of Culture 2000. As we have already said, crippling bureaucracy and delays with payments, which are ruinous for organisers, make life unnecessarily difficult for applicants, to mention just two of the criticisms. In the final analysis, what we also lack is a consistent material concept which answers the question: exactly what is the purpose of the aid? To stage major events to reach as many people as possible in one go? Or to give as many artists as possible the opportunity to work in other countries? Mainstream culture has a much easier time of it. But the way to people's hearts is to support less established artists, networks and private initiatives. That is what creates European added value. The European Union is the most powerful economic area in the world. We gladly brag about that with undisguised pride. But the European Union is also a cultural area of immeasurable diversity. We should be making broad strokes, not fiddling about at the edges, and not just with Culture 2000. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I might anticipate the result, the Group of the Party of European Socialists can support the Cotonou Agreement with conviction, even though nothing is so good that it cannot be improved still further. The tightly allocated speaking time unfortunately does not permit a comprehensive appreciation of the Agreement, and I am therefore obliged to limit myself to a few aspects of it. The Cotonou Agreement represents the unbroken continuation of European cooperation with the developing states of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which began with the Yaoundé Agreement and has since 1975 been expanded by a total of four Lomé Agreements. The parties to Lomé I were just 46 ACP countries and nine Member States of the then European Community. The Cotonou Agreement now joins together 77 ACP States and 15 countries of the EU. Even more important, though, than the geographical expansion is the broader basis with regard to content. The collapse of the blocs and the associated political upheavals across the world, including in the ACP States, meant that the political dimension became more significant, as did trade policy. The treaty comprises such important matters as the safeguarding of human rights and the application of the principles of democracy and the rule of law, responsible governance and the strengthening of civil society, failure to observe which may be met with sanctions. The political dialogue established by the Cotonou Agreement and the obligation, equally embedded in the Agreement, to work for the consolidation of peace and the prevention and settlement of conflict, along with the declared aim of combating poverty, are important instruments of ACP cooperation, although unfortunately not a guarantee of its success. To demonstrate this, it is enough to refer to Sudan, the Horn of Africa, the Congo, Zimbabwe, Islamic fundamentalism and HIV/AIDS. Parliament's monitoring of ACP cooperation is an example to the world. The Cotonou Agreement has given it a new value, enhancing both its parliamentary character and its role as an open forum for discussion and a monitoring institution. This, too, is part of the new quality of the Cotonou Agreement, and it, too, makes it easy for us, as a Group, to support this Agreement. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is painful to have to stand by as a stubborn president, who has also earned a great deal of credit, uses unscrupulous party activists to help him systematically ruin a country, with no scruples about using deadly force in the process, because he cannot come to terms with the threat of losing power. Like Mr Gahler, I was one of the parliamentary election observers at the time and saw for myself how Mugabe and his rent-a-mob were driving the country straight towards catastrophe. Despite massive attempts to intimidate the electors – and we shall no doubt see an action replay of that now – and despite massive support for the opposition candidates, which has ended in death in a multitude of cases, the MDC achieved a remarkable result, clearly signalling to Mugabe that political change was on the horizon. Now, with presidential elections imminent, Mugabe is again tightening the screw of force and terror. There is no sign of the return to the rule of law promised in the Abuja agreement; on the contrary. By using more and more legislative repression, massively restricting the freedom of the press, threatening the opposition, continuing to occupy farms and permanently undermining the rule of law, Mugabe is isolating himself more and more, including from his traditional allies in southern Africa. This was blatantly obvious at the last meeting of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Brussels in October. These countries are being sucked into free fall by the humanitarian and economic disaster in Zimbabwe and further pressure is needed to make Robert Mugabe change direction and hold the presidential elections in accordance with the standards of free and fair elections, and this is where we also need the support of the institutions of the European Community.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the praise, in which I, of course, wish to join, there are still some large flies in the ointment, which have indeed already been mentioned. I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with responsibility for consideration of the authorisation and radio spectrum directives, and also as my group's shadow rapporteur on the framework directive. All these reports have been adopted unanimously in the Cultural Committee, and we have managed to bring substantial points from our position to bear in the leading Committee as well. In the Council, on the contrary, all the Committee's concerns have been utterly cast to the winds, which it would be an understatement to describe as disappointing. To get to the point: even though the package of directives we are discussing is called the ‘telecoms package’ for the sake of brevity, it must be clearly pointed out that it certainly does not deal only with telecommunication issues in the strict sense of the word. Technical convergence does indeed mean that electronic services cannot be divided up by reference to their channels of distribution or the devices used to receive them, but this is specifically, in our view, about digital television and other services related to journalism. What matters to the Committee on Culture, therefore, is that the whole wide range of Europe's cultural diversity should find a place on the networks and not be merely subject to the laws of the market and of competition. This means that we see the issue of interoperability, like that of obligations to transmit, as being essential. By these means alone will Member States and participants in the market have the legal security to guarantee services of general interest and only thus will the provision of the full range of services for everyone be guaranteed in terms of both supply and demand. It is self-evident that Europe, for its part, does not have a duty to regulate the content of transmissions, but it is obliged to see to it that culture is not beaten into submission by commerce. The bottom line is that doing without interoperability does not only impose limits on culture, but positively militates against the internal market. So the Council's compromise is inadequate in every way, and we assume that there will be more change in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in and around Afghanistan have obscured our view of trouble spots in other parts of the world, for example in Nigeria. The European Union should not, however, be indifferent to what is happening in this the most populous country in Africa. At the beginning of this year, the President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo, declared that 2001 would be the year in which the Nigerian people would reap the rewards of the transition to democracy. We supported this statement when we met at that time in Abuja in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The trust has, however, suddenly turned to deep concern. A split in the ruling party in Nigeria, the absence of economic improvements and the persistence of poor living conditions have made people increasingly willing to resort to violence, thus creating a breeding ground for political extremists. To keep them in check, President Obasanjo felt it necessary to deploy soldiers in seven Nigerian states. Since then more than 3 000 people are said to have been killed and there is renewed fear that the military might return to power. The introduction and application of Sharia law in an increasing number of states has heightened religious and ethnic tensions. Violent criminals often go unpunished. The President and all of the forces of democracy in Nigeria are called upon to take determined action against violent criminals using the legal means at their disposal, to secure respect for universal human rights and to hurry through economic reforms which will benefit all parts of the country, if there is to be an end to this misery. We expect the Commission to monitor this process actively and to do everything within its power to ensure that this trouble spot in Africa once again becomes a place of democracy.

The Vander Taelen report announces the European Parliament's intention to promote the European film industry and reinforce it against the strength in the market of its American competition. This concern also meets with the approval of the Group of Socialist MEPs, who have therefore voted in favour of the report, although they have substantial reservations about the statements made under item 8. This is an attempt, detached from the debate just beginning on revision of the 'television without frontiers' directive, to force the amendment of one point in a particular direction, one highly dubious from the point of view of content and law. Cultural, and therefore broadcasting, sovereignty belongs to the Member States alone. Item 8 would in practice mean massive interference in the programming autonomy of both public-service and private-sector broadcasters. It would, over and above that, offend against the authority of national public-service broadcasting organisations enshrined in the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The success, or lack of it, of European audio-visual productions is not determined by extending protectionist measures, but by the marketability and competitiveness of such productions. There is no doubt that a structural weakness is revealed by the fact that it is exceptional for European audio-visual works to cross the borders of their country of origin. Consideration should therefore be given to systems of incentives for the distribution of non-national European films. The restrictions described in Item 8 are, however, the wrong way to go about it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, HIV and AIDS are not only a health policy problem, but a general social problem. This has been made quite clear during today's debate. A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them. Tackling poverty is one approach, but I would like to focus on other priorities which I believe are equally important: information and education, prevention, and of course treatment. These are the three areas which must be considered if we want to make progress, particularly in Africa, where the problem is most acute. This means providing information and sex education for children and young people, for without a change in sexual behaviour, the problem cannot be mastered. A proportion of the available resources must therefore be allocated for this purpose too. The sexually active population must have the opportunity to practise prevention. I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example, where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention. A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda. If politicians and a country's spiritual leaders work together on this issue, a great deal can be achieved. The Côte d'Ivoire, for example, has therefore appointed a Minister for AIDS and HIV. I believe that these are models which deserve our support. There is another important problem, which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized. This is a major problem. We must dismantle social taboos and not only ensure that those who are living with infection receive the medication they need, but also encourage their positive integration into society. This is the only way to create a climate which ultimately halts the spread of disease in a holistic way. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2000 there were 152 households in the European Union with television sets able to receive over 580 different channels. That implies a growth of around 180% in just four years. These figures alone should be enough to illustrate that the conventional television market, which only covers a small part of the overall audio-visual sector, is a major growth sector. The Commission report shows that the Television without frontiers directive, which was originally highly controversial in my own country in particular, has proved its worth. It provides sensible conditions for international broadcasting. In the period covered by the report, 50 channels were already aiming chiefly at markets outside their local area. The TWF directive closed various regional legal gaps and created binding standards for areas including advertising and the protection of minors, thus creating a level playing field in terms of equal opportunities and competitiveness. I welcome the way the Hieronymi report sets all this out. However, it also makes it clear that we need to embark as quickly as possible on a new review of the TWF directive, if we are to keep pace with the fast-moving developments in the audio-visual sector in a time of increasing digitalisation. That applies not only to the provision of all kinds of multimedia services, it also involves an appropriate approach to the trend in concentration of the media, which is also progressing at a pace that is hard to follow. The other side of the coin is the need to ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and pluralism, and to establish an essential multimedia foundation to promote European cultural diversity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, female genital mutilation inflicts endless pain and suffering on women and girls in at least 25 African countries, most of them ACP countries. Women are the victims of violent and life-threatening cultural traditions which must be ended, for a tradition which violates individual rights – in this case women's rights – in a truly horrific way must not be allowed to continue in the twenty-first century. Thankfully, the ACP countries in Africa are increasingly recognising this fact. It is gratifying that Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Uganda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic and the Côte d’Ivoire have legislated against female genital mutilation. Efforts are also being made – with the support of aid organisations and numerous NGOs – to stop this dreadful practice through public information campaigns and awareness-raising. In this context, a resolution adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at its last meeting in Libreville (Gabon), Ms Bonino, should be emphasised in positive terms. Supported by the representatives of the ACP countries, the resolution called unanimously on the authorities to take the necessary steps to end this practice, adopting all appropriate legislative, administrative and judicial measures and launching cultural awareness and information campaigns. The meeting thus branded the practice as a human rights violation. This is a great improvement on the earlier taboos surrounding this issue, and we must pay tribute to it. However, the battle to protect the physical and mental integrity of women in the ACP countries and elsewhere is still not won. Our solidarity and support are still needed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kinnock's report is a huge achievement and is to be welcomed unreservedly. The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries. There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education. There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address. The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms. Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect. That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books. Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away. You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert. They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example. This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations. The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions. The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally. Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback. In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit. It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Niebler has done a brilliant job with this very difficult subject, which I had to deal with on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. No one will deny that, in view of developments in technology, a new regulatory framework on frequency policy is needed. However, certain basic principles have to be borne in mind here, since although the technology itself is neutral, the way it is used is not. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose unanimous opinion I am presenting here, has, amongst other things, considered how it can be guaranteed that adequate transmission capacity is reserved for content addressed to the general public. In other words, in addition to economic issues, consideration also has to be given to political, cultural and social aspects, and also to the right to privacy and to consumer protection. This applies first and foremost to broadcast programming content relating to the expression of cultural diversity, freedom of speech and pluralism, which therefore plays a significant part in shaping opinion as part of the democratic process. This is all the more important given that the proposal quite rightly stresses the fact that radio frequencies are a scarce resource and that this will not change in the longer term. It would therefore be wrong to place too much emphasis on economic efficiency. Products geared to the general public should also have a guaranteed place in an open competition-oriented market for electronic communication networks and services. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has not entirely taken on board the views of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport in this respect, as we would have wished, but it does recognise the principle of freedom of speech, and this is a key reason why we are willing to vote for the report as it stands. It is also emphasised elsewhere that democratic, social and cultural interests connected with frequency use need to be taken into account. The Member States should also be expected to comply with that requirement, including Italy – please note, Mr Berlusconi.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, it is important to remember that the European Union delegations originated with the delegate controllers who were in charge of implementing the agreements made in the Yaoundé and Lomé Conventions and that their duties were therefore initially based purely on development policy. Over the years, their range of tasks and geographical coverage have expanded considerably. Their internal structure has, however, not kept pace with this. Now there is a need for radical reform which, despite all of the changes which the European Parliament has been calling for for years, will not be achieved through this Commission communication either. Development policy is no longer the only area of responsibility of the EU's external service, but it is still of huge significance. The dissolution of political blocs and the changing political processes, including in developing countries, have considerably increased the political as well as the trade and economic dimensions of its work. This is particularly true of the development partnership with the ACP countries, into which the Cotonou Agreement has introduced new aspects. It is precisely in this respect, however, that delegation staff lack qualifications and training; it is precisely here that there is a lack of the necessary schemes for flexible personnel deployment, which should definitely allow for the involvement of local graduates or external experts, if necessary with fixed-term contracts for a particular type of task. In practice, however, delegations in the ACP countries have been and are being threatened with downgrading or even closure. Many posts remain unfilled for long periods of time, without suitable local staff being considered at least temporarily. Even the European Court of Auditors criticises this. The Committee on Development and Cooperation therefore sees a danger that the formation of new regional centres and the move towards regional offices – and good reasons can certainly be put forward in favour of this – could in practice lead to a thinning out of delegation structures in developing countries. That regional offices are more economical than several individual offices is obvious. That they are also more effective has not, however, been verified. Here too the conceptual weakness of the Commission communication manifests itself. From the point of view of content the Commission is still in debt. Mr Galeote's report and the proposals of the committees which have drafted opinions will provide an excellent basis for paying it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe goes online. E-europe, e-learning, e-commerce, e-business are on everyone's lips, and are increasingly setting the political agenda. But what about ‘e-development’? There is no doubt that the targeted use of modern electronic information and communication technologies can open up completely new perspectives for developing countries in particular. Of course, it would be wrong to raise false hopes by presenting ICT as a panacea. However, there is no disputing that in many countries of the Southern hemisphere, there is the potential – and the will – to bridge the digital divide. The developing countries themselves have an urgent interest in doing so, and I can only say that the response to my general report on this issue in the ACP/EU Assembly was extremely positive. The task is to put the developing countries on the net as they move towards the knowledge and information society. This requires a targeted strategy. Our question is this: where is the European Dot-Force – similar to the agreement adopted at the G8 Summit – to promote the developing countries' access to global communications? The European Commission gives its admittedly rather tentative support to one or two projects, but this cannot obscure the fact that there is still no targeted strategy to support the developing countries moving towards the knowledge and information society. The purpose of the report before us is to remedy this situation. I am confident that we will be able to engage in fruitful dialogue with the Commission on these issues. Let me underline the following points. ICT must take on a key role in development cooperation as well. We have therefore proposed to the Commission that an appropriately staffed ‘development unit’ be set up to undertake continuous work in this area. It is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that qualified personnel are available so that we are equipped to deal with all future challenges. Our aim must be to enable the developing countries to share fully in the opportunities afforded by the information society and utilise all available technical options for this purpose. We have already moved closer to this goal: mobile telephony, for example, is ideally suited to cover Africa's vast open spaces. Solar powered telephone transmission cells on village squares, like Internet access, no longer need to be grid-bound and dependent on electricity. New information technologies can also strengthen the links between the people and the state. They can help to improve healthcare, training and education, culture and the environment. They are certainly capable of conveying detailed information on these issues. However, this also requires rules, and I wish to conclude by making that quite clear. Here, too, we must work together with the developing countries to ensure that rules are adopted which enhance the social benefits of the new technologies and are not simply targeted to commercial gain.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘telecom package’, the main parts of which are now being put to the vote in Parliament, is an ambitious venture which, in principle, deserves our support. It makes perfect sense to want to simplify and organise the current legal framework of no less than 28 different legal texts more clearly. That a horizontal approach has been chosen is logical and to be welcomed. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has called unanimously in its opinions on the various reports for care to be taken in all regulations on electronic communications networks and services so as to ensure that no conditions are attached to access which might, in the final analysis, have an adverse effect on the broad range of content. In other words, we must ensure that networks and services of general interest are adequately disseminated. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also sees a need for harmonisation measures within the internal market, but in a wider sense than the Commission, which wants to consolidate its powers here. The institutions have agreed, after years of arduous discussion, that different legal rules are needed for infrastructure and content. They have likewise agreed that there are links between the routes and the content disseminated via them and that these links must be duly acknowledged and taken into account in the interests of cultural variety and democratic opinion-forming within society. The market can do a great deal, but it cannot do everything. In plain text this means, for example, that in order to safeguard pluralism and a variety of opinions, the widespread dissemination of a range of content to a wide public must be guaranteed under a ‘must carry’ obligation, with the Member States alone responsible for putting the flesh on the bones of such a regulation. We must make it clear that Europe has no business interfering in national and regional radio sovereignty. From this point of view, the principle of coordination before harmonisation applies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if Côte d'Ivoire used to be a bastion of stability and democracy compared to other states in western and central Africa, for a long time now it has seen ethnic and religious tensions and, most recently, the abuse of power by the former government under President Bedié, which eventually led to the violent military coup. But the fact that this military regime was recently ousted in the elections, under difficult circumstances, says something about the democratic resolve of the people of Côte d'Ivoire. I believe there is now a chance to restore democracy and the rule of law. Here I wish the current president a good hand and a very delicate touch. The unrest surrounding the elections produced a death toll of about 200, which of course places a heavy burden on the future of the new regime. But we must also say that the day of reconciliation on 9 November will send out new signals in regard to establishing democracy and the rule of law and taking seriously the demand for national reconciliation. The European Union has been asked, and has declared itself prepared, to help ensure that the elections in December, as well as the local elections in January, are conducted in a peaceful, fair, free and transparent manner. Here, too, we must keep a watchful eye and take a constructive approach to this process. Much will depend on whether it really proves possible to consolidate these first cautious steps. Of course that also means amending the constitution so that ethnic origin can no longer be taken as grounds for discrimination. Very many parts of Africa comprise very many different ethnic and religious mixtures. To draw such narrow boundaries between them can only produce problems and difficulties. We know that millions of people living in Côte d'Ivoire come from one of its neighbouring countries. I will not even broach problems such as child labour – for there also there are problems. A peaceful environment needs to be created for these people as well, and they, too, must be given some political responsibility in the country and must not be excluded. In that regard, I believe that the resolution reflects Parliament's resolve to make its contribution and I hope we will also manage to succeed in doing so.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Pack, how much television violence can a child tolerate? The question is not nearly as easy to answer as some people think. And that is one of the findings that has come out of the highly commendable “Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting” that is the subject of the Commission communication. Despite an impressive number of international studies, there is still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and media consumption. Someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image seen on the media, but that does not mean that the cause of that act is also to be found in the media image. That is a most important finding, for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well-being of children and young people and, in particular, we must not mistake the real causes of the sad reality of youth violence. Youth violence is the result of a build-up of several factors, such as experiencing violence in the family, suffering serious social disadvantages, having poor chances for the future because of lack of education, which leads to frustration, which in turn finds its outlet in violence. That fits in with the experience I myself have gleaned during ten years of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile courts. Technical measures to control television offerings cannot resolve these problems. Fortunately, however, the vast majority of children and young people grow up in an environment free of all these types of problem. That is the best youth protection there can possibly be. Here we see parents who are committed to passing on their own moral values and life experiences to their children. As a rule these are rooted in a particular cultural, social and societal background. Systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis. That is also what the Commission is seeking to do, with reference to the findings of the study. Basically, the report we are to vote on here also supports that approach. At the same time, of course, no-one disputes that media images can influence moral values. But we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems, that in no way takes away from broadcaster responsibility. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has therefore called in so many words for the programme and provider responsibility to be established. That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation, although it certainly does not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level. Finally, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also considered it important to urge the Commission to extend all youth protection measures to multimedia offerings of all kinds, since images of violence and other harmful content are certainly no longer confined to conventional television. Europe’s children have been surfing the Internet for a long time now, and they are doing so more and more. It is more important for the children and their parents to learn to use the media properly than to introduce legal restrictions and electronic filters. That is an educational and social task.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the same line as my predecessors, because, unfortunately, we cannot conceal the fact that the public image of European development cooperation bears no relation to the enormous amount of financial support that the EU itself and its Member States gives to the countries of the south. Although the EU is by far the largest donor, it comes off far worse in terms of people’s perceptions than do the large multilateral organisations, such as the UN and the World Bank. Approximately 60% of all financial aid comes out of the European pot. Complementarity, coherence and coordination are the notorious three C’s at the centre of the debate on European development cooperation. The European Commission’s financial housekeeping, which revealed a considerable amount of unspent funds, played no small part in re-igniting the reform debate. Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though. Nor can it be denied that there have been successes that should be shouted from the rooftops. Above all, it is practices that must change, which requires the necessary amount of political will on the part of all those concerned. Take Mozambique and the deployment of ECHO, for example. Right at the very start of the flood disaster at the beginning of February, ECHO rushed to the aid of the most vulnerable with EUR 750 000. Since then, a further EUR 9.65 million have been made available as emergency aid, and EUR 21 million are to be provided in addition, to deal with the consequences in the medium-term. There was a rapid reaction from the Member States too. The European Union and its Member States have provided a total of EUR 85 million in aid, whereas the UN contribution brought the overall international package to only EUR 115 million, including the European funds. What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C’s. Coherence can only be achieved if strategies and measures are brought into line. Complementarity and coordination are important pre-requisites for creating synergy. The juxtaposition of multilateral and bilateral development cooperation, on the other hand – which is in evidence in countries besides Mozambique – leads to completely unnecessary frictional losses, as I saw for myself when I visited the country a few weeks ago. Mrs Ferrer’s report contains a whole host of proposals and demands that deserve our unqualified support. I would like to highlight three points in particular: complementarity, coherence and coordination must be brought together in one uniform strategy because they are interdependent. The political leaders and the civil society of the partner States must have their decision-making powers strengthened, as must the EU delegation posts in situ, which is already happening with the elaboration of national indicative programmes within the scope of ACP cooperation. This will also require there to be improved cooperation between the delegations of the European Union and the diplomatic services of the Member States, which is a matter for the Council. We need to redouble our efforts, in order, not only to further coordination between the EU and the Member States in this sphere, but also with the international bodies. Since we provide the lion’s share of the funding for development cooperation, we are also entitled to clear recognition on the operational front and in terms of public perceptions. There have certainly been positive moves in this direction, but they must be developed, and consolidated in a definitive frame of reference. At the same time, we must overcome the burdensome legacy of colonial history, or the geo-strategic interests of individual Member States. The lack of political will on the part of the Member States represents the greatest obstacle to us being able to practise the three C’s satisfactorily, because they have no real interest in efficient, harmonised development cooperation, thereby tarnishing the European image and preventing us from optimising our potential as regards development policy, which reflects badly on the Member States themselves more than anything. Those in the European capitals ought to learn that strengthening Europe’s standing can do the same for their own image.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a glance at German cable television, where some 30 channels are now already jostling for attention, is enough to show that multiplicity is not the same thing as diversity. In competition with commercial suppliers, there is easily a danger of succumbing to demands for mass appeal and neglecting less lucrative areas of interest. That is why it is so important for audiovisual strategy to be linked to protection of the pluralism and diversity of opinion which are now the crucial bases for democratic opinion-forming, as well as for public service media to be guaranteed an equal opportunity to develop in the media market of the future. There must be non-discriminatory access to this future market for all citizens, and there must also be non-discriminatory access for suppliers of all types of content. Specifically, this means market transparency and preventing developments whereby economic power turns into the concentration of media ownership and finally into the abuse of political power. These key considerations define the most important premisses for the further development of statutory frameworks. Mr Veltroni's report makes important proposals in this area. However, not everything can be regulated by law. I should therefore like to address a matter which has still not been mentioned in this House, namely the acquisition of media-related skills. You have to get to know your way around what the multimedia world has to offer in order to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, select what is of value and hone your judgement. The transfer of media-related skills must become a component of the Community’s audiovisual strategy. To that extent, the Commission’s communication still does not go far enough.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I associate myself entirely with the words of praise that have been showered on this report and shall come to the point without further ado. We are now entering the third round of support programmes for European films, and this support remains absolutely vital, for the European audiovisual industry has undoubtedly been in crisis for quite a long time. The following evidence may be added to what we have already heard. About one in three of the films made in the EU is never shown in a cinema, and a large percentage of those that do make it into the cinema are watched by a total audience of fewer than 130 000. A film will not normally start to yield a return on the initial investment until a million cinemagoers have paid to watch it. Only one-fifth of European films ever leave their home country; of those that do, nine-tenths go no further than neighbouring European countries. One of the strengths of the European film industry also accounts for its structural weakness. Low-budget productions in the tradition of the film d'auteur 
often cannot be made without the aid of national support funds and frequently appeal to a limited audience of young intellectuals. During production and afterwards, an adequate promotion and marketing budget is generally lacking. Cultural and linguistic diversity are matchless assets but sadly often stand in the way of widespread distribution. Great though the dream of conquering the U.S. film market may be, let us keep our feet on the European ground! We must not neglect to strengthen our national markets, and we need to do more to develop the European market more effectively. If some laurels can be reaped along the way, so much the better! Competitiveness and marketability are commendable aims of MEDIA Plus. The programme draws on the lessons learned from the experience of the preceding programmes, but although the Council and the Commission are well aware of the present situation, they are still afraid to take the plunge. Big cinema needs big money. One of the lessons that has been learned is that capping production costs as a condition of support is an obstacle to the creation of good films. The funding of support programmes is not the only issue here. There is also the question of allowing the provision of venture capital. Here we are confronted with a sorry state of affairs. European companies and banks do invest considerable sums of money in the programme industry, but they tend to invest in America rather than Europe. That is why, back in 1995, the Green Paper on strategy options to strengthen the European programme industry in the context of the audiovisual policy of the European Union proposed the establishment of a European guarantee fund, which the Council stubbornly rejected – the German Government, sad to say, being the foremost opponent of the scheme – without offering an alternative solution. This report therefore marks a new attempt to put this financial instrument on the agenda as an accompanying measure. In Germany there is a new Government, which will not necessarily feel that it would lose face by reversing the rejectionist stance of its predecessor, so perhaps we can now hope for a more conciliatory response. Last but not least, we must not forget the television companies, which act as the driving force of the programme industry by investing large sums of money in audiovisual productions and by providing opportunities for the transmission of audiovisual works. A key role attaches to the public corporations in particular. They possess a wealth of human and material resources, which are often the prerequisite for successful productions.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the lack of speaking time available to me I would not wish to repeat anything that has already been said. I can only lend wholehearted support to what the previous speakers and Mrs Maij-Weggen have had to say. However I would like to add to the debt of gratitude we owe Mr Schori a word of thanks to the embassies of our Member States, who assisted us in the accreditation process, because we were faced with a rather chaotic situation at the time. We have them to thank for the fact that we were able to take action over there.   If there is one thing that should be emphasised when forming an assessment of the situation in Zimbabwe it is that the farm occupations have nothing to do with the land or race issues. It is no more than a despicable means of holding onto power. That is not without its tragic side because President Mugabe and his party definitely rendered outstanding service to the land once. The terror perpetrated by the so-called war veterans is intended to divert attention from the shortcomings of the political leadership of the country, which has pitched Zimbabwe into a deep crisis. The country has been brought to the brink of ruin, tourism is at a standstill, investors have pulled out, and to make matters worse, there is an oil crisis and a lack of foreign exchange. Tobacco production and tourism used to be the main sources of revenue and both these sectors have taken a real knock. This cannot be made good overnight. This is where support from the European Union comes in.   All in all, Zimbabwe has the right conditions in place for this, in that the population is educated to a comparatively high standard, the jurisdiction is incorruptible, and the infrastructure is relatively sound. But we are already hearing about fresh occupations of farms and violent attacks. President Mugabe must be left in no doubt as to the fact that the violence and terror must be stopped, but it will take more than that to restore peace to this country. The political opposition will have to prove that it is politically viable. The fact that it was possible for observers to be present meant that in the end, despite the terror, the opposition was able to express its opinion freely on voting day. That being the case, the opposition now has a job to do which it must see through. We must help to see that the rule of law is restored in this way.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all too often, Africa is seen by Europe as a lost continent, which is why this EU-Africa summit was long overdue. This event must not be used as an alibi; it must mark the beginning of a real partnership. If we are honest, then we must examine our own motives because, the truth is that a sort of Africa summit would also suit the European Parliament, because dealing with this subject usually means extremely topical and highly dramatic incidents, with conceptional discussions and efforts to find the right perspective generally getting the thin edge of the wedge, if you disregard the fact that Africa is a predominant subject at the ACP assembly. But who notices that here in Europe? Africa is the continent most seriously affected by the injustices of the international economic and financial system and the consequences of globalisation. The promise by the German government and by other European countries to write off the debts of the poorest countries in the world will help considerably, because the high level of debt is an obstacle to investments in all forms of infrastructure in the countries in question and is hence one of the biggest obstacles in the fight against poverty. Governments which have not yet decided to join this move should copy those who have already done so. Success will only be achieved in the long term by finding points which unite rather than separate us and by endeavouring to reach a mutual understanding and to integrate Africa into the international community of nations. Nonetheless, it is clear that something may, indeed must be demanded of the governments of Africa when it comes to safeguarding human rights, basic democratic order and the rule of law. There can be no question of allowing dictatorial rule on the African continent which, as in Zimbabwe now, fosters racism, dispossession and forcible suppression and ousts an operational legal system. The Lomé Convention offers a suitable framework for consultation, political dialogue and, if necessary, the suspension of cooperation. Still less can there be any question of allowing financial aid and food aid from the European Union to be misused in order to buy weapons. Newsreels showing wretched people starving are currently flickering across our television screens from Ethiopia, while the government is siphoning millions into new arms and has even turned down Eritrea’s offer to allow its ports and transport routes to be used for aid for Ethiopia, despite the continuing state of war. That is immoral and an important chance to make a move towards reconciliation may have been wasted. Banning the NGO meeting from Cairo was a most unpleasant side effect. The countries of Africa will have to get used to the fact that non-governmental organisations have an important status as part of the civil society and can act as mediators in the development of an autonomous civil society in these vulnerable countries on the path towards stability and peace.

 Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects. Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world. Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides. So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999. The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly. Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s. They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries. The after-shocks can still be felt. ACP cooperation is a dynamic process. The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI. At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71. All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa. Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself. So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention. Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states. That also means strengthening the democratic institutions. The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction. In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament. We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at. Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed. One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration. There is one wish on the European Parliament’s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies. Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect. For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation. The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction. But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget. I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.

 Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council. It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture’s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests. In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order. The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead. The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished. A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap. This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union’s cultural policy activities once again. The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support. Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered. The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro! And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004. That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house’s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years! There is a blatant discrepancy here! And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content. Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out. We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day. Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm! Cultural cooperation – and this was also mentioned earlier – truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be. Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions. What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?

Mr President, please believe that I know what I am talking about because my father owned a book shop. My parents had a small book shop in a small town. There was not much to do there, but anyway. I can assure you that, without book price fixing, we could not have survived, which is why, Commissioner, your statements can only be felt as a disappointment and your presentation has made it clear that the question of cross-border book price fixing threatens to turn into an endless saga. It is a truism to say that books are not goods like butter, eggs and cheese and that they are a cultural asset which cannot be dealt with under competition law like butter, eggs and cheese. That does not alter the fact that there is printed matter which does not meet this claim. However, the exception should not be seen here as the rule, nor should we take as a yardstick the fact that there are books which earn a great deal of money. Best-sellers are, indeed, the exception to the rule. It is not right to see books merely as an economic asset. Luckily, your predecessor, who represented this view, was clearly unable to make it stick. So we still have reason to hope, but the danger has clearly not been averted, far from it. Hence our urgent request, to which we expect a clear answer, Commissioner, that books should be seen as cultural products. Obviously, national book price fixing systems are, thankfully, not disputed; consequently, the possibility must be granted for regulations such as those which now exist, for single cross-border language areas. What has been preserved over a hundred years in the German-speaking area between Austria, Germany and Switzerland, what has permitted a large diversity of titles and has ensured that competition is not excluded and that there is a comprehensive supply of large and small bookshops in both town and country, should not be sacrificed to the unbridled and extortionate pressure of the market leaders, not in book shops, not in the mail order business and not in e-commerce. As a cultural asset, books have the right to equal status in the various channels, including sales channels, to the reader. The French regulation which, in addition to the national price fixing system, also includes regulations on imports, exports and re-imports, offers a way forward which is compatible with the EU and which has proven its worth in practice, which is why, Commissioner, the European Parliament is waiting, across the group divide as you will no doubt have seen, for the go-ahead for a similar legal or contractual regulation for Germany and Austria, in order to bring this endless saga to a happy ending at last. Or do you prefer to expose yourself to the reproach that the Commission is a committee of philistines? You should spare yourself this sad reputation. You have to decide between culture and commerce. Please opt for culture. (Applause)

 Mr President, whoever would like to know what use the Audiovisual Observatory is, needs only to cast a glance at the contents page of any issue of the legal journal, IRIS, for example the issue for September 1999. Here, there is a report about a resolution to enact a Directive from the European Commission requiring Member States to ensure that no telecommunications company of relevance to the market should be able to operate its cable television network through the same legal entity. Another report is about the plan for a comprehensive French draft law concerning the information society which is to govern, among other things, questions about the free use of codings, about confidentiality in data transfers, about copyright protection and about necessary regulatory authorities. A third report concerns the latest judgements of the European Court of Human Rights through which 13 complaints against Turkey were heard and in eleven of which the Court agreed with the appellants and recognised violations of the law concerning free expression. All this amounts to far more than just collating statistical material, and I think it makes it clear why this institution is important.  This impressively casts some light upon the objectives with which the founding of the Observatory was originally justified, namely those of surveying the market and promoting transparency there, as well as collecting and processing information and statistics concerning the audiovisual sector. Industry and related areas, and also the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament, have since reaped the benefits of the Observatory’s services in many different ways. It has not, however, had any binding legal basis, and this is now to be created on the basis of Article 130a, paragraph 3 of the EC Treaty and with reference to the fact that, as a provider of information, it is mainly to contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry by improving the flow of information. The transparency which is to be produced in this way is an indispensable prerequisite for political action on Europe’s road to the information society, even if this is not perhaps to the liking of those who want to throw open the doors to unbridled market forces. I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has come out in favour of a five-year period of applicability. This view is shared by my Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact the problem cannot be taken seriously enough. AIDS is threatening to become a health catastrophe on an unimaginable scale, particularly in the countries of Africa south of the Sahara. Children are affected above all. According to an estimate by UNAIDS and the World Health Organisation, 7 out of every 10 people newly infected with the HIV virus live in this region. In the case of children under 15 years of age, the figure is as many as 9 out of 10. Approximately 83% of deaths from AIDS take place here, and at least 95% of all children orphaned by AIDS are African boys and girls in this region. Of the 34 million people infected since the epidemic appeared in this part of Africa, 11.5 million have already died, a quarter of them children.  At the same time, reference has been made to the fact that all the successes there have been in terms of increasing life expectancy have been reduced to nothing. In many countries, life expectancy has even fallen again to the level recorded in the 1960s. To put it another way: a child who is born today in an African country badly affected by AIDS has an average life expectancy of only 43 years. Without AIDS, it could have been 60 years.  The situation in Eastern and Southern Africa is particularly dramatic. In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, a fifth of the adult population is infected or ill with AIDS. This dreadful situation could continue indefinitely. However, AIDS is no inevitable fate. A number of countries such as Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda committed themselves early on to prevention, and with success. It is high time that, where the politics of health are concerned, the emergency brake was put on throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and also in other affected parts of the world. Social, political and religious taboos have no place here. They must be cleared away; how and by whom is immaterial.  Trivialising AIDS and making it taboo are a direct route to catastrophe. The partnership, AIDS against AIDS in Africa, founded at the Lusaka Conference, deserves firm support from the European Union, both in material terms and in terms of visionary perspective. Civilian society, including the private sector, together with representatives of governments, international aid organisations and non-governmental organisations of various kinds have come together in order to declare war on the epidemic. They have undertaken to launch comprehensive AIDS or, rather, anti-AIDS programmes in all African States. One of the ambitious goals of these programmes is to achieve a 25% reduction in the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 newly infected by AIDS, and this by the year 2005 in the most badly affected countries and by the year 2010 in all countries. These efforts can and must be supplemented by the European Union and, above all, vigorously supported through cooperation with the ACP countries.  In fact, the European Union has not been inactive to date. Between 1987 and 1997, almost 200 million ecus or euros were spent on HIV/AIDS programmes in more than 90 developing countries. This fact should be expressly recognised. To this will be added, over the next three years, a further EUR 45 million in the context of a special budget strand for developing countries in regions around the world, together with EUR 20 million for a regional 5-year programme for the ACP countries and additional funds in the context of specific programmes such as those for the ACP countries. These figures do not include, for example, research programmes or co-financing by non-governmental organisations. More than in Europe, it is young girls who are especially at risk in Africa. Nowhere are there more teenage mothers and nowhere do they give birth to a larger number of infected babies.  The main effort must therefore be to educate young people. This is a task which must be carried out in schools. The education campaigns and condom advertising in Tanzania and Uganda have shown that success is possible. Above all, the radio must be employed as a means of information to reach everybody. Here too, specific measures of support are absolutely necessary. Joint efforts in a spirit of partnership are the right path to go down. But if these are to be effective, more rather than less resources are needed and, in this regard, I am anxious about the Commission’s, as well as this Chamber’s, financial policy. Mrs Maij-Weggen, I hope that your group will help ensure that the decisions of the Committee on Budgets that I have heard about will be revoked or altered in the plenary sitting, while any watering down of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Development will be reversed. We must together ensure that whatever it is that we want can also be financed.

 Mr President, I too wish to join with the previous speakers in expressing my deepest sympathy with the people of Spain, the victims, and their families. Difficult though it is to pass on to the agenda, our topic is ‘health care and care for the elderly’, and it is a very important one. In all probability, this report will receive very broad support in the House today – the result of excellent cooperation between Members belonging to all the political groupings, for which I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all of them, but especially to Mr Mantovani. I might add that my report follows on from his own, which he presented a year ago, and the things we called for then are every bit as relevant today as they were at the time; indeed, the problems have become even more pressing. Let me only cite the length of time people have to wait for treatment, the worsening staffing bottlenecks and the alarming reports of conditions in care homes, some of which are degrading. Governments, too, have now realised how important it actually is to organise a structured exchange of information both in the health sector and in the sphere of care for the elderly. Whilst the results of the high-level reflection process speak for themselves, we now have no more time to lose, and so we strongly urge the European Council to adopt at last the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable. The common objectives and indicators should be agreed by early 2006. After all, the Convention did, in its draft treaty, specify open coordination for health policy – with, of course, this House participating as it should. If the Member States want to guarantee the future accessibility, quality and financial viability of health systems and care for the elderly, then what is needed most of all is more prevention and transparency. At both European and national levels, prevention and health promotion must receive the same attention as curative medicine. If they do not, we really will soon be unable to cope with the growing burden of patients. Transparency, though, is an indispensable requirement if quality is to be maintained and if the best possible use is to be made of the resources that health systems possess. Far more than has formerly been the case, the quality of medical services must be demonstrable. We must no longer spend a lot of money and get poor quality in return. Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and must, in future, be more involved in all decisions on matters of health policy. All Member States should also adopt a patients’ law or patients’ charter, but, in order to secure greater legal security for people who become ill and have to be treated abroad, we also need common European standards for patients’ rights. It would indeed be a major breakthrough if a European patients’ charter were to be adopted, and so we urge the Commission and the Member States to devise shared criteria for one. A large number of questions, though, still remain open after the European Court of Justice’s rulings on the reimbursement of treatment costs incurred in another Member State, and so what we expect from the Commission is proposals, not only as to how patients can have greater legal certainty, but also as to how the national health services can be protected from the potentially adverse effects of the internal market rules. The effects of European rules should be monitored by a standing committee of experts, which would submit reports on a regular basis. The fact is that health is not an economic commodity; our health services are founded on solidarity, and that must be defended. All the Member States also face major challenges as regards long-term care and care for the elderly. We should join together in seeking strategies for integrating health provision and care more effectively with each other, for better care at home and for the provision of sufficient care homes. There is also a need for clear standards of care, not only in people’s own homes but also in institutions, and, above all, for regular and independent quality controls. There is, then, much to be done if our European model of a health policy founded upon solidarity is to be maintained in the long term.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, something like one in four Europeans die of cancer, but thousands of people could be saved every year if high-quality early detection programmes were in place in every Member State. We all know that. That is why I very much welcome the Commission’s initiative in recommending to the Member States that they introduce screening, the need for which is confirmed by scientific evidence. I see it as absolutely scandalous that, for example, only eight Member States have to date started to offer national programmes for mammography screening to all, even though, according to WHO, this cuts the mortality rate by up to 36%, and even though the quality guidelines for this were presented as long ago as 1992. Commissioner, I regret that I cannot avoid issuing what is both an appeal and a warning. If we are to really take this Council recommendation seriously, you cannot at the same time allow all the screening networks to be forced to close down their operations. At the end of the day, it was the work of the European Cancer Networks that led to this Council recommendation. If you, the Commission, want to have real credibility in the fight against cancer, then you have to find a permanent place for screening in the new action programme on health. We must not allow a recurrence of what happened this year, when the word ‘cancer’ no longer appeared in the action programme’s work plan, which – as you know all too well – eventually, and inevitably, resulted in support for all the screening networks being discontinued. Commissioner, we will still, in future, need the European networks to draw up new guidelines and improve existing ones, for only by these means will we achieve equally high standards of screening across the EU. In addition, though, we need the networks to support the new Member States, where, as is well known, action is even more urgently needed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I am pleased that today’s agenda also includes the discharge of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work. This meets our central demand from last year, namely that there should be an individual discharge procedure for all decentralised agencies, thereby at last having equal treatment for the agencies. My committee is of course in favour of discharge for the agency in Bilbao, just as is the Committee on Budgetary Control. We therefore also agree with the verdict of the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the Council. Let me say a few words about this Agency, which was created in 1997. Bilbao has now become the driving force in the field of safety and health at work. I need only mention its outstanding work in implementing the special programme for SMEs in 2001 and 2002. The splendid work it has done was also confirmed by an external evaluation. It was therefore only logical that in our resolution on the Community strategy for health and safety at work for the period 2002-2006 in October last year we called on the Commission to prepare a multiannual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises in the future. It is of course clear that there must in future too be the best possible coordination between the agencies in Bilbao and Dublin. Even though there are no grounds for criticism from our point of view, we welcome the fact that the two agencies have concluded a specific cooperation agreement in order to improve complementarity and banish all danger of overlapping in their work. But we shall remain very vigilant here, especially in the light of enlargement and a possible redefinition of agency policy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to tell you that 15 national presidents from the European Breast Cancer Coalition, Europa Donna, are following this debate in the public gallery. Breast cancer affects all of us. In the European Union, someone is diagnosed with it every two and a half minutes. Every year, 216 000 women suffer from this disease and 79 000 women still die from it even though 90% of all cases can be cured if they are diagnosed and properly treated at an early stage. For the most part, these women die when they have their most important responsibilities in society. Breast cancer is still the most frequent cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 55. Every year, though, 25 000 women could be saved if all Member States were to offer proper preventive care, that is to say, screening in accordance with the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening. They would provide women with a guarantee that their radiologist carries out only breast X-ray examinations and that he reads about 5 000 mammograph screenings a year, which enables him to evaluate them with an experienced eye. It is completely unacceptable that, eleven years after the EU guidelines were submitted, only eight Member States offer national mammography screening programmes. In countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, 90% of all women aged between 50 and 69 already participate in screening programmes, but in my own country of Germany, barely 2% of women in this age group are offered screening. This despite the fact that, according to the World Health Organisation, it can be proved that mammography screening reduces mortality by an unbelievable 35%. Even the best early detection is of no use however if subsequent treatment is inadequate, or downright wrong. The report therefore calls on Member States to establish a network of multidisciplinary breast centres to cover the entire population of the EU, with one centre for every 330 000 inhabitants. These centres should be certified by an independent body and subject to regular review. The entire medical team of doctors and nurses should specialise in both benign and malignant breast disease and there should be multidisciplinary case conferences to discuss each case. It is particularly important that the surgeons should perform only breast operations, and that the centre should perform a minimum of 150 primary breast cancer operations per year, because expert knowledge comes only through experience. These breast centres are extremely important because it has been shown that women who are treated in them have a higher chance of being cured. Rates of survival in Sweden, for example, which has both nation-wide screening and breast centres, are 16% higher than in Austria, where neither of these exist. In fact, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have breast centres that cover the entire country. It is precisely because of these disparities in the mortality and survival rates that we must develop a common European strategy in the fight against breast cancer. We have to get the right information quicker and get better at exchanging experience. We have to introduce a system of benchmarking and be guided by best practice. This is the only way to save the lives of more women and, at the same time, help to reduce the cost of health care. And I am convinced that it is the only way to exert positive pressure on countries that lag behind. The same is also true of national cancer registers, which are a fundamental prerequisite for reliable data, and which exist only in half of the Member States. Our request to governments to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU is not unrealistic. It can be achieved if the political will exists and if the medical profession supports us. The United Kingdom has been exemplary in showing us how. In this regard, I would ask the Commission to join us in taking stock of the situation in 2006. We know that the Commission is on our side. This was made clear once more with the proposal for a Council recommendation on cancer prevention. It is only if the proposals made in this report are rapidly implemented that every woman in Europe – irrespective of place of residence, social status and education – will soon have the same optimum screening for, and treatment of, cancer.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would simply like to begin with a few general remarks about the Structural Funds. 2001 was anything but a good year for the Structural Funds. It shows, with no ifs and buts, that the main objectives of the 1999 Structural Funds reform were not achieved. Firstly, as with the previous reform, this time, too, there were quite considerable delays in moving from the old to the new programming period. Secondly, the authorisation and administration procedures have not been simplified as originally planned. Thirdly, the approach of decentralising day-to-day administration of funds while at the same time strengthening controls has failed. The situation is indeed alarming. The Member States are far from having used all the money available to them. That is true both for the period from 1994 to 1999 and for the new Structural Fund period. In 2001, for example, only half the money originally envisaged by the Member States was called. We all know what that means. That is why the next Structural Fund reform, which will then cover not 15 but 25 states, will have to return to the principles that we actually wanted to implement with the last reform. These are first of all concentration on a few clear priorities, secondly simplification of resource administration, and thirdly a more performance-related approach to the distribution of funds, something I have called for repeatedly but in vain. The fourth demand would then have to be to avoid abrupt changeovers between programming periods in future. I come now to the European Social Fund itself. Let me please make it absolutely clear that we on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are very concerned about the sometimes very serious cases of mismanagement in the use of money from the Social Fund by the Member States and that we fully support the Commission here, Commissioner, in all its investigations and controls. Sometimes we really do get the feeling that some Member States really do not want to make the effort to improve things. As rapporteur for the last Social Fund reform, I was really very deeply concerned to read what the Court of Auditors has now written in its special report on the use of ‘social risk capital’, an instrument that this House pushed through especially in order to oblige the Member States to make a suitable amount of funding available as ‘grants’ to non-governmental organisations and local partnerships. The Court of Auditors notes that the Member States have made hardly any use of the instrument. In two cases, Germany and Austria, it was not used at all. I really cannot understand this. On the other hand, I have to ask the Commission why it did not inform us of this intolerable state of affairs earlier. The fact is that some Member States are clearly in breach of the Social Fund Regulation. I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to find, without delay, a solution acceptable to all sides. This afternoon the Commission will be presenting us its proposal for the employment guidelines. We will then for the first time have employment guidelines for three years. That will at last give us an opportunity to make the European Social Fund – the only labour market policy instrument we have at European level – a genuine part of employment strategy because then we will no longer have different periods of validity. We now have for the first time the opportunity to coherently dovetail employment strategy and Social Fund measures in order to reduce unemployment and … (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent and, above all, important report. Time and again, women complain about the damage suffered to their health following the use of breast implants or about operations that have had undesirable cosmetic results. Incidentally, 80% of breast implant operations are carried out for purely cosmetic reasons. The constant physical and emotional suffering caused by the implant operations is often immense. As a rule this ought to be avoidable, as the cause is not the implants per se
. This has been confirmed in studies, and particularly impressively by the STOA study from the year 2000. The causes are more usually the implants not being fitted by specialists, the device not being replaced automatically after a few years and the continuing lack of regular medical aftercare, not to mention the fact that women are still not fully informed about the potential risks, which vary from case to case, before the operation. That is why there is an urgent need to impress on the Member States that they must finally ensure that women are fully informed before an operation of this kind and, above all, that they must stop a plethora of insufficiently qualified beauty surgeons from working by introducing additional qualification requirements and subjecting their clinics to more stringent inspections. If we want to optimise quality assurance then this is the second step, now that we have already taken the first step, together with the Commission, of putting in place stricter product safety standards. I am thinking of the recent decision to reclassify breast implants as class 3 medical devices. My group is also calling for an implant passport to be introduced, which would give information both about the characteristics of the implant and about the necessary post-operative care and would identify the surgeon. The passport should be signed by the doctor and the patient before the operation as a clear declaration of consent. In the light of the many complications that can arise after breast implant operations – which were brought to our attention not least by the petitions sent in by thousands of women in 1998 – I think it is quite frankly scandalous and completely incomprehensible that so far only one Member State has introduced a national implant register. It will come as no surprise either then to learn that at the moment we do not have either precise figures on the implant operations carried out or complete scientific findings based on the adverse effects suffered by the women. That is why it is of the utmost urgency to start setting up a national register for breast implants in all of the Member States immediately, and to join the international breast implant register. In my view, this whole sorry tale also illustrates yet again why we urgently need multidisciplinary breast centres, in which benign and malignant diseases can be treated and beauty operations carried out under one roof, and where quality is guaranteed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my very warm thanks to Mr Mantovani for his excellent cooperation. I think we have succeeded in securing a broad majority in tomorrow's plenary for this most important report. It is also timely that we should at last achieve closer cooperation in health policy and, of course, also in care for the elderly, something to which the Gothenburg Summit, albeit very late in the day, pointed the way. Let us just be honest. In matters of health policy, the EU is still catching up with reality. In many fields, after all, a European health policy already exists – the Euregios spring to mind. Even now, to take an example, patients in the German Rhineland have the right to use their German health insurance cards to obtain treatment in health centres in the Netherlands. Apart from that, Europe has hospitals generally recognised as specialising in specific diseases, and there are also European networks that draw up guidelines for the treatment of those diseases. All the Member States are looking for strategies to guarantee that their health care systems will, in future, remain accessible to all and to secure their standards of quality and performance, as well as ensuring that it is possible to finance them. New mechanisms are constantly being tried out, but, as yet, nobody has made the great breakthrough. So, when governments realise the importance of organising an EU-wide exchange of experience on matters concerning health care and the care of the elderly, they are simply being logically consistent. Just to take the wind out of the sceptics' sails, let me say that I am convinced that nobody in this House actively wants a single European system of health care. The Commission does not, and the Council very definitely does not. The organisation and funding of health care systems is a matter decided at the national level and should remain so in future. It is far more a case of how we are to retain, in the long term, our European model of a health care policy based on solidarity. I am speaking quite deliberately in terms of a European model, as the following four principles underlie all health care systems. The first is that health is not, and must not be allowed to become, a purely economic commodity. The second is that equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain one. The third is that, as has already been said, all systems of health care are based upon the principle of solidarity. And the fourth is that the State has a crucial role to play in regulating, funding and providing services. Now, the Mantovani report makes quite practical proposals as to what enhanced European cooperation in health care policy might be like. These proposals have to do with methodology, objectives and specific content. As regards the working method, the report proposes that the open method of coordination should now be brought into play in this area as it has been elsewhere, which is consonant – I am very glad to say – with what the Greek Presidency has said. Now, though, we must not lose any more time, and it is for that reason that the report urges the forthcoming European spring summit to resolve upon a precise timetable for further action and to agree on common targets and indicators within one year. If, though, we are to be able to carry out any kind of exchange of experience, we have to start by improving the national and European systems of health monitoring. Comparable data are absolutely indispensable here, but to date the EU has not even had a standard measurement of mortality rates. This is where we can even now make progress by using the new action programme on health care policy. The same is true of the establishment of common criteria for patients' rights, and, in view of eastward enlargement in particular, there is a need for a survey of patient mobility in the Euregios, for we know all too well that the shortfall in health care provision is especially pronounced in the regions bordering on the new Member States, and any European constitution must not only stipulate a high standard of health care as an objective, but also health policy's continuing status as a responsibility shared between the EU and the Member States. We do all, after all, want the EU to be able to keep on, in future, using legislation to supplement the Member States' policies.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to focus my attention on the agencies. It is there that we urgently need more efficient and transparent monitoring and controls. I say that not only because the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has responsibility for four of the agencies, but also in view of the fact that the number of agencies is constantly increasing. Today there are eleven agencies, but there will soon be 14 of them, for, as you will be aware, we will also have agencies for the safety of food, and for safety in travel by air and sea, once the issue is resolved of where they are to be based. As already mentioned, our committee is responsible for four agencies, in Dublin, Bilbao, Thessaloniki and Turin, and we have, in principle, no problems with them, but this does not alter the fact that there is a fundamental problem with Parliament having only one discharge procedure for four agencies. Yes, the agencies do now have their own rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets, and Mr Kuckelkorn has already achieved a great deal. Nonetheless, though, we do need all the agencies to be treated on an equal basis, and so, today, I call on the Commission to draw up proposals to put all the agencies on an equal footing in the discharge procedure. To do this we must, above all, make appropriate changes to their legal basis, without which the future will find us still incapable of auditing the agencies satisfactorily when the Budget comes round, and that cannot be in anybody's interest. Cooperation between the committees of this House also needs to be improved. The guidelines for the agencies drawn up in 1998 should therefore be examined from four angles: with a view to ensuring appropriate control machinery in the specialised committees and transparency in the Budget procedure, reinforcing the requirement for mutual information and clear demarcation of competences between the committees involved. Our committee will be drawing up proposals in relation to this. Let me, in conclusion, again warmly thank Mr McCartin and Mr Staes for their support so far in this regard. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis very warmly for his excellent report. But thanks are also due to the committee responsible, which accepted all 16 amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights. This shows that once again, this House is much further ahead than some Member States with their national health policies. Although we women constitute the majority of the population, and although the double and triple burden of work, family and caring for relatives are shown to take a greater toll on our health, women-specific aspects do not always receive the attention they deserve in health policy. Our health systems are usually gender-blind. National reports rarely include a breakdown by gender. Yet it is telling that in Europe and beyond, the majority of people who are dependent on medication are women. In Germany, the figure is 70%. So we urgently need more solid data, and above all, a holistic approach to health throughout Europe. Gender policies must also be granted a central role in health policy in future: in research, prevention and treatment. The new Public Health Action Programme can pave the way in this regard. Every 20 minutes, a woman dies of breast cancer in Europe. It affects one woman in nine. The probability of contracting this disease increases from year to year. Yet if it is detected in time and properly treated, breast cancer is curable. So here too, best practice is imperative. We must ensure that it is not only in early detection that breakthroughs are widely promoted throughout the EU. After the adoption of the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening, the task now is to research and promote best practice for treatment as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it makes no sense at all to me. They decide, in Lisbon, to do their level best to return to full employment as soon as possible, they lament the fact that there is social exclusion, and they profess to want to tackle all forms of discrimination, yet when it comes to drafting the budget, it all gets swept aside by the Commission and the Council. Our citizens, not to mention this House, have had enough of this policy of merely paying lip service. We in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs favour a thrifty budget too, but not in this way. I am therefore pleased, and would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Budgets, and above all, the general rapporteur, for the fact that we have at last worked out a joint plan on how to rectify the difficulties attending this draft budget, with a view to accommodating Parliament’s clear priorities, and boosting employment and social cohesion, although, naturally the situation still leaves something to be desired from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. It fills me with confidence that together, we have managed to save our employment initiative for local engagement, which was launched last year, because this is the initiative that supports new employment policy measures at local level, whilst involving all players, NGOs included. The Commission’s attempt to abolish this initiative showed out-and-out disregard for the political will of Lisbon and the priorities of this House. I also welcome the fact that, in future, we will aim to do more for health and safety protection in the workplace again. The new initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises will illustrate best practice in this sphere, and lend added value accordingly. Naturally we would have liked to see the action programmes for combating social exclusion and discrimination better provided for, so as not to disappoint the expectations that Article 13 has given rise to amongst the public, and also the NGOs. But then every committee has simply had to accept compromises on that score. However, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs feels there is a more serious problem still to be addressed, namely that the budget makes no provision whatsoever for the observatory for industrial change. Therefore I say again to all those who denigrate this project: firstly, no one wants a new, expensive agency. Instead, the agency in Dublin should only be entrusted with the relevant tasks. Secondly, the observation point’s task would be to collect information, so as to assist the process of industrial change. No more and no less. Anyone who maintains that part of its job would be to block mergers or halt globalisation, does so for purely polemical reasons. And so I hope that when it comes to tomorrow’s vote, we will still achieve the majority required for the observation point in Dublin

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a clear need for action on the issue of undeclared work in all the Member States, for there have not so far been many successes in combating it. All the more reason, then, for me to welcome the Commission’s communication on undeclared work because it gets the discussion going at European level. In this way, I now come to a core demand of this really excellent report by Mrs Glase. We must unreservedly include the fight against undeclared work in European employment strategy. With problems of this complexity, we need to exchange views, learn from each other and, in accordance with the tried and tested motto for our employment strategy, always seek best practice. We must take a close look at the issue of undeclared work in order to be able to combat its various causes efficiently. I would warn against over-simplification, three forms of which I would also at this point immediately oppose on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. The first point concerns the repeatedly made assertion according to which undeclared work is in the first place traceable to unduly high taxes and social security contributions. I would say to my fellow MEPs in the conservative camp that things are really not that simple. Let us take Austria and Italy, for example. In Austria, taxes are significantly higher than in Italy. In spite of that, there is very much more undeclared work in Italy. High taxes and social charges are therefore only one reason among many. Or look at Scandinavia. There, taxes and social charges are somewhat higher still. On the other hand, the amount of undeclared work is comparatively small. This no doubt also means that the quantity of undeclared work also has something to do with social acceptability, that is to say with a society’s social coherence. Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo. Secondly, I should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work. This would-be panacea does not in fact work. The Thatcher era in Britain taught us that. The amount of undeclared work rose then, despite the fact that the labour market was made more flexible and social charges were reduced. Making the labour market more flexible is something which no doubt only works if correspondingly high social standards can be maintained. Thirdly, undeclared work is not primarily the result of illegal immigration from third countries. On the contrary, the majority of those who engage in undeclared work are our own citizens. As Mrs Glase’s report shows, we need a sensible policy mix at national and European levels. As a part of this, public authorities throughout the EU must also be jointly liable for ensuring that no contracts at all are awarded to companies whose quotations can quite clearly be traced back to the existence of undeclared work. In the same way, companies need to be jointly and severally liable towards their sub-contractors. However, we also want a right of class action which could help the trade unions, in particular, to take proceedings against those suspected of not declaring their employees or only partially declaring them.

Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, allow me to come straight to the points that are causing my committee the most concern. It is almost as if the Commission has forgotten that we committed ourselves to establishing full employment again in the European Union, when we were in Lisbon, which is something President Chirac emphasised again before this House only this morning.   How else are we to explain the fact that of all the budget headings, it is the one for local commitment for employment that the Commission wants to completely do away with? I am appalled by the idea, and have every right to be, given that only in April, the Commission issued a statement highlighting the importance of the local dimension to Europe’s employment strategy. This budget heading was one of Parliament’s initiatives. We wanted more money for employment and we wanted to gather more experience of similar projects over three years so as to be able to subsequently arrive at a legal basis. Hence there are, of course, no possible circumstances under which we would endorse the Commission’s decision on this, simply because, as a Commission, you have run out of ideas at the moment for promoting innovative measures in the Social Fund. We very much hope that the Council will side with Parliament in this matter, and that we will in fact be able to retain this employment initiative.   It is equally unacceptable and completely incomprehensible that the Commission wants to make drastic cutbacks of 32% and 18% respectively in the budget headings for the action plans against social exclusion and discrimination, even though social coherence in the European Union is precisely what we are always calling for, and only this morning we again had an extensive debate on the anti-discrimination package. I believe the Commission knows full well that we have no intention of supporting this cutback, and here too we are relying on the joint discussions.   At any event, I hope to see some movement from the Council and the Commission with regard to the points I have mentioned. The same goes for the non-governmental organisations and the budgetary line for health protection in the workplace.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment supports the general rapporteur’s initiative to give employment policy priority once again this year and, more importantly, to give small and medium-sized enterprises support in the field of information and communications technologies. However, the social aspects must, of course, not be forgotten in the process, which is why our Committee is calling for an own initiative, mainly to ensure that everyone has an equal stake in the new technologies. So far, only some 30% of women have access to the Internet and high earners have three times more access to the Internet than low earners. This is not on. There is another important point in this budget. It concerns civil dialogue. We are calling for sustainable financing for civil dialogue and for the non-governmental organisations involved in it, in order to support their important role as the voice of the disadvantaged.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking now as the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I must say that the budget which has now been tabled is indeed a social budget because this time, with our corrections, it takes clear account of employment policy measures. This means that anyone who wants action in favour of families, anyone who wants young trainees to be able to gain experience abroad and anyone who really wants to combat social exclusion will vote in favour of our proposed amendments the day after tomorrow. Anyone who wants the European employment strategy to be paid more than lip service and to be more than an item on Summit agendas but who wants the European employment strategy to be anchored at local level will vote, I am sure, in favour of our new employment policy initiatives. A social Europe also has strong trade union and employer associations in permanent dialogue with each other. It is never too early to start exporting this model of success to Central and Eastern Europe. Which is why we have reversed the Council’s cutbacks here.

 Mr President, today, again, almost everything has been said about the timetable for consideration of the Constitution and of its contents. We welcome the Irish Presidency’s adroitness and its determination to bring about a resolution on the Constitution by the end of June. I agree entirely with Commissioner Vitorino in the demands he has made and the warnings he has given, and can testify that he played an outstanding part in the Convention’s Praesidium, for which he has earned Parliament’s gratitude. What do we need the Constitution for? Only with the Constitution will Europe be equal to its global responsibilities. Without a Constitution, the states of Europe will remain pawns in other powers’ games; only with it will they themselves become players. The Constitution alone will make the European Union stronger, more effective and more democratic, rather than merely larger. Without the Constitution, the EU will progressively degenerate into a customs union. The Constitution alone will enable the EU to become, again, attractive to the public, for Europe will become more comprehensible and more responsible. Without the Constitution, people will lose what is left of their confidence in the future viability of European integration. If it were to fail, it would mean more than just the end of a great hope. Its failure would mean reversion to a Europe of plots and rancour; it would be the beginning of the end for European unity. Centres of gravity, avant-gardes, and multiple speeds – none of these are alternatives; none of them can be a substitute for a constitution. A Union of axes and alliances, of so-called strategic partnerships is not what we need. We must not turn this Europe of ours into a patchwork Union, confusing the citizens at home and discrediting Europe in the eyes of those around us. One of the key words in the Constitution is ‘balance’. That was, and remains, a key to peace and stability in Europe. The states of the old Europe spent centuries in repeated attempts to establish this balance. On the field of diplomacy, they used axes and alliances, and, on the field of battle, blood and iron. The Constitution for the new Europe of the twenty-first century establishes balance by means of the equal participation of all states and the weighting of each of them within shared institutions in a way they can regard as fair. The Constitution for the new Europe replaces the old Europe’s balance of powers by the balance of institutions and by balancing the legitimacy of states and citizens. A new world order is coming into being, not in ten years’ time, but today. If we Europeans do not prepare ourselves now, we will be opting out of world history – first in political terms, and then, inevitably, economically as well. The union of Europeans on the basis of this Constitution is our response to globalisation. History affords no precedent for what we will be doing. It will demand political courage and a firm faith in the future of our old continent. Legally speaking, the Constitution is a Treaty, and replaces the treaties on European Union currently in force, but it does – like every democratic constitution in the world – govern the ways in which power is legitimated and the ways in which it is limited. Politically speaking, the Constitution makes the enlarged European Union more solid, more effective, more responsible, more manageable and more comprehensible, enabling its people to become more familiar with it and to trust it more. Historically speaking, though, the Constitution amounts to nothing less than the re-founding of the European Union, of a Union that is an example to those within it and those outside it, a Union of peace, freedom, and justice.

 Mr President, Taoiseach
, every man and woman here will welcome the fact that you have been able to resurrect the issue of the Constitution. Although it is not a breakthrough, what you have achieved is a really major step forward. You can rely on our support for every further step in the Constitution-making process. There are three matters that still particularly concern us: the first is the qualified majority. We are glad that the principle of the double majority seems to have been accepted. However, in the design of this double majority, the crucial objective is not strengthening the blockade minority, not making it easier to hold the European Union back, but strengthening its capacity for decision-making. Please do not accept shoddy compromises in this area. The second matter is the qualified majority in internal and legal policy. In view of the need to be able to act against the threat of international terrorism, Taoiseach
, it cannot be the objective again to expand unanimity, but the task must be to introduce majority decisions in the area of internal and legal policy also. This is necessary also – but not only – to make the struggle against terrorism more effective. Thirdly, you will be aware of our reservations, our worries and our demands where the European Parliament’s budget rules are concerned; I would like to remind you of them, since the result of the Convention, the Convention draft, is itself a compromise, and one that has not found great favour with this House. However, I say to you now that a Constitution tending to reduce the intrinsic right of any Parliament, namely the right to set the budget, cannot be acceptable to us in the European Parliament. Finally, a particular comment, Taoiseach
, on the Irish presidency: for what you must do in the next three months, there is no better symbol that the Irish harp. This is because all the peoples of Europe are like the strings of a harp; each country with its own tone, but all needing to be plucked if a tune is to be played. Taoiseach
, seize the strings, get your fellow Heads of Government to vibrate and sing! Finish up in June with the tune which all Europeans are expecting, Beethoven's Ode to Joy: ‘Freude, schöner Götterfunken
’! (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we need the Constitution, and we need it for twenty-five of us. All this talk about ‘core Europe’, centres of gravity and multiple speeds is no substitute for the constitution; on the contrary, it leads us astray, into a patchwork Europe of plots and counter-plots, and that we must avoid above all else. Secondly, we need the constitution before the elections, as we have to send out a signal to the voters throughout Europe, who are increasingly impatient for this constitution to be adopted, for we know that nothing will be any easier in the autumn or next year; indeed, everything to do with the constitution will become more difficult. Thirdly, we know perfectly well that we must not have another failed Intergovernmental Conference. It is vital that we succeed this time round, and I support the Irish presidency’s desire to clarify in advance whether we can achieve a positive outcome. Let us, fourthly, stop putting question marks against what came out of Naples. We have traded arguments; we are where we did not always want to be, but this is where we must start from if we are to progress further. I know that most of the Member States are willing to accept Naples in terms of the consensus that the Italian presidency presented. Apart from that, there is one point on which I differ slightly from Mr Brok. Although it is certain that effectiveness is the benchmark, the yardstick of democratic legitimacy must also be applied to the decision-making processes in the European Union. I do think, though, that we will draw a bit closer together on this point in the course of the coming weeks. We will support the Irish presidency with all our might, not only as regards the methods by which it endeavours to achieve consensus, but also in terms of its goal of presenting, in March, a sketch of potential outcomes rather than merely a timetable. Let me conclude with words of hope. After this Monday’s informal meeting there is a little light peeping over the horizon; may it become, under this presidency, a European dawn! (Applause)

Mr President, we can fully endorse two remarks about the draft Constitution and the Intergovernmental Conference made by the President-in-Office of the Council. You spoke, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of the excellent work done by the Convention. Mr Cohn-Bendit mocked your comments. I will take them seriously and at face value. Your words indicate that you will not allow your colleagues at the IGC to destroy that excellent work and again leave it in tatters. We know that the IGC will not adopt the draft text exactly as it stands. Nevertheless, the draft Constitution is more than just a starting point – it is balanced, fair, and contains all the key elements for a solution. In a Union of states and citizens, Mr Poettering, the double majority system forms part of that essential factor: balance. That is why it is included in the draft Constitution, and not to give any Member State an edge. Your second comment, Mr President-in-Office, was that you want to move ahead swiftly. You want to report back in March and we fully support that aim. On this point, Mr Poettering, I agree with you for once. The rumours and prognostications about a two-tier or two-speed system, about centres of gravity and so forth must stop, and the best way to do that is by providing a European Constitution, and fast. (Applause)
 Mr President-in-Office, you expressed your conviction that the European Union needs a Constitution. Obviously, we share that view. However, we do not need any old Constitution; we need the Convention’s proposed text. What is more, we need it now, not just in two or three years’ time. The world and the new challenges it brings is not going to wait for Europe. If I may, I would also like to address Mr Poettering. Mr Poettering, you called for the results of the elections to be taken into account when the next President of the Commission is appointed. I am very happy to hear you speak out so clearly in favour of a Commission President from the ranks of the social democrats. (Applause)

 Mr President, the weekend’s summit is a source of danger for Europe, but I want us to be consistent. For years, we condemned lowest-common-denominator compromises; this time, the lowest common denominator would have been a ‘Nice II’, which would have destroyed the draft constitution. Let me say, therefore, that it is better that the summit should fail than that the draft constitution for Europe should be lost. (Applause)
 We in Europe’s Parliament will not now allow this draft to disappear back into the archives of history. It is still on the table. Working to keep it there will be our first priority in the coming months and years, and we will have to keep working to that end even after the next European elections with our new fellow-Members here in the European Parliament. Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, and we have to face this crisis calmly. We must not allow ourselves to be influenced by soothing words about business as usual. We will overcome crises like this one not by standing still but by getting moving. Where is this danger that hangs over Europe’s future? It does not lie in the possibility of the constitution arriving a couple of years behind schedule. It lies in a new division that is opening up in Europe. In a stronger and united Europe, there are, on the one hand, governments that seek to use it as a means of promoting their national interests and, on the other, there are governments that want to defend their interests against it. This gulf must not be allowed to get any wider; bridging it is our most important task. At the end of the day, the dispute at your summit was about the division of power in Europe, which the world powers have long disregarded. Therein lies the danger facing Europe. While you are in Brussels, fighting tooth and nail over influence, Europe is in the process of losing all influence in the world. Such is the danger of which this summit is the source. (Applause)
 I will dare to say that it is easy to overcome the differences that have become apparent between the governments, but restoring people’s confidence in Europe’s future will be difficult. Yet it is that which will be our task, a task we must accomplish over the coming years and decades, a task in which I wish us all much success. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I would like to give the Italian Council Presidency credit for its intensive efforts, in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, to keep as close as possible to what the Convention produced and also to offer solutions that go beyond that. Let me give two examples: the explicit reference to equal opportunities for women and men as being among the values of the European Union was not of the Convention’s doing. That you should propose it, and that it should be accepted, amounts to progress, and that is something we should make clear. Your proposal that decisions in specific areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy should, subject to certain conditions, be reached by qualified majority voting, goes beyond what the Convention came up with, and that is something I explicitly underline in order to make clear the extraordinarily positive role you play in this. I do, however, have to tell Mr Brok, who is now no longer present, that what you have proposed with regard to the European Central Bank does not interfere with the Bank’s independence. It goes no further than what we want for other areas, that being that decisions on specific technical issues should be capable of being taken by a simplified procedure, and that means that if the Heads of Government want to change something, they have to do so unanimously. Unanimity remains in place; the only thing is that, if we want to sort out technical issues, we do not have to set the whole process of revising the Treaties and the Constitution in motion. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we all see this as a quite crucial point, and I would ask the Council Presidency to see it in that light too. As regards Parliament’s budgetary rights, both in medium-term financial planning and in the annual Budget, we cannot and will not accept less than what we have already. Such a thing cannot be acceptable to a democratically elected parliament, and we will resist it with all the means at our disposal. (Applause)
 I might add that I welcome the unambiguous stance taken up by the Commission on this point. We may well not always be on the same side, but, in this instance, Mr President of the Commission, we are glad of your support, for our allies are thin on the ground where this is concerned. I am glad that you are numbered among them, as also is the Presidency of the Council. There is one final point that I would like to address. I, too, have my criticisms of Naples. Like Mr Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, I came away from Naples more depressed than I was when I went there. My worry is that we are leaving open many issues that will then be squeezed into the package for the Heads of State or Government, and that we will then end up with a repeat of this ‘night of Nice’ and its compromise, not merely on the lowest common denominator, but with a collection of compromises, completely unrelated and mutually contradictory. The danger of a repeat performance of Nice in Brussels on 13 December has become greater since Naples. My fear is that we will then end up with this peculiar ‘rendezvous clause’. For over ten years, ever since Maastricht, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that really has been the customary flight response of the Heads of State or Government. At Maastricht, we said that we needed the political unification of Europe. We postponed it, deciding that we would do it later. Then we had Amsterdam, and then its celebrated leftovers. They were then deferred until Nice, where you could not sort it out, and so we passed it on to the Convention. Now the Convention has come up with a proposal. Please, I beg you, Mr President-in-Office, do not do the same thing again! The situation is getting no better. If there are more leftovers from any decision taken on 13 December, then the European public as a whole will see that as a failure on the part of the European Union’s Heads of State or Government. Mr President-in-Office, I urge you to prevent such a failure. They will be judged not only on their ability to achieve a result, but also to propagate a solution – and so will you. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would specifically like to thank the Italian Presidency for all its efforts to ensure that the result of the Intergovernmental Conference closely reflects the draft Constitutional Treaty. It will have our support, and it will also have the support of some governments, but far too few up to now. We would like to see this group growing larger. Nevertheless I share the concern expressed here by Commissioner Verheugen and also by you yourself, Mr President-in-Office. I share your concern but I do not want to go into individual proposals. I am concerned about something more fundamental that is amiss in the Intergovernmental Conference. The majority of ministers have not so far proved equal to the task before them. That is the simple truth. There is no will to shape things in the Intergovernmental Conference, but rather a blocking mentality, and that cannot continue if we are to achieve a good result in December. Almost without exception, the proposals being made represent steps backward as compared with the Convention's draft. Every time, during every discussion, the IGC does not build on the result of the Convention, it goes back on the Convention. The ministers are in the process of making things that have been dealt with simply in the draft Constitutional Treaty complicated again and detracting from their clarity and simplicity. The rejection of the Legislative Council is just one example of this. They are refusing to give the Constitution the flexibility it needs. In fact they are going even further, by dismantling the small number of modest links that we incorporated and blocking them, so that unanimous agreement is to be required again for the medium-term financial perspective, and the European Parliament is being deprived of budgetary rights. In this way they are not just going back on the Convention's draft, they are even going back on the European Parliament's present rights. That is unacceptable. The majority of governments do not understand that a Union with over 25 Member States needs to have a new basis. They are not taking the result of the Convention seriously as a compromise that really is already a compromise and strikes a balance between North and South, large and small, and East and West in the European Union. We hope that the governments will abandon their blocking mentality and remember that they should be a force for shaping the future of Europe. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Giscard d'Estaing, our work in the Convention was not always free of conflicts – and nor, indeed, was the work of the praesidium – but we agreed on our objective, which was to create one single text for a European constitution, and in that we succeeded. We followed the wise counsel of Jean Monnet, who said that writing down what should be is easy, but that what matters is writing down what can be. The Convention did precisely that. What we are putting before the governments is well-considered, balanced, and, above all, achievable if we have the will to do it. Previous Intergovernmental Conferences and EU summits have always made themselves the yardstick for success or the lack of it. That now belongs in the past. The results of the Rome Intergovernmental Conference will be measured against those of the Convention. That, ladies and gentlemen, is our success. We have not managed to achieve everything that we wanted, and not all of what has been achieved can be counted an undoubted success. We would have liked all future laws – including especially those on taxation – to be decided on by qualified majority in the Council. We would have liked the Common Foreign and Security Policy to be another area in which the Member States would reach decisions by qualified majority. We know how fragile some solutions are, the compromise on the size of the Commission and on voting in it being one example. All this is on the outermost boundary of constitutional good sense. We also know, however, that what is described therein is a compromise and not, moreover, one reached on the lowest common denominator. This draft constitution has not become a mere list of compromises, but has remained an internally coherent piece of legislation, and so we must resist all temptations to repackage these compromises. The governments were represented at the Convention. They had a hand in what was finally agreed on. The desire of some of them to withdraw from this consensus not only fills me with concern, but it is also dangerous. The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, that we will not end up with a new and better draft, but with a second Treaty of Nice. That is something we have to prevent. (Applause)
 The Commission’s evident willingness to play along with this leaves me astonished and baffled. (Applause)
 Do you really believe, Mr President of the Commission, that what you have said here has not also been said and discussed in the Convention? Do you believe that the Commission’s delegates did not put these ideas forward when they sat in the praesidium and the Convention? What you and they desire is perhaps the right thing, but you will get the wrong result. What you have put forward will result in nothing more than a return to the old, traditional Intergovernmental Conference, to the same old horse-trading that we saw at Intergovernmental Conferences in the past. Do not imagine that you will gain support for this, Mr President of the Commission, so abandon your game. What the Convention has built up, you are pulling apart. (Applause)
 Finally, once this Intergovernmental Conference is over – and we hope it will be a success – I can only urge and implore Mr Fini and Mr Frattini, whose statements I welcome, to stand by what they said, to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference makes this draft Europe’s constitution; then, ladies and gentlemen, let us mobilise the people in our Member States. Let us then tell them what is unique about what the Convention has brought forth, a constitution for so many states and peoples, separated from one another for half a century by the division of Europe and by Communist dictatorship, given by this Convention their first opportunity to play their part, through their representatives, in shaping Europe’s future. To our parliamentary counterparts from the East, from Central and Southern Europe, who took part for the first time, I have this to say: not only did you follow the work that was done, but you gave something to the Convention! (Applause)
 For it is unique, this constitution for twenty-five – and more – states and peoples who, for centuries, have robbed and killed each other, waged war on one another and laid each other waste, and who now want to join together in shaping the future. It is a constitution for twenty-five – and more – peoples, each with their own traditions, tongues and histories, all desirous of retaining their identities, yet uniting in a common destiny. That is the great thing about this draft constitution. That is the great thing about the unification of Europe, to which we must hold fast and with which we must press on. That responsibility is ours. We face the same situation as did the fathers and mothers of Europe’s unification in the 1950s. By joining in a European Community, they were courageous and far-sighted enough to set aside the thousand-year enmity between Germany and France and to make a start on uniting Western Europe. We, as politicians of our generation, have, for the first time in a millennium, the opportunity to unite the whole continent in freedom and peace. We must summon up the same courage and far-sightedness as did the founding fathers of European unity fifty years ago. That, ladies and gentlemen, is our destiny. (Applause)

 Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the consensus on the draft Constitution which we reached in the Convention last Friday has been described as historic, and indeed it is – for look at what has been achieved. We have drafted a Constitution for over 25 sovereign states and peoples who, for centuries, were pitched head-to-head in plunder, war and devastation. That is without parallel in history. We have drafted a Constitution for a multitude of peoples and states who all have long histories of their own, who speak different languages, who maintain their own identity and yet who want to shape their destinies together. That is without precedent in the history of Europe and the world. What is new about it? I would like to mention just six points which I think are especially important. Firstly, the Constitution sets forth the rights and duties of citizens. We have made the Charter of Fundamental Rights an integral and legally binding element of the European Constitution. Secondly, the famous ‘four freedoms’ of the Treaty of Rome were also promises for the future. Today, these promises have been fulfilled. The new Constitution contains a new pledge in Article 2 and Article 3, namely sustainable development, justice, security and solidarity for Europe’s citizens. Thirdly, the most important contribution to democracy and to the ‘ownership’ of European policies is clarity. Citizens must be able to identify which areas can be regulated by the European Union and which cannot. They must also be able to identify who bears responsibility for political decisions and who does not. In this respect, the Constitution makes significant progress. We have created a division of competences which, for the first time, defines the competences between the Member States and the European Union more clearly than before, and I would remind the older Members of this House that Parliament has failed twice in the past to achieve this goal. We have greatly simplified and reduced the number of decision-making procedures. Fourthly, the European Parliament: codecision on matters of legislation will be the rule in future. Today it is the exception, but in future, it will be the rule, and that is a quantum leap compared with the current situation. After all, the President of the Commission will be elected by this Parliament. This enhances his political legitimacy and will increase the importance of the European elections. Fifthly, we have tackled the issue of institutional balance. We have strengthened all three institutions: the European Parliament, of course, but also the Commission, especially the Commission President, whose role is considerably enhanced, and we have also strengthened the Council, in the person of the President of the European Council. Sixthly, the European Union is not a global power, but it has a global power's responsibility. At present, it cannot do justice to this responsibility, but we have tried to ensure that it can do so in future. We have created the position of a European Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, we realise that simply creating this position certainly does not achieve commonality on foreign, security and defence policy issues. That cannot be regulated by a decision; it is a process, and the position of Foreign Minister will have to ensure that this process towards commonality is initiated and kept on track. Finally, I would like to point out that there were no models for what we have drafted. This constitution cannot be a copy of any nation-state's constitution. The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century. We had to reinvent ourselves in the Convention, not only in substantive terms: we also had to reinvent our working methods. We have not always achieved what we set out to achieve, but no Intergovernmental Conference since the Treaty of Rome has produced such significant changes, with such a far-reaching impact, as those now envisaged by the Constitution. With this Constitution, we can put the European Union, the 50-year-old organisation of European states, on a new footing. Treaties are based on mistrust born of past experience. Constitutions are based on confidence in the future, and with this Constitution, the citizens of Europe are linking their destinies to create a better future. Let us, here in the European Parliament, clear the way for this process and make sure that the governments face up to their European responsibility. (Applause)

Mr President, I am cautious about drawing historical comparisons, but it is appropriate to do so today. A generation of politicians in the Fifties – Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Alcide De Gasperi, Paul-Henri Spaak and others – had the courage and the vision to establish a European Community that would overcome a thousand years of antagonism between Germany and France and begin the unification of Europe in the West. We, the present political generation, have the opportunity, for the first time in a thousand years, to bring the continent together by peaceful means and on a voluntary basis into a European Union, a union of freedom, peace and prosperity. If we do not seize this opportunity, we will be failing in our historic mission. (Applause)
 The resolution of the European Parliament on the reunification of Europe will be adopted in one day, but the unification of the whole of Europe is a process, the task of an entire generation of politicians. Its accomplishment demands strenuous efforts, not only on the part of the acceding countries but also on that of the present Member States, for the Union is not simply becoming larger – it is also becoming a different Union. The new Member States will be more than a numerical addition to the membership of the present Union; they will give the European Union a new character. As they themselves are well aware, they are not only entering a market but are also acceding to a union whose desire and obligation it is to become a political union. They are joining in the Convention's work of building firmer foundations for this. For both the old and the new Member States, membership of the Union confers rights but also imposes responsibilities, in particular the duty to work with all available means on the development and consolidation of our common future for the benefit of all, for the good of the whole Union, and not just to increase their own store. Old Europe has fixed its eyes on a new future. Today we are giving it the green light, and I am deeply grateful to be able to play a part in this. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we have been calling for a Commission proposal to solve the institutional problems that exist. It is at long last before us, and we welcome that. Your paper makes a further interesting and important contribution to the work of the Convention, but it does not provide a total solution for all institutional problems. It does cast some light on the Commission's position regarding a whole raft of issues. For example, majority voting in the Council as a general rule, which we welcome. Majority voting by Parliament on legislation as a general rule, which we also welcome. Bringing justice and home affairs within the Community framework, which is also good, and the creation of a Secretary of the Union for foreign affairs as Vice-President of the Commission with a special relationship with the Council, that is fine, and it represents a workable compromise as a means of solving a difficult problem. And there is much more besides. I can see many positive points in your proposals. However, in some areas, Mr Prodi, your proposals do not make things clearer – they just create greater confusion. Let me pick out one of them in particular. This is the issue of the appointment and political responsibility of the Commission. You are suggesting that the European Parliament should elect the President of the Commission. That is a good proposal, and a much-needed step forward. But at the same time you say that this President of the Commission must be elected by a two-thirds majority of the European Parliament, which prevents the results of the European elections from being reflected in a decision regarding an appointment at European Union level. In other words it prevents something from happening that is precisely what you want: it prevents voters from deciding who they want as Commission President for the next five years. This means building in a permanent compromise, rather like the permanent grand coalition in Austria. We cannot and we will not go along with that! The second issue is that the European Council is to confirm the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament. How is that to happen? By a majority or unanimously? What do you have in mind? And if the Council does not confirm the President, what then? Does Parliament have the right to dissolve the Council? That is what I would suggest. Your proposals do not include any mechanisms for resolving conflicts. Ultimately, and this really takes the biscuit, the Commission is accountable to both Parliament and the Council. So how will that work out in practice? Will you resign every time? If Parliament says that it has confidence in you, will you stay, and if the Council says you must resign, will you resign? What sort of message does that send about building the institutions of the European Union? It is simply a recipe for confusion! Mr President of the Commission, your proposal in this respect creates more problems than it solves, and the European Parliament regards what you want to tell us is a step forward as actually being two steps back! (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament wanted this Convention, and now we have got it. We share in this success, and have you to thank for it having been possible. The Convention's flaws have been alluded to here several times, but we can and will take care that these blemishes are insignificant and will be forgotten by the time the work is done. My second remark follows on from what Mr Nassauer said: the Convention puts Parliament, too, in a new position of responsibility. The reform of the institutions is, for the first time, in our hands too. We bear responsibility no longer only for the demands and visions that we develop here, but also for the compromises and results. That is something new and we will have to get used to it. (Applause)
 My third point is that the Convention has been given the broad mandate we wanted it to have. That is an opportunity and a danger in equal measure. The Convention must not turn itself into an expanded Intergovernmental Conference, but likewise it must not reduce itself to the level of being just a forum for discussion. It must work towards broad consensus and must concentrate its attention on those strategic proposals for reform that point the way ahead to future developments and open up the road that leads to them. Fourthly, the word ‘constitution’ is now to be found for the first time in an official Council document, which is quite something. It is not certain whether a draft constitution will be the final result, but what we can be sure of is that the Convention must direct all its efforts at what we – borrowing the expression of that great European, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant – might call the Convention's categorical imperative, that every one of its proposals must also be capable of becoming a basic component of a European constitution. It is towards that goal that it must work. Fifthly, Europe is becoming ever more important, yet of decreasing interest to its own citizens. They are, admittedly, not yet opposed to the European Union, but they are no longer so sure why they are meant to be in favour of it. We want Europe's citizens to regain the knowledge of why we are uniting Europe. The European Union must stand for a European model of society and for a European world vision. What we are about is Europe's self-assertion – economic, political and, not least, cultural – and the preservation of a European way of life! This has acquired an added dimension since 11 September. The EU could be sunk by this new challenge, but it could grow through it – indeed, I am quite sure that it will. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are Europe's tasks in these times? First, Europe must support the victim against the aggressor. We hold to our treaty commitments. We salute the firm and considered attitude of the United States government. We also welcome the European Council's expression of solidarity with the USA. All of you must make it your concern that Europe is not divided into doves and hawks! Secondly, the European Union must play its part in forging a worldwide political alliance against terrorism. We appreciate what you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, have undertaken not only in the Arab countries but also in Russia. We ask that you continue your efforts as intermediaries in the Middle East, above all between Israel and the Palestinians. They are in the best interests of us all. Thirdly, we must, join together in reinforcing our internal security. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is regrettable that the European Council, and the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers as well, have only now got around to partially implementing plans that already existed and had been thoroughly worked out. We expect action against terrorism, not reactions to terrorist attacks. In doing this, Europe must continue to be an example of how to maintain the balance between the right to individual liberty and the security of all. Fourthly, we want Europeans not to be distracted from their common commitment to a more just world order, in which law for all replaces force exerted by the few. We are not making this effort for a more just world order solely out of a belief that we will thereby be depriving terrorism of its breeding ground. On the contrary, we seek a more just world order because that reflects our values and our dignity as Europeans – a dignity we share with all the peoples of the earth! Fifthly, if it is true to say that the world is no longer what it was before 11 September, then the European Union cannot stay as it is. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome your intentions for Ghent and Laeken. We hope they do not remain only as intentions but that what you have put before us will indeed become the opinion of the Fifteen and a basis for our further work. Europe could be broken by the crisis now facing the world. It could, though, equally, emerge stronger from it. It is at this crossroads that you and all of us will be standing in Ghent and Laeken. In this crisis, Europe can – and I would add – must show its citizens what the European Union is really worth. By this yardstick you and all of us will be judged. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if anyone is looking for a juicy bit of controversy between Parliament and the Commission or Parliament and the Council, or even a juicy bit of controversy between the major parties here, I have to disappoint them. We all want and continue to want to make enlargement a success and it is not a matter for party political sabre rattling, Mr Poettering. I therefore have no difficulty in signalling to Mr Brok and everyone else that my group will be voting in favour of the resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the enlargement reports and in fact all the country reports. There may be a difference of emphasis here or there, but over all both the resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the country reports satisfy my group’s principles and criteria for the continuation of the enlargement process. We also agree with, and support, the Commission’s strategy as explained by Mr Verheugen today. We stick firmly to the principle of merit for the conclusion of negotiations with the candidate countries, and we also agree to your plan of saying that by 2004 ten candidate countries may have managed to conclude negotiations according to our criteria. It need not be 10, but it may be 10. We are prepared for that. We also agree with attention being shifted in future reports from the transposition of EU law to the application and enforcement of EU law. That is, in fact, one of the most important points that we must make clear and stick to until the accession treaties are concluded. But we understand the target date not just as a window of opportunity for the accession countries. We also see the target date of 2004 as a means of applying pressure on the Member States themselves not only to pay attention to how and to what extent the candidates are solving their problems but also to ensure that the Member States themselves do not create new problems for accession. And that is the rub if we have set our eyes on the year 2004 as the target date. Of course – and here I support what Mr Verheugen, Mr Brok and Mr Poettering have said – we shall talk about the risks, the burdens and the deficits of the present enlargement process. There are many points there. But if we want to win the people of Europe over to support what we are planning and what we have to do, we must not speak only about burdens and risks. We must also speak about what all of us in Europe stand to gain from enlargement. Then let us talk about how reform of the common agricultural policy is naturally about financing and about reform. That is correct. But let us also say that it is about strengthening consumer protection in Europe. Let us say that the security of the Union’s food supply will be preserved and must be further strengthened after enlargement. Let us say that enlargement presents no risk to environmental protection, on the contrary that in a few years’ time EU standards will apply in the whole of Europe and not just in the western part. That is an advantage for us, too, not just for the east Europeans. Let us make clear to the people in the EU that we can fight international crime and corruption better in the European Union than if the countries of eastern Europe are left outside, if the laws we have created to fight international crime also apply in eastern Europe. Let us talk about how enlargement will benefit us all because we will carry more political, economic and also ecological weight in the world, in a world that is becoming increasingly globalised. That in Europe together we will have more chance of meeting the challenges of globalisation than if we in Europe diverge into east and west or north and south. And economic and social cohesion, social solidarity in Europe will extend to Europe as a whole, and that is an advantage not only for the east, it is an advantage for us as well. Funding up until 2006 is secured. But that does not mean that enlargement will come at no cost. Most surely not. It has its price. But non-enlargement is expensive, too. It costs much more than enlargement. Its price is economic, social, ecological and political stability in Europe, above all else its price is trust. Failure to enlarge will deprive Europe of its future. Basically, we are on the point of taking a step comparable to the situation in 1989/1990 for the whole of Europe. What is at stake is not merely one or other transitional period, not that this or that project or programme or fund will work better or worse. Neither is it only about this or that advantage for one country or another. It is about something very simple: It is about the future of all Europeans. And there we are only at the start of the debate. After the failure of Nice we are also setting great hopes on the Belgian Presidency. This debate about the future of Europe must not be conducted only in the Member States, it must also be conducted in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in Cyprus and Malta. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I have three brief comments to make. First, the initial stage should involve both public debate – I agree with the comments made on this by Mr Swoboda and Mr Brok – and it should involve the planned Laeken declaration. I have a very straightforward question to put to you: are you – the Commission – ready and will we manage this year, in 2001, to present a common Commission and Parliament proposal for Laeken on the subsequent structure of the post-Nice process? That is my first question, which concerns the method. As regards my second point, I was delighted to hear you say that we must set up a committee to involve governments, the Commission, the European Parliament and the national parliaments. We want a convention to move the post-Nice process forward, a convention which is the centre of gravity for public debate, i.e. which sends and receives proposals and, at the same time, presents a clear proposal for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the issues which will need to be negotiated in 2004. My third point relates to the subjects. Four subjects are planned, which is both fine and feasible; but we all know that it is not just these subjects which need to be clarified and that much more is and must be at stake for 2004. I would advise each and everyone of us to get away from this strange ‘post-Nice’ concept. Post-Nice is not what it is about. Nice is not only the end of a method, Nice is also the end of an era , the era of the European unification process of the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s. Now what we have to do is to prepare the ground for a new European Union, a European Union of the twenty-first century. It is not about the post-Nice process, it is about standing on the verge of a renewed European unification process and we must make this clear. If we want to convince public opinion, public debate, the people and the citizens of the merits of our objective of European unification, then starting a post-Nice process is not enough; on the contrary, we must ensure that the people understand that we are talking about a new European Union in a new Europe, a Europe which has changed since 1990. (Applause)
Hänsch (PSE

Mr President, the results of Nice are disappointing, unsatisfactory and petty. The Union's ability to act on decisive matters has not been improved. The outcome of the compromises brokered in Nice is not more transparency, it is more cover-up. The democratic credibility of European policy has not been enhanced; on the contrary, the door has been opened to the insidious intergovernmentalisation of European policy and, by extension, to even greater bureaucratisation. We shall, of course, have the post-Nice process – that, at least, is a faint light at the end of the tunnel and we must not underestimate it. Enlargement has given you, has given us all the same task as Monnet and Schuman had fifty years ago: the task of developing a method, structure and vision for the future of Europe. At that time, this applied to half of Europe; now we must develop it for all of Europe. Enlargement would be a chance to do so, a chance, Mr President-in-Office, which you missed in Nice. That is my main criticism of you. It may well be that Nice prepares the EU for enlargement numerically. But the historic failing of Nice is that your resolutions are not based on any identifiable vision for a Union of 27 Member States. It is this spirit, the spirit of Monnet, Schuman and others, which was missing in Nice and which was sorely needed. Instead, the spirit of Nice clearly amounted to wondering how to block, how to intergovernmentalise, how to be feted at home as the defender of national interests, rather than how to take the European Union forward. If Monnet, Schuman, Adenauer, de Gasperi et al 
had acted thus, we would never have had European Communities and, as a result, we would still not have European Union. President Chirac referred to Heads of Government who point out that public opinion still does not understand or accept more or a different sort of progress. That may well be. But that is because, that is mainly because none of the heads of government has the courage to lead and educate public opinion pro-actively, rather than running along behind it. What is heart-breaking about Europe is that so few of its many leaders are prepared to risk their political career by standing or falling by the unification of Europe. (Applause)

 Madam President, the importance of the situation with which we are faced after Nice is such that I do not believe that Parliament should allow itself to be divided on the technical question of whether to have a resolution or not. This technicality is not sufficiently important. It is true that in this week directly following the events in Nice we in Parliament should send out a clear signal. We could do this, as Mr Cox has proposed, through the debate alone. But the tradition of this Parliament has it that we usually choose to do this by way of a resolution. (Applause)
 I have listened very carefully to what Mr Poettering, Mr Brok and others have said; all that this is about is issuing a first opinion. It is not about casting Parliament's position in stone… (Applause)
 but about saying that we will do so after an in-depth examination of the matter by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This will happen within the next one or two months. Then this Parliament will lay down its opinion – yes or no or maybe – as it always does. This would also make it possible – and I have agreed this with the Chairman of my group – for me to vote in favour of a resolution of this kind this week. I believe that this would also allow the necessary agreement to be reached, if we say that we are making a statement, but that Parliament reserves its judgment and final position until its committee has tabled the report.

 Mr President, Mr Brok's report is an excellent description of the European Parliament's position. My group will give it its unanimous support. This debate is a further opportunity for my group to reaffirm its view that the accession of the central and eastern European countries, but also of Cyprus and Malta, is the best way of safeguarding the future for all of us in Europe both in the East and in the West. The sooner we achieve this, the better it will be for all of us. You will realise that we do not only agree with Mr Brok's report, but that I also agree with much of what he said here and, incidentally, also with what Mr van Velzen said. This is no accident, because it shows that the large groups in this House and the vast majority of this House are acting in concert where this issue of the future of the European Union is concerned, and that we all agree that we want the same thing. We acknowledge the huge efforts which the central and eastern European countries are making to be ready for accession. We welcome the progress which they have made in the past months and years. We know that there are large disparities. But these disparities are also related to the different starting points at which they began the process of converging with the European Union.  We know that the central and eastern European countries will not be able to meet all of the EU's standards by the day of accession. Transitional periods will therefore have to be agreed. Different sectors will require different transitional periods. This is in their interests, but also in ours. We insist – incidentally as Commissioner Verheugen also did – that these transitional periods be kept as short as possible. Transitional periods are possible and necessary, for example for the free movement of capital, for the free movement of workers, for meeting certain environmental standards which require major investment and for a series of other points.  We will be able to support all of this and we also want to support it. But one point is clear – and I welcome the fact that Mr Verheugen has underlined this once more: there can be no transitional period for complying with democratic rules. Neither can there be a transitional period for securing the external borders if we want to have open borders within the European Union. Any country joining the EU must also want to join the monetary union. There can and must be no opting out. I am saying this expressly with last week's Danish referendum in mind. But neither must there be any waiver from meeting the Maastricht criteria. Only those which meet the criteria – as they have stood up until now – can introduce the euro; this also applies to all of the current Member States which are introducing the euro. There must be no waivers there either. My group would also like to emphasise one further point: the future Member States have undertaken to decommission first-generation nuclear power stations of Soviet design. This undertaking – which they themselves entered into – must be carried out, and this by accession to the European Union.  The progress and efforts being made in central and eastern Europe give us hope that the first accession treaties will still be able to be ratified in the European Parliament in this parliamentary term. I am convinced that we can manage this and also that we should manage it. It does presuppose, however, that the European Union will keep its own promise to be ready for enlargement from 1 January 2003. Nice must deliver a substantial reform of the institutions of the European Union. Like everyone else here, I am very grateful that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, but also the President-in-Office, Mr Moscovici, made it clear this morning that it is substantial reforms that we are talking about and not simply tweaking the rules of one or other institution. Nevertheless, we also know that in Nice the maximum achievable will be less than the minimum necessary. This means we know that the reforms will continue and must continue after Nice. But we do not want additional hurdles to accession to be set up either in Nice or afterwards. This means that if we want further reform then the structure of the enlarged Union will only be found in the enlarged Union and by the enlarged Union. Being ready for enlargement is not only about reforming the institutions of the European Union but also about the support of its people. And we all know that they have fears, worries, hesitations and questions: what will enlargement cost? Yes, it is true that enlargement is not free; it does not come free of charge. Yes, it is true: after 2006 it will be necessary to reform the Structural Funds and the support available under the Structural Funds. But it is also true that in the financial perspective up to 2006 EUR 68 billion is provided for; no less, but no more either. I am very grateful that Commissioner Verheugen has made this very clear once more. But if we say this, then surely we must also say that in 1999 the EU achieved an export surplus of EUR 19 billion in trade with the accession countries, and up to 2006 – for the duration of the financial perspective – that makes EUR 90 billion, and that compared with the costs of EUR 68 billion which we have committed for our part in the financial perspective. With this EUR 90 billion the eastern Europeans, not us, are funding tens of thousands of jobs in the European Union. This too is part of the debate on enlargement. (Applause)
 So, let us not always only talk about the costs of enlargement; let us also talk about the costs of non-enlargement. And that is why we call on the Commission to table a study, a kind of Cecchini report, on what non-enlargement would cost. This too would be a useful and important input into the public debate. Enlargement is not purely a cost-benefit issue. It was the Polish trade union movement Solidarnosc; it was the Hungarian Government which opened the Hungarian borders; it was the Czechoslovak Government which opened up its country. All of them have made the reunification of Europe possible. And today, on the German national holiday, I say it with particular emotion: they also made the reunification of my country possible. And that is why we have the moral and historic duty to make a success of the accession of the peoples of central and eastern Europe to the European Union. I am sure that we will manage it, because we must! (Applause)

 Madam President, President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, you said just now that your comments in the interview were made in a German context, but it is far from being an internal German issue. And even though Mr Poettering has just spoken, and now I am taking the floor, do not think that this is an all-German debate. The comments you made, Mr Verheugen, provoked amazement, irritation and also anger amongst the Socialist Group. (Applause)
 This is not about the worth or lack of worth of referenda in terms of democracy, or involving the people in the decisions of the European Union. Nor do I intend, as speaker for my group, to go into the internal German debate on such referenda and similar issues. Naturally, each Member State will decide on the accession of new States according to its own constitutional law, and the same applies to Germany. But precisely because the German constitution makes no provision for a referendum of this kind, your comments were interpreted as a call for a referendum to be introduced, and as such, as an attempt to postpone the eastward enlargement of the European Union. I know this was far from being your intention, Commissioner, but that is the impression people got and it must be dispelled! (Applause)
 The Socialist Group wants the European Union to honour the commitment it has entered into with regard to Eastern Europe. We want the negotiations to be resolved speedily and diligently. We reject any attempt to put new obstacles in the way of accession. But the same applies to comments made by certain members of your group, Mr Poettering; for example with regard to the PPE’s attitude towards accession to the Economic and Monetary Union. (Applause)
 My group, the socialist group, welcomes the fact that President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have made the necessary clarifications here today, and we are grateful to you for this. You have clarified matters to our satisfaction. Now, of course, we could say: "Romano" locuto, causa finita.
 (Laughter)
 But of course things are not that simple, because the fundamental problem, Commissioner Verheugen, is one we all face: i.e. the Commission, MEPs, national governments, and the parties in our Member States. The fundamental problem is how we go about informing EU citizens about the accession of East European States, how we convince them and win their support for these accessions. That is the key objective. However, we are all to be found wanting in this respect. The only way to achieve this aim is to impress on the people that the size of the task is commensurate with the size of the opportunity presented to us all in Europe. That is the message we must drive home. To this end, you, President Prodi, and you Commissioner, and all of us, must stop getting bogged down in bureaucratic detail and doubts. Let us give our work the epoch-making status it deserves! The political generation of the fifties – Adenauer, Monnet, Schuman and so on –, had the courage and vision to resolve the centuries’ old conflict between Germany and France in a European Community, and to make a start on unifying the people of Europe. Our generation of politicians, ladies and gentlemen, yours and mine, now has the opportunity, for the first time in a thousand years, to bring all the people of Europe together in one Community, based on free will, peace and democracy. We must not allow anyone to wreck this opportunity, nor must we waste it. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Poettering spoke here as a group chairman and not as a German. I am speaking here as a German and as the acting chairman of my group. Commissioner Patten has already outlined the Commission's views on Mr Verheugen's comments. For me, that would actually suffice as a Commission position. My group has always believed that not only the Commission as a whole but also all of the individual Commissioners must justify themselves before this Parliament, and this regardless of their nationality and regardless of any affiliation to a political party. That is why we would welcome Mr Verheugen's being given the opportunity this week to clarify his remarks here before the European Parliament and, if necessary, also to amend them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French President has introduced the French Presidency’s substantial programme to us today and it would be impossible for me to cover even a fraction of the points in four minutes. But what I would say is that, as I see it, there are three aspects which the French Presidency is going to successfully take forward. Firstly, it will raise the profile of the 11, or soon to be 12, Members of the euro-zone. This will entail providing our single currency with political support, and I have every sympathy for the French Council Presidency’s desire to raise the profile of this political support for the euro whilst fully upholding the independence of the European Central Bank. What is more, if we were to coordinate budgetary policy and harmonise taxation policy more effectively, it would help to stabilise the single currency.   But I would add that if we were to strengthen the euro-zone in this way, then this would be a topical example, and also one of the most important examples, as it were, of reinforced cooperation within the context of the Treaty. That is absolutely fine. But then I would also want to see France acting with true pioneering spirit, although in matters pertaining to the implementation of the directive on the internal market, France belongs to the rearguard. After all, we have some catching up to do there, particularly where the implementation of Community legislation in France is concerned. France, along with Greece, Portugal and Luxembourg are in the rearguard on this count, and not the vanguard. I would be only too pleased for it to be otherwise.   My second point concerns reinforced cooperation in the construction of a European Union of security and defence. I wholeheartedly agree with you when you say that the European Union must have all the means and instruments at its disposal that it needs to pursue a truly common foreign and security policy worthy of the name, which also means strengthening our military capability and establishing the political and military structures we need for a common foreign and security policy.   Of course my third point concerns the agreement reached by the 15 Member States in Nice on reforming the institutions and the decision-making processes within the European Union. I have two fundamental comments to make in this connection. Our aim, from which we must not be deflected, must be to preserve the unity of the institutions. The European Union does not need new institutions, it needs institutions that operate better and are able to make decisions more effectively than is the case at present. That is one aspect, and the second is this: although it may be true that as a European Parliament we could have wished for a broader agenda, it is more important to make substantial progress in the points that are on the agenda now. The future size of the Commission is important in this respect, but it is not central. The new weighting of votes in the Council is also important for striking a new balance between large and small, North and South and rich and poor within the Union, but that is not crucial either. The spotlight is on the extension of majority voting. I would hope, assuming France and Germany have already moved closer together – which I welcome with open arms of course that these two countries will stick together over the issue of extending majority voting in the Council, and set an example, so as to progress beyond the status quo, because so far, the 15 have been able to reach agreement on just two areas.   President-in-Office of the Council, majority decisions in the Council imply co-decision rights for the European Parliament. There must be an inextricable link between the extension of majority decisions and the grant of co-decision rights to the European Parliament over the European Union’s entire legislative programme.

 Madam President, the first thing I wish to say is that I think it would be unworthy of the European Parliament to be at loggerheads over this issue. We should not be presenting the public with a spectacle of that kind. (Applause)
 My second point is that you decided, on the basis of Rule 7(4), to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. That is your right. However, if I have understood correctly, we do not have a proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee as a basis for a vote, but you did ask the Committee on Legal Affairs for its opinion. There is a legal problem here that only you can clear up. I have in mind the difference between Article 12 of the Act on the election of Members by direct universal suffrage and Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure. There is a discrepancy here. My advice is that we need to clear up this discrepancy. That is your task, Madam President. There is nothing we can vote on until you have cleared this up with the Committee on Legal Affairs.  (Applause)
 My advice is therefore that we should not hold a vote today, but that we should await your decision, Madam President. (Applause)

 Madam President, if I have been informed correctly, the Council has postponed its statement on Iraq and it will not now be made this week.

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010? Have you already included your second term of office? (Laughter)
 But seriously. As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation. First, streamlining. What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning. The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy. In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally. It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important. Secondly, the new “in” word is flexibility. However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation. We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States. That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step. Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers. (Applause)
 Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right. That is transparency. Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly. Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate. (Applause)
 If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid. It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union. There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone. But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies. That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life. Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together. In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union. (Applause)

 Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion. You did not call me either. I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.
Hänsch (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, an historic decision has indeed been taken in Helsinki. It is a cheque made out to the future and, to be frank, neither you nor we know how we can honour it. After the unanimous vote on the enlargement process, no further doubt can or will be cast on the seriousness of our intentions and of Turkey’s intention to meet the Copenhagen criteria as quickly as possible. It is the will of the Helsinki Summit that the European Union should number 28 Member States in a few years’ time. However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, a number of questions then arise as to the scope of the decisions which have been taken. Do you really believe that, once the Amsterdam leftovers have been cleared up, our Union will still have the power to act and will still be transparent and democratic with 27 or 28 Member States? Do you really believe that we can maintain the present language rules in our institutions with 15, 16, 17 or 18 languages? Do you believe that we can maintain the present internal modus operandi of our institutions, of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission and the balance between them with 27 or 28 Member States? Do you really believe that Turkey, the European country with the largest population and a long history its own, will merely join the European Union as its 28th Member State rather than changing the very nature of it? Do we not need a plan for moving the Schengen borders to the Euphrates and Tigris? Do we not need a plan for dealing with accession applications received by the European Union from the States of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus in the wake of the Helsinki decision? And for dealing with Russia if we receive accession applications from the States of that region? I trust that we will find the flexibility within the European Union, the flexibility which has so far completely eluded us – what we previously described as flexibility notwithstanding – in order to safeguard the cohesion of the European Union. I trust that we shall, over coming years, find the strength and the courage to answer these questions and to find answers of our own before others find them for us.

Mr President, the whole house agrees with Mrs Halonen: Helsinki must inject new life into the process of enlargement of the European Union. The individual negotiations which we want to conduct with 12 applicant countries should not become mere routine. The last Intergovernmental Conference of the century marks the end of a millennium of European wars and you must ensure, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that the foundations are laid so that there will never again be another millennium of wars in Europe. That is the aim of enlargement, to unite the whole of Europe in a European Union. Mrs Halonen, we support what you have said regarding the negotiations and how they are to be conducted and are also in agreement with what Mr Prodi has said on the matter. We find that all well and good, but what you have said about the preparation of accession, about the so-called Amsterdam leftovers
, that is not enough for us. We want comprehensive reform of the European Union. If we are to open the doors of the European house, of our European Union, in order to take in another 12 lodgers in addition to the 15 already living here, then one visit from the cleaner is not enough, we need to convert the whole house. That is something I have heard too little about, not only from you, but also from the other governments of the European Union. I know what you are thinking and perhaps what your intentions are: let us just begin with a few minor reforms at this Intergovernmental Conference and then, after next year’s Intergovernmental Conference, there will be another Intergovernmental Conference and so on and so forth. I put it to you that the people of the European Union are tired of seeing the EU stumble from one Intergovernmental Conference to the next, taking so many tiny steps that they no longer know which direction they are going in. We must show them once and for all what our image of the European Union and of the future of Europe is, instead of watching the EU constantly stumbling from one conference to the next. With regard to the common defence policy, we welcome the statement which you have made today, but there must be more to European summits than statements and papers. We want you to take the decisions needed in Helsinki so that concrete initiatives can be introduced into both military and non-military aspects of the common defence policy and to stipulate the operational capacities needed and the institutions in which the decisions are to be taken. Finally, we want, on the day after Helsinki, on 12 December, to be able to talk about a real European Summit, a Summit from which we can look out into the new millennium and not just a mole-hill without a view. You have the responsibility and the opportunity to ensure that the Finnish Presidency at the end of this century goes down in history as a great presidency! (Applause)

 Mr 
































































President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that Mr Poettering is keen to use the European Parliament as something of a platform for parading his national Opposition in Germany. But the performance you give here, Mr Poettering, cannot, nor will it ever match the real-life drama facing our Foreign Minister. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has passed the acid test during difficult times under your Presidency. You have quoted the important points here and I will not hesitate to say that in so doing a number of shortcomings and weaknesses have been glossed over. There is no doubt of that. But the decisions taken under the German Presidency over the last six months will shape the future of the European Union far into the next decade. Mr Poettering asked what would have happened if the decisions taken under the German Presidency had been taken under a Presidency of his political persuasion. I can tell you what would have happened, Mr Poettering. You would have rung all the bells here, lit a thousand candles and had the Te Deum strike up. Incidentally, that is the difference between Christian Democrats and European Democrats. We are not going to start singing here but would simply like to thank the German Presidency for a successful period in office. (Applause)  We welcome the fact that the European Council, under the German Presidency, has concluded the work on a European Employment Pact. We know that a European Employment Pact cannot replace national endeavours to create employment, but it can and must co-ordinate, focus and stimulate these endeavours. We also know that a European Employment Pact does not, at this stage, constitute European employment policy. The governments of all the Member States must succeed in progressing from non-binding joint declarations to binding common policy with clear guidelines and agreed terms of reference. We don"t just need a Pact to stabilise the euro but also one which will create employment in Europe. Secondly, the decisions the European Council had to take in the area of common foreign and security policy will alter the European Union more profoundly than it is possible to envisage at present. For the first time in history, the European Union employed armed troops in Europe on a joint basis, showing remarkable resolve in the process. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we want you to show the governments of the Member States the same determination when it comes to promoting peace in the Balkans. NATO won the war, the European Union must now win peace. The Stability Pact for the Balkans is a just and necessary step but it is not yet a Balkans policy. The creation of offices and agencies should not be the sum total of EU policy in the Balkans. If you continue in this vein then very soon you will need an office to co-ordinate the co-ordinators, and that is not a Balkans policy. My third point concerns the reform of the EU institutions. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in January, you made a fine speech here which was very forward-looking. However, the decisions taken by the Cologne European Council on institutional reform barely scratched the surface. We consider it too fainthearted to restrict ourselves to the reforms contained in the Amsterdam Protocol. It is certainly a good thing that you set the reform process in motion in Cologne, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have an answer to the questions you raised here regarding the future prospects for enlargement of the European Union and the shape of our European Union in institutional terms, and our answer to these questions is clear: we want major institutional reform to be undertaken prior to enlargement. The price of a larger Europe must not be a lesser Europe. Lastly, a few words on the new Commission. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke of the new Commission. May I remind you that there will only be a new Commission when the European Parliament inaugurates it by vote of confidence..... (Applause)  .... but if Mr Poettering is going to shout it about that the Chancellor did not speak to a Commissioner-designate before the nomination was made, then in fact I must inform you, Mr Poettering, that former Chancellor Kohl often spoke to Mr Bangemann and you can see how successful that proved to be, i.e. not at all. Talk serves no purpose whatsoever. Nevertheless, again on the address from the other side of the House as regards the inauguration of the new Commission, we refuse, and on this matter I now speak on behalf of the Group of the Social Democrats, to make the procedure and timetable of Parliament dependent on the presentation of a report by a non-parliamentary group or a non-parliamentary committee. We will not accept any delay in the inauguration of the Commission. You may well bring this about if you have the support of the majority, Mr Poettering, but then you will also have to explain to the public why a Commission that resigned in March is still in office six months after its resignation. My group will not support these obvious delaying tactics.

Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ‘gender budgeting’ must become more than a mere linguistic monstrosity. I ask and urge you to ensure that the principle of gender equality permeates this budget. Gender mainstreaming must be put into practice and must be made quantifiable in terms of euros. In the European Community, more women are victims of violence within the family than are victims of terrorism. For this reason, we call for 2006 to be declared the European Year against Violence. We want the Beijing +10 review to be used as a means of fleshing out the Beijing Platform for Action, and we want the results of the World Conference on Women to be implemented by a European Conference, for example, which would develop additional strategies. We also call for a European Gender Institute, which would compile reliable data as a basis for our political decisions. We expect the Commission to apply gender mainstreaming in all areas of political activity, and the 2005 budget, the first in the greater European Union, should provide us with the main indicators of its application.

 Thank you, Mr President, and congratulations to the Commissioner, who has conceived the educational programmes along very ambitious lines. I hope that we, working together with the Commission, will be able to budget for them. I would remind you that Erasmus aimed to include 10% of students in the programme. Let us hope that we succeed in doing that. Let me now turn to the new programme. Our agenda simply describes this as a debate on the education and cultural programmes. My fear is that young people will end up footing the bill if their concerns are thrown into a single package along with everything else. We, I think, must ensure – and you, in your proposal, must specify – that the youth programmes must be properly funded, that the informal system of education will continue to be valued as it needs to be in the future, and will be able to be extended in order to prepare people for active citizenship. If all these things – youth, culture, audiovisuals, media, and films – end up in a single package, my fear is that young people will end up paying the bill and losing out. That must not be allowed to happen.

 Mr President, your establishment of the high-level working group is a good sign that, by implementing gender mainstreaming, you are demonstrating what this House wants. Rather than gender mainstreaming and the gender dimension to our policies being left to women alone, the gentlemen in this House must allow themselves to be judged by the degree to which they are willing to join in taking policy decisions that make equality and women’s democratic rights real. In the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, it is a cause of grave concern to us that the proportion of women in the next Parliament will be lower, and so every effort must be made to underline the political will from the top downwards. I can only urge all the committees to adopt projects in their own areas of responsibility – in accordance with the resolution in our report, a year ago, on gender mainstreaming – and to make it clear that mainstreaming gender equality is not just to be left to the Committee on Women’s Rights. (Applause)
Gröner (PSE

rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it augurs well that we are holding this debate on International Women’s Day, and thereby bringing our commitment to such things as the combating of violence to the attention of the countries from which we come. Mrs Karamanou has alluded to the many things we have achieved since Finland, a century ago, became the first country in Europe to give women the vote; the results have been many, they alone count, and not one of them just happened; women always had to fight hard for them. Speaking as the rapporteur on the Daphne programme, I would describe the situation facing us today as the tip of an iceberg; I refer to the trial of Marc Dutroux, a case that we can expect to disclose a veritable morass of violence against women and children. One might say that we can see the initiative that led to the Daphne programme ten years ago, at a time when Dutroux’ crimes came to light, now forming a direct link with the programme’s second stage, aimed at preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women. This second stage, running from 2004 to 2008, is accompanied by a substantial increase in resources, and I have to remind you that we now have EUR 10 million per annum as against EUR 5 million per annum in the first stage. Although this is still a mere drop in the ocean, doubling the annual budget in this way is urgently necessary, as Daphne I was able to fund only 13% of the good projects. Much of the knowledge gained from the first stage of Daphne was incorporated into the new programme. We had a long battle with the Commission and the Council to get a helpdesk set up for NGO’s seeking help from the programme for the first time, especially those in the new Member States, where the structures of NGOs for women are still very weak. What is now Amendment No 5 is a form of words to which the Council can agree, and I hope that we will soon have an agreement on this. The draft report also includes a proposal to declare 2006 the European Year Against Violence, to inaugurate a wide-ranging public debate aimed at developing further initiatives to halt the advance of the deadly virus of violence. I am able to mention only a few of them: there has been a dramatic increase in trafficking in women, and, according to the International Organisation for Migration, 500 000 women have been smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited and forced into prostitution. That figure has now risen to 800 000, and the well-organised criminal slave trading rings – for that is what I call them – do not shrink from trafficking in children as well. One of our amendments deflected a Council proposal to the effect that the Daphne II programme should concentrate more on offenders. We did not see why resources that were in any case meagre should be taken away from the victims, and offenders identified as a target group. More to the point, the preventive measures under Daphne I already facilitate work with offenders and victims and bring the two together. Informal dialogue between the Council, the Commission and my committee made it possible for us to agree on proposals, which we put to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities as amendments. If we were to find a broad majority to support these amendments tomorrow, it would send a clear message to women – and not only to women, but also to organisations in Europe, that we are joining battle against violence, and that we will not stand idly by while gangs of criminals make billions. My thanks go to the Commission, above all to Commissioner Vitorino, and to the Irish and Italian presidencies of the Council for their cooperation; I hope that we can expect broad support for these five amendments tomorrow, and that the Common Position, as thus amended, can then enter into force without delay, for the programme for the necessary task of combating violence is urgently needed. (Applause)
Gröner (PSE

rapporteur. – (DE)
 Mr President, we have indeed got through the agenda rather faster than usual, but youth has, I think, caught up with us. Our future lies in young people and one can see how much a society values them by how many possibilities it offers them and how closely it involves them in plans for the future. A dynamic society must offer its new generation prospects and security, both in terms of material things and social acceptance and in terms of a sense of cohesion. I am glad to see that the Commissioner, too, took a different estimate of the time. The White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth saw the light of day in November 2001 after much consultation with all concerned and two long years in which to mature; we do now need to think about how we can keep it alive. I think that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are all on the right path here. We need to integrate the 75 million young people between 15 and 25 in a European Union that will soon include 25 Member States, by bringing young people and youth organisations into the political arena. As rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and through my work in connection with this White Paper, I have followed the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of years and listened closely to what young Europeans have had to tell us. My conclusion is that young people want to be taken seriously, and we should not disappoint them by failing to do this. We have succeeded in boosting youth policy among young people, youth organisations, non-governmental organisations, political representatives in the EU and the Member States. If we see the White Paper as being about open coordination and mainstreaming, then the Commission’s communication on the follow-up is more about participation and information. Young people must be integrated more, and at an earlier stage, so that they can participate in representative democracy at the regional, national and European level. We particularly need to show our interest in integrating young people now as we approach the European elections, but unfortunately we are discussing this important matter at a late hour in a House that is almost empty. Young people communicate on the Internet and the Commission has therefore opened a youth portal but this falls far short of what is needed, which is information that is local and has been specifically developed for them. They need to experience equal opportunities and non-discrimination, for example in youth councils made up of equal numbers of young men and young women. Where no such councils exist, we need to set them up. Formal and informal education have to be networked with youth work to a greater degree. Youth programmes are already allowing hundreds of thousands of young people to meet and these, together with the thousands of voluntary work projects, lead towards social skills and a European outlook. If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economic area in the world, we must make every effort to ensure that no young people are excluded. Those who are considered to be disadvantaged – female immigrants, girls, and young men – and on the fringes of the European Union and of society, are the ones whom we most need to integrate. Regional cooperation, culture and sport all serve as a bridge to help overcome prejudices and solve the problems of tomorrow. In November 2003, the Council stipulated some common objectives. The first evaluation of the new action lines’ implementation will be carried out at the end of 2005 and the Commission will then draw up a progress report on the basis of the reports submitted by Member States. The first European Youth Week took place last year and was widely supported. Under the motto ‘overcoming exclusion’ we are now starting to work on the ‘Youth’ action programme and in other new areas and are trying to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient financial resources both to meet the growing demands of globalisation and to create spaces in which young people can concern themselves with future European policy. With the broad synergy that we have achieved between the Commission, Parliament, the political groups and even Member States, we should succeed not only in speaking to young people but also in integrating them. It is our goal to keep the momentum going, to support young people and strengthen youth policy in Europe.

 I am convinced that the Members’ Statute, demanded so vehemently by this House, is yet another indication of the failure of the Italian Presidency of the Council. The chosen solution to the issue of the taxation of MEPs’ salaries is botched and temporary, but, above all, there are no rules on the legal status of MEPs. Under no circumstances can I vote in its favour while the issue of immunity remains unresolved, nor can I accept the curtailment of rights that guarantee the exercise of an independent mandate, such as are accorded to our counterparts in the national and regional parliaments. I therefore no longer have any confidence in the Council’s will, at the present time, to bring about a single statute for MEPs, and, for that reason, I vote against the resolution RC B5-543-/2003.

 Mr President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the subject of the programme intended to support women’s organisations and has replaced the Budget line that formerly funded only the European women’s lobby – that being the umbrella organisation for some 3 000 women’s organisations in Europe, including the national women’s councils, such as the Deutscher Frauenrat
, which has about 11 million individual members in Germany, ranging from church groups to autonomous bodies via political women’s associations and trade unions. The European women’s lobby has initiated important campaigns, such as the campaign for increased involvement by women in the European elections, has prompted a debate on the constitution, and is monitoring enlargement with a particular eye on equal opportunities issues. What the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats now wants is for this line to be dismantled. We want to ensure quality. We want to speak for women with one voice rather than join in a chorus of many. In contrast to the rapporteur, my group wants, from the very outset, to make this a priority and ensure action in the European interest in the equal opportunities field. We will therefore reject most of the rapporteur’s amendments in favour of those put forward by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. We Social Democrats contend that Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has also presented a well-thought out proposal for funding, fully in line with the Budget Regulation, which secures provision of funding up to and including 2008, to the tune of EUR 5.5 million. That gives women’s organisations the security they need to plan ahead, and spares us another laborious legislative process once the two years are up. The cofinancing arrangement, with 20% for women’s organisations, with the exception of the European Women’s Lobby, which gets 10%, excluding degressivity, is a solution with which all parties can live. When enlargement happens, we want the organisations from Central and Eastern Europe also to be included, and we want priorities set. It is therefore proposed in Amendment 13 – in which there is a translation mistake that I will bring to the services’ attention – that work and family life be made more compatible. We want to encourage women to play their part in the decision-making process; we want this programme, and the organisations, to support the fight against all forms of violence. We also want to support the fight against gender-specific stereotyping and discrimination of all kinds, especially in the workplace and in relation to pay, and we also welcome the encouragement given to women’s cooperation in third countries, for example in Amendment 14. At the very last minute, the Italian presidency of the Council has attempted to bring influence to bear on us to get us to go along with the rapporteur’s proposals. Both my group and I are hoping for a majority in this House, we are not willing to encourage the fragmentation of women’s voices. We want unity rather than polyphony.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is not merely a project for the ruling classes, but will also, if it succeeds, be an enormous triumph for democracy. The EU will soon have 450 million citizens, and over half of them are women. If women are to take their share in building Europe, information must be targeted at them and they must be involved in specific ways. This parliamentary term has seen us developing our strategy for gender mainstreaming and finding room for it in the Budget process, but its successes are not as evident as they could be, in that women are still generally not visible in the policy areas and we still generally do not see them occupying positions of leadership in the institutions. Women make up only 14% of the observers from the candidate countries, only 17% of the members of the Convention, and only 25% of the Commissioners. Whilst women make up 70% of the staff in category C, not one of Parliament’s Directors-General is a woman. Our resolution on gender mainstreaming proposes a whole range of actions to set benchmarks for the horizontal task of deliberately bringing women into the institutions, such as monitoring the success of leave for educational purposes, retraining, career and personal development, and so on. Commissioner, you are now encouraging high expectations of gender budgeting, the implementation of which will mean the professional ‘gendering’ of every committee, every policy area, and every one of the Directorates-General. We need to identify women as a target group when thinking in terms of the visibility of information campaigns, particularly in elections, and that we should involve women in every area of foreign policy – for example, in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq. DAPHNE was a good challenge, and so, of course, are the internal policy areas such as the Structural Funds, for example.

 Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, the DAPHNE Programme – as we will all well recall – was brought into being in response to the results of the Peking Platform for Action, in the aftermath of the Stockholm world congress on the sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes and, finally, following the horrors of the Dutroux affair, which gave the European public a rude awakening. The initiative was aimed at funding measures to combat violence against children, young people, and women in Europe, and its great success led to the DAPHNE I Programme, which will now keep on running right up to 2003. A four-year programme, it was funded to the tune of EUR 20 million. My report is concerned with the Commission’s proposal for the DAPHNE II Programme, which is to run from 2004 to 2008. Within the programme’s framework, measures can now be promoted to protect the three groups that will benefit – children, young people, and women – as can the relevant preventive measures. These include the establishment of networks for NGOs across Europe, support for collaboration between NGOs and authorities in the same field, measures to protect the target groups and to prevent violence against those belonging to them, studies, research work aimed at discovering the causes of violence, at preventing it, and at the support of groups at risk and their reintegration into society. This includes the sharing of good practice and of information, as well as awareness programmes for the general public, for the victims, the groups at risk and for those who work with them. Participation in the DAPHNE I Programme was open to the central and eastern European countries, as well as to Cyprus, Malta, Turkey and the countries belonging to EFTA and the European Economic Area, and there was the possibility of multiannual programmes. Amendment No 11 is now aimed at linking DAPHNE with other Community programmes and sharing the experience of them with third states. The DAPHNE Programme, which supports these projects, is now regarded, both in Europe and far beyond its borders, as exemplary and as an important instrument in combating violence. What we have achieved is a change to framework conditions through regional initiatives with international concepts. The German Protection against Violence Act, for example, has taken on distinct characteristics derived from European experience. Let me also, at this point, mention the Austrian right of exclusion in cases of domestic violence, which keeps perpetrators of violence away from the home. DAPHNE I’s budget made it possible to fund 140 projects. The thirty-five projects selected in 2001 focussed on the genital mutilation of women, in which third countries were also involved, and the sexual exploitation of children through paedophilia. It must be made clear, though, that these projects saw the submission of 662 proposals in the last two years, and that these would in fact have necessitated funding to the tune of EUR 65 million. The glut of applications, and the fact that only 13% of all projects in respect of which applications were submitted could be funded, makes it apparent that significantly greater sums need to be made available. We cannot fail to come to the conclusion that funding for DAPHNE II must be increased to EUR 65 million, and my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, has supported an amendment to this effect. If the praise heaped on DAPHNE I is not to be forgotten – and it is not a matter of controversy to say that it should not be – then this must be made a political priority. The response from the Committee on Women’s Rights has been somewhat timid. In contrast to what my group has proposed, we have come up with the figure of EUR 50 million, so I have submitted the new amendment and ask you to support it. Amendment No 39 is intended to set up a helpdesk providing help to women’s organisations in the new Member States, which have as yet little experience of European programmes. We want the European Year against Violence to be based on our experience with DAPHNE and to make a definite mark. This European Year against Violence could become a reality as soon as 2006. I am aware that the idea of a substantial topping-up of funds is meeting with resistance from the Committee on Budgets, but if DAPHNE, which is founded upon the health articles in the Treaties, is not to go unheeded and be dismissed as a game like football – the example given by the Commissioner – for lack of a legal basis specific to it, and if we want to take seriously the problems involved in combating violence, then we must demonstrate political courage and make more funding available.

 Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on the fact that there are not just 20 Members present to debate this report, but that for once we are at last considering equalities issues with a full House. (Applause)
 Gender 
budgeting is a relatively recent idea, which was developed at the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. In the context of gender mainstreaming, it involves analysing public budgets to assess their differing impacts on men and women, and to raise awareness among political and economic actors – which we have ample opportunity to do today. Discrimination very soon becomes apparent when figures talk and we see that only 6% of the Structural Funds are geared towards helping women. Let me give you another example from the EU Budget: the forest protection programme has a budget of EUR 52 million, whereas the programme for the protection of children, young people and women is allocated only EUR 41 million, a clear 20% less. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities hopes, by means of this report, to stimulate a debate that will expose the inequality and discrimination in the Budget. But we need instruments to achieve that, and this point is addressed to you personally, Commissioner Solbes Mira: please work within the Commission to ensure that we finally get the directive under Article 13, which relates to discrimination on grounds of gender, which will at last give us a significant instrument. (Applause)

 Mr President, I am speaking not as a woman, but as my group’s representative. You too, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, spoke as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Women make up some 40% of the fifteen million people who work in agriculture in the EU, and run one in every five farms – around 1.3 million – which, apart from a mere 3% larger ones, are small and medium-sized operations. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report gives more detailed information on this. Although, of all the Community’s policies, the CAP is far and away the most highly developed, there is still a positively criminal neglect of gender mainstreaming. The consequence of this is that there is scarcely any visible sign of women in rural areas enjoying equal status and equal rights. Although a number of instruments have been devised, any visible breakthrough in the CAP is still a long way in the future. Even though, in my view, the reform of agricultural policy left the fields strewn with dead lobbyists, it does have a very apparent shortcoming in that women have not managed to get the systematic promotion of women in agriculture accepted. Especially painful though that is, it is primarily in the restructuring of rural areas in the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe that even greater pain will be felt. What is on our minds is the new working arrangements that have to be devised. We are thinking about facilities that improve the balance between working life and family life, as well as about childcare facilities, and the provision of care for disabled and older people. We are thinking about the need to further develop rural tourism, and about how to promote alternative energies, and regional marketing cycles. These may be only ad hoc 
approaches, but they have added to the range of culture on offer. Women have eventually found a small niche in all this and seized an opportunity, but I think of the state of Bavaria, from which I come and which the President knows well – there, in 2002, EUR 17 million from the rural development programme were not allocated, which – if we add in the co-financed sums that could have been used for specific projects, including for women – means that a total of EUR 34 million could not be paid out. As regards many of the available resources, we still have to exert pressure on the Member States, and so I ask the Commission, when monitoring the programmes’ operation, to pay much closer attention to the way in which gender mainstreaming is actually implemented, so that it does not remain merely a topic for pious utterances. My group has endorsed Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report. We have tabled amendments in the hope of extending it to cover the fisheries sector, in which a very large number of women work. I speak also on behalf of the rapporteur when I ask the House to support us in seeking this, and I appeal to the Commission to include this dimension. (Applause)

Mr President, before my speaking time starts, I would just like to clarify that Mrs Stihler spoke as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and would like to thank the House for the support given to Mrs Jöns’s report. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities calls in the report for the fight against breast cancer to become a health policy priority for the EU. High-quality screening, diagnosis, treatment and aftercare for breast cancer must form an integrated whole and be provided in Member States. With the Commission’s support, this can be done by 2008 in accordance with our proposal. In Europe, a woman dies of breast cancer every 20 minutes. In Germany, every year 46 000 women suffer from this disease and 19 000 die from it. Breast cancer affects women at the height of their professional and family responsibilities. In women between the ages of 35 and 55, breast cancer is still the most common cause of death. On behalf of my group, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns. Her work has a very positive influence, not only because of her own victory over breast cancer, but also because she is fighting for all women in the European Union to receive the best possible treatment. Our aims are high-quality national screening and the establishment of breast centres. The relevant guidelines have already been developed by the European Society for Mastology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Europa Donna. Now it is a question of transposing them quickly. The multidisciplinary breast centres shall bring together radiologists, oncologists, pathologists, psychologists and surgeons, who will consult with the patient on the best method of treatment for her. In Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands a nation-wide screening programme has led to a 30% reduction in the mortality rate. We have now been allocated EUR 400 million in the sixth framework programme of research. At the earliest possible opportunity, national cancer registers should be set up so that we may finally have informative data about the possible influence of risk factors like tobacco, diet, life-style and environment on the development of cancer. This is particularly important with regard to breast cancer. We do of course clash with other interest groups. In my native state of Bavaria, for example, we are taking a different path because X-raying is going to be left to general practitioners. It is only in accordance with the EU guidelines, however, that optimal treatment can be attained. Only when the attending physician reads at least 5 000 mammograph screenings per year does he acquire enough training and experience to recognise breast cancer when it is between five and seven millimetres. Those who do not support this are concerned only with the interests of their professional groups and not with our goal of saving thousands of women’s lives. Every seventh or eighth woman will be affected. We can count through each row here and see how many of us that will be.

 Today's vote on the accession of ten Central and Eastern European states sees us laying the foundation on which the historical division of Europe into East and West will be overcome. The historical division into masculine and feminine worlds persists, however, both in Eastern and in Western Europe. My ‘yes’ to the accession of Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is coupled with the expectation that the acquis communautaire
 will be adopted without reservation, and given life, as it applies to the area of equal opportunities for women and men. I will not deny that I found it very difficult to say ‘yes’ to the accession of the Republic of Poland, which, along with the United Kingdom, is a participant in war against Iraq, a war of aggression and contrary to international law. I therefore see it as my responsibility as a German social democrat to set today's European date of 9 April 2003 against the nationalist date of 1 September 1939, at the same time hoping for peace and prosperity for all and for a European social model based on partnership.

 Mr President, we are still eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Commissioner, who has indicated that she would be present for this item. I hope that she will be appearing any moment now. In my own-initiative report on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I have dealt with gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament both at political and administrative level. We have held discussions on this in my committee with stakeholders, we have had a series of discussions both with the President and with the Secretary-General, followed by a public hearing, and we have also held discussions with staff representatives and with the advisory committee. The European Union's obligation to promote equality between men and women is rooted in Articles 2, 3 and 13 of the EC Treaty and in Article 23 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. Gender mainstreaming as a political strategy is intended to assist in achieving this ambitious objective. This also follows on from the definition of the Beijing Platform for Action, under which gender mainstreaming is intended to further the development, organisation and evaluation of political measures and decision-making processes so that the initial position and the impact on men and women is taken into consideration in all areas of policy and at all levels, with a view to working towards the objective of genuine equality for men and women. Parliament must act as a motor for equal opportunities, as it has indeed repeatedly done in the past, and gender mainstreaming now needs to be incorporated into our political activities and our structures in a coherent and comprehensive way. This report accordingly proposes a whole raft of measures intended to underpin the principle of gender mainstreaming in the long term. Strengthening the position of women is therefore a key aspect, but not the only one, the aim being to adopt a double approach. We propose a number of measures in the report. The European Union needs to lead the way, and Parliament should signal its active commitment by setting up a High-Level Group on Gender Equality, chaired by its President, just as happened at the Commission under President Santer. We are definitely lagging somewhat behind. The Conference of Committee Chairs needs to be involved here and, in conjunction with the Committee of Delegation Chairs, it should make recommendations to the Conference of Presidents as to how to implement gender mainstreaming in the committees' and delegations' work in a concrete way. Our proposal here is that one member, preferably the Chair or a Vice-Chair, should be made responsible for gender mainstreaming and that the individual committees should then identify projects in their respective work programmes to ascertain how gender mainstreaming can be achieved in their area of activity and systematically check the impact of measures affecting women and men. With this in mind, planning and implementation, and also evaluation, need to be oriented towards achieving a defined quality standard and facilitating internal benchmarking. Each committee should then carry out an annual assessment of its activities and achievements in the field of gender mainstreaming on the basis of predetermined targets and should monitor these measures. We propose that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should then draw the individual reports together into an annual report on gender mainstreaming and make recommendations for further steps. A further package of measures concerning agreement on how to reconcile staff members' professional and family activities is then needed. One important target is the use of gender-neutral language. Our objective, particularly bearing in mind enlargement, must be to involve the candidate countries in this process, and with an eye to the elections to Parliament in 2004 to ensure that equal representation of men and women can be achieved. The situation as it stands is that although Parliament has always been in the vanguard in this respect, the proportion of women Members was 17.5% in 1979, and this has now risen to 31%. However, in the Convention, there has been a step backwards. I believe that it is highly important that we should give a positive political signal by implementing benchmarking and gender mainstreaming, so that the 2004 elections will represent an advance – and not a retrograde step.

Mr President, although it was a year ago that Afghanistan's Taliban regime was toppled, there has been scarcely any improvement in the appalling position of women there. That became convincingly apparent to the first five-man delegation from this House, instigated by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who recently visited Afghanistan – not only Kabul, but also up-country. The health care system is a disaster, and an Afghan woman dies, either as a result of pregnancy or in childbirth, every 20 minutes. That is the highest rate recorded worldwide. The education system had collapsed utterly. Today, girls' schools are again vulnerable to attacks by fundamentalists. Most Afghan women are barred from taking up employment, and they have little or no share in political power or in the work of reconstruction. We had discussions with President Karzai and with many members of his cabinet, and appealed to them in unambiguous terms for the Petersberg resolutions to be implemented only with women participating in the proper way. The European Union is helping in so far as it is able. I want to reiterate that the Commission is doing excellent work on the ground, in that – as Commissioner Patten has said – its officials on the ground are playing a very substantial part in nation-building, and doing so with the greatest personal dedication, for which they deserve our especial thanks. Let us take a look into the future. I urge Parliament's Bureau to invite both President Karzai and the chair of the independent human rights commission, Dr. Sima 
Samar, to Parliament with the prime purpose of our discussing with them the preparations for the elections and for the Loja Jirga that is to produce a constitution. The clear message to a democratic Afghanistan must be that this constitution must, without reservations, give women's rights a solid base. It is difficult to get back to normality in a country in which, according to one American study, 70% of all Afghan women suffer from severe depression and 65% keep contemplating suicide. The subject of sexual violence is shrouded in strict social taboos. We heard complaints from women's organisations to the effect that their work, even in the international organisations, was made extremely difficult by restrictions on women's mobility, including their being prohibited from driving cars or even riding bicycles. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has taken up this issue on many occasions. We had discussions with the Minister for Women, Mrs Sobrani – the deputy minister, as it happens – and she complained that she received no financial resources for her department. The lack of coordination leads to friction costs in the work of the NGOs and government offices. This is somewhere else where we must help. It is unfortunate that there is still no banking system in Afghanistan, and this is another factor that continues to encourage corruption. It does, however, give me great satisfaction to learn that there is strong consensus here in this House, within the presidency and the Commission, that the position of women needs to be improved. Let us, then, set about improving the position of women, hoping for peace and stability in the region! And the message to our American friends must be: no war in the Middle East!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have an almost balanced representation of Members here today for this debate on women's rights. On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the Commission and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for their reports. The Commission has succeeded particularly well in giving clear pointers for the way forward in equal opportunities, by means of the framework strategy on gender mainstreaming and the associated fifth action programme on gender equality. More rapid progress is being made in some areas. Last year, we adopted the directive on equal treatment in employment. That is a milestone, and we keenly await the first evaluation report. In other areas, things are taking a little longer. However, there are already clear pointers in the case of the Structural Funds and as regards combating violence. I would like to point out that we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have already on several occasions proposed what was agreed here this morning: to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport. This House and I myself have for many years been calling for a European year of action against violence. I hope that will be picked up again. We are also very anxious to see the proposal for a directive under Article 13 banning discrimination. There is also some delay on that. This needs to be pursued with great vigour. We also need to maintain the political will to make progress in involving women at all levels of decision making, both legally speaking and in practice. The outcome of the Convention in that respect has been very disappointing, so we need to act now. There is also still a great deal to be done in the European Parliament, and my criticisms are accordingly also aimed at this House. Let us not beat about the bush – Parliament is lagging somewhat behind the Commission when it comes to implementing gender mainstreaming internally. We need to make progress both in terms of political decision-making and as regards the administration. Balanced participation of women and men can only be achieved if a genuine political will exists, and it requires a top-down approach. We are particularly looking to the political group chairs, to the President of Parliament and to the committee chairs to set a clear example. We are at present working in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on an initiative to achieve gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament, a kind of gender equality health programme if you like. It will be ready in time for the 2003 International Women's Day. I believe that we can set an example here to make it crystal clear that the European Parliament – even when enlargement is in the offing – is serious about equal opportunities for women and men. Particularly when elections are on the horizon, it is not enough for the parties just to include equal opportunities in their manifestos; we also have to make sure it is implemented in practice. We expect that here in the European Parliament, where 30% of the Members are women, which means that we are somewhat better than average, things will be even better after the elections, so that we will move significantly closer to the goal of equal representation of men and women in this House. There are many other points appearing in both reports that I could comment on. I believe that ultimately the crucial factor will be the political will that needs to be demonstrated if the position of women is really to be improved.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the different effects of our budget decisions on women and men have scarcely featured in our debate today. For years, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has put forward proposals during the budget procedure to take account of the different impacts of our decisions on women and men. We have been successful in the field of employment policy and the Structural Funds, where gender mainstreaming is now enshrined as a principle. In foreign policy, too, gender sensitivity is increasing. In the context of aid to Afghanistan, targeted measures have thus been introduced to reintegrate women into public life and restore their human rights. We have achieved successes in combating trafficking in human beings, which is a modern form of slavery. Violence against women has also become an issue in the budget. Nonetheless, the STOP and DAPHNE programmes must not be used simply to carry out representative events. Ultimately, just 13% of the projects can be funded, which is why the NGOs must be given direct assistance. Gender budgeting must become even more of a theme than is currently the case. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is working on an own-initiative report on this issue. A word of criticism on the practice governing the allocation of funds as well: all too often – for example, in town twinning or the NGOs – it generates a great deal of resentment. There is much frustration among active Europeans. If on the one hand, we ensure that we do not spend any more on tobacco cultivation and we dismantle bureaucratic hurdles in this area, we cannot then put up similar hurdles in the way of the NGOs. I ask for your support. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating an area of lifelong learning means taking active steps to guarantee equality of opportunity for all population groups. The European Union cannot realistically achieve that alone, considering that 1% of the total budget is invested in culture and education. Something would need to change there too. What is more, there is often a narrow-minded anxiety in the Member States, in Germany's Länder
 for example, as regards cultural sovereignty. They feel that their cultural sovereignty is being threatened when the EU makes pronouncements about education policy. The results of the Pisa Study should have opened people's eyes. Finland has achieved excellent results in practising lifelong learning, beating Germany with its achievement principle in the first phase of education, which often blocks people's path to further education. So we can learn from each other. We should draw up training plans for new developments relating to the electronic revolution, in industry as well. We should extend education centres. The rapporteur has proposed individual learning accounts. The key issues here are exchanges of information and experience. We need to have recognised, guaranteed systems for mutual recognition of final examinations. That needs to be developed. We need to gear what is on offer towards specific groups, for example mothers returning to work, for single parents who need childcare arrangements, for migrant workers, and for people in rural areas. The Commission and the Member States should focus on this in a coordinated way, and particularly careful attention needs to be paid to the gender mainstreaming approach for lifelong learning. We also need to take advantage of all possible instruments, such as loans from the EIB, in order to extend our educational systems so as to create a modern and efficient educational system. We need to involve the informal sector and accelerate the political process of adult education, we need a new learning culture to secure sustainable development of the most precious resource at our disposal – people and their minds.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union played a very active part in the democratisation of Afghanistan, for which particular thanks are due to the Commission and most especially its staff on the ground. It was as early as the International Women's Day in 1998 that European women started the ‘Flower for the Women of Kabul’ campaign, and deplored the human rights violations that excluded women in particular from education, medical treatment, work and political involvement. Another six years of the Taliban's despotic rule had gone by before things began to look up for democracy. The international anti-terror alliance then laid the spectre of the Taliban to rest. Democracy movements were launched at once, and the EU again played an active part in this on the Petersberg in Bonn. At the same time, albeit attracting almost no attention, the first Afghan Women's Summit was meeting in Brussels at the invitation of European women. It was there, for the first time and after two decades without political involvement, that it was possible for Afghan women, whether living in exile or in Afghanistan itself, to have their own forum and find themselves. International pressure made it possible for women to be first admitted to the Loya Jirga
 and subsequently to participate in the new transitional government. In the meantime, we saw to it that the Budget included funds to help the women make up a great deal of lost ground, and that it was again possible for self-help organisations such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) to receive support from Budget funds. It is with consternation that we now hear it reported that the first schools for girls are being closed down again, that fundamentalists again want to force women out of public life, and that the political influence of women ministers is being curbed. All the political influence at our disposal must now be brought to bear in order to prevent the situation of women worsening still further and above all to ensure that aid reaches rural areas and is passed on to women. Jointly with the women on the European Council, we had taken the initiative of setting up a multinational group of women observers to ensure that women get the aid they need. Believing as I do that this fire must be kept alight, I now urgently call upon the Commission to continue to focus on the situation of women, and urge that we combat the principal evil, which is poverty and illiteracy among women. Even if world public opinion concentrates on other issues, I do think that we should continue to focus on Afghanistan and that we have to maintain a local presence there. My group, the Group of Social Democrats, will be sending a delegation to Afghanistan, and I look to the Commission to provide support for it in the shape of logistical aid. The threat of war in Iraq would destroy much that has been achieved, and so all our efforts are needed to help make peace in the region. (Applause)

Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the Commission's mid-term review of the Daphne programme. This programme has proven to be highly effective in combating violence against children, young people and women, even though it has had very little funding. Daphne was born of an initiative by Commissioner Anita Gradin and the European Parliament and it is a perfect example of how, with huge personal commitment on the part of everyone involved in the programme and in implementing the project and clear political will, results can be achieved and new policies developed. Because violence is such a massive phenomenon, it has been hard to narrow the Daphne programme down. This is a taboo subject in the twilight zone. There is a lack of unequivocal data. But we know from studies that every third woman has experience of some form of gender-related violence. One in five women suffers violence at the hands of their spouse or partner. According to IOM estimates, 500 000 people are caught up in trafficking in the European Union every year, mainly women and children, while other women are at risk of genital mutilation. We were only able to support 73 projects under Daphne in 2000 and 2001, just 12% of the projects proposed, causing some frustration among NGOs. Four million euros a year – hardly enough to move mountains – but enough to raise expectations and then dash them. But what is important is that Daphne was a multi-disciplinary tool and the Commission should continue to demonstrate flexibility here. For example, the violence monitoring centre in Dublin overseen by the European women's lobby provides excellent data. It also has managed to draft a good overview of the measures introduced and the legal instruments in the Member States. It brings synergies between players and projects at national, European and international level together. Unfortunately, the central and eastern European countries are still not involved enough. Only 6% of organisations even have any resources to put into projects. We found out during our delegations' trips to the candidate countries that there is a tremendous need here; they are hugely willing but financially unable and these two factors need to be reconciled in the NGOs. It is important not to stop at the external borders of the European Union. Russia, the Ukraine, Belorussia, nowhere is safe from this phenomenon, which also affects us here in the European Union. We need to open up more and include other Community programmes in the Daphne programme. I and my group think it is important that we build on our experience from the first half of the programme to strengthen synergies in the second half of Daphne. This is stated in item 12 of the resolution. We must continue with the campaign against violence and with preventive measures. There are excellent examples of this on the external borders in the form of warnings to young women. We have achieved good results with our networks, with the NGOs, and these now need to be implemented in the Member States. What we really need – and this has been pointed out and called for on several occasions – is a European Year against Violence. Commissioner Reding, who is responsible for communications, has already given the go-ahead. Now we must push in the Convention for a clear statement to the effect that, from the point of view of the legal basis, this is not just a public health issue; internal security is also at risk if violence against women continues.

Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Anne van Lancker, who has made a huge effort to bring about a consensus here in the House. As previous speakers have said, this is a very delicate subject which touches on the most intimate area of our citizens' lives. So exactly what is this report about? It is about the right that, at the end of the day, no one here in this House would wish to be deprived of. It is about the right of control over ones own body. Women cannot be denied this right, the less privileged in the European Union cannot be denied this right, the citizens who are to join the European Union cannot be denied this right. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has, without any shadow of a doubt, recognised the primary competence of the Member States in safeguarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. But Europe also has a huge responsibility as pioneers in the world, as we conveyed at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, when we defended the concept of the need to safeguard sexual health and reproductive rights. Mrs van Lancker has abided very closely by these specifications and has presented a whole host of best practices in her report, the most important being proper education on responsible sexual conduct, on which we need careful guidance by experts, with the Member States providing full coverage by professional advice centres. A gender-specific approach aimed at young people is needed and mutual respect and responsibility must be shown on sexual matters. The Member States must ensure that girls who become pregnant are not excluded from education which, unfortunately, is what usually happens. There are pointers on this in the White Paper on Youth. We must offer a networked policy here, which is why the European Parliament and the Commission also have work to do. We must take a closer look at the situation in the candidate countries, where little contraception is available at affordable prices and abortion is often used as a method of family planning. As the van Lancker report clearly states, we must prevent this. Abortion can never be the solution; we must prevent unwanted pregnancies per se. The sub-text is probably that it stops women from becoming independent and I am quite appalled at this campaign, which was attacked once again here in Parliament: with half truths, by questionable means, millions of women are being disconcerted by the assertion that terminating a pregnancy increases the risk of breast cancer. Half truths are being used to make millions of women insecure and deprive them of their rights. We will not stand for this any longer, which is why I hope that there will be a large majority in favour of Mrs Van Lancker's report tomorrow. (Applause)

 Mr President, the conciliation procedure on the Equal Treatment Directive has produced a respectable result, for which heartfelt thanks are due to our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala. I am convinced that this amended directive will prove to be a milestone in the improvement of women's career opportunities. It was quite literally at the last minute that we managed to come to a compromise on the definition of the concept of sexual harassment in the workplace, one which prohibits any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature violating the dignity of the person affected. For the first time direct and indirect discrimination come within the scope of an EU law, with binding effect in fifteen Member States and soon in ten more. It also constitutes a breakthrough of massive dimensions that women may not suffer any disadvantage in employment in connection with pregnancy or motherhood, and that they are accorded the right to their former job or an equivalent post after maternity leave. It has taken a tenacious struggle to give paternal leave to fathers and the protection of the directive to adoptive parents as well. The Member States and the candidate countries now have until 2005 to see to it that businesses are required to set up independent units to draw up equal treatment plans, also to take preventive action and equip themselves with the resources they need to do this. Real sanctions are to be imposed for non-compliance. It is an open question whether the arrangement in Germany, with a voluntary joint commitment by the federal government and the employers' associations which goes in this direction, will meet the high standards of our EU directive. If businesses do not noticeably redouble their efforts to promote women, it is inevitable that the way ahead will be via a referral to the European Court of Justice.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to thank all those who have contributed to this White Paper giving European youth policy a new impetus, and in the production of which a unique consultation process has involved thousands of young Europeans. Parliament, too, has made its own important contribution in a public hearing which attracted a great deal of attention. Whilst emphasising that the main responsibility for young people lies with the Member States, we support the proposed new forms of cooperation (a) by means of open coordination, which, though, in our view needs to be given tangible form by an interinstitutional agreement, and (b) in the form of mainstreaming, that is to say, the taking into account of young people's interests in other policy areas. Anyone, though, who listened attentively to the young people, heard them speak not only about such issues as education, lifelong learning, mobility, employment, social integration, anti-racism and the combating of xenophobia, but also about other important issues such as equality of opportunity for young women and young men, immigration, addiction to alcohol and other drugs as being important areas calling for action in Europe. Our committee expects of the Convention that it will come up with proposals as to how young people can be actively involved in the construction of a democratic Europe, as Europe still seems to them to be a long way away. I, as rapporteur, believe it to be necessary to expand the chapter on young people in the Treaty on European Union and to further raise the profile of children and youth policy in the Commission as well, especially in view of the outcome of the World Summit for Children in New York. European youth organisations, especially the European Youth Forum, made a substantial contribution to the gestation of the White Paper, in which we now call on all actors, ranging from researchers to municipalities by way of the national representatives, to develop new forms of participation which should also be for young people outside youth organisations. Conceivable options range from youth parliaments and conventions to competitions in schools and sport clubs. The political parties also have a great responsibility and should involve young people to a greater degree, encouraging them to take up political office. That will become very important in view of the elections to be held in 2004. We support the greater promotion of voluntary work for young people, but this is a kind of informal education and should be given recognition as such; legal and social protection for young people also needs to be improved. The motion for a resolution contains an array of further proposals, for example for making better use, for young people's purposes, of the Community programmes or indeed the Structural Funds. In order to do that, they will have to have better data with which to work. The Pisa survey in the educational field has shown how a youth report to be drawn up every three years, with comparable statistics and indicators from the Member States and the candidate countries, can serve as a significant basis for a broadly-based debate and for further political decisions, but there is a need for other coordinated measures as well, for example – as the catastrophe in Erfurt shows – to prevent violence. An Internet portal is not a sufficient discussion forum for the purposes of informing young people, as there are marked geographical and gender-specific, as well as social, differences in the way the Internet is used. My proposal is for innovative material to be developed in the language young people use and for the European Union's youth work to be presented to the wider public in a week of activities every year. But, ladies and gentlemen, nothing is any good unless it results in action. The White Paper on youth policy can only be a first step, a first and important step set in motion by the Commission in order to establish contact with many young people and with actors. Such a thing cannot be had for free. There must now be measures that cannot be financed out of the Youth Programme, 99% of which is exhausted, and so these good proposals cannot be realised. The Council of Ministers now has to take a quick decision on this at the end of this month. We need a green light for the White Paper. Then we must act together to swiftly implement further proposals, including some on the Budget, for I was at many of these European and also national conferences and spoke with the young people, and I can tell you that nothing could be more devastating to our work with young people and to their view of us than for their high hopes not to be fulfilled and for no measures now to result.

Mr President, Commissioner, my heartfelt thanks are due today to Mrs Martens and Mrs Avilés Perea for their reports on the programme of action for mainstreaming gender equality in development cooperation and on the annual report for 2000. I think there are a number of parallels between them, and Social Democrat members can note with satisfaction that yet another building block has been added to implement the platform of the Beijing Conference on Women. The framework strategy of gender mainstreaming is being implemented consistently. We are facing a thorough analysis of the problem and see here clear instructions as to how it is to be implemented on a regional and national basis. Gender awareness is in the meantime becoming accepted among some decision-makers, and we know that sustainable development must first begin with women. We also know that sustainable development cannot be had for free, and so it is appalling that the Budget allocation for gender-specific development cooperation, which was EUR 5 million as recently as 1998, was cut by 60% in 2001. How is a change in thinking to be brought about? Incidentally, I recall that the Member States had undertaken to utilise 0.7% of their gross national product for development aid. We are nowhere near approaching that. If we do not act without delay, the credibility of the so-called developed countries will be at stake. I also ask the Commission what became of the ‘gender desk’ in development cooperation. How are we to improve reproductive health and family planning, improving access to contraception – which includes ensuring the prevention of HIV/Aids – and, moreover, get these things into rural areas, if we do not replenish Budget resources to a marked degree? Political discussion may well have enabled us to rescue from the realm of taboo practices which demonstrate contempt for the personal value of women, such as genital mutilation, public floggings, stonings, violence and sexual abuse, to blow the whistle on them on the international stage and also combat them politically, but there is also a need for practical implementation. We need consistent annual reviews such as that in Mrs Avilés Perea's report, in order to be able to examine the facts. That is why my group supports both reports. We can do no other than back them up entirely and call on the Commission to make these noble objectives a reality.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the great merit of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's report is that it has triggered another wide-ranging debate about the influence of religious fundamentalism on the emancipation of women. On behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome the report, which emphasises Europe's responsibility for ensuring respect for fundamental rights and democratic principles as well as the secularity of nation states. Throughout the world, however, women's rights are being restricted or breached on the pretext of religious or cultural traditions or the law. This does not apply only to Islamists, but also to other religious groups. After difficult negotiations, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is proposing more than 30 paragraphs of specific measures, which have met with the agreement of four groups. We deeply regret the fact that of all groups the Christian-Democratic Group was not prepared to take part in compromise negotiations. The rapporteur was willing to do so. The need to fight against the suppression mechanisms of the fundamentalists should, after all, be the subject of a consensus. The Afghan Taliban provided us with an example of how they first jettisoned women's rights, then forced women to wear the burka, and finally denied them education and medical care and cut them off from any kind of paid employment. In a joint declaration, the Women's Rights Committee in the European Parliament and the women of the Council of Europe call for an international group of female observers to be set up to see that Afghan women have their unrestricted human rights restored to them. We condemn any kind of fundamentalism, offence or crime for reasons of so-called honour, such as stoning or genital mutilation or withholding reproductive rights, and that includes in Europe. Within the EU, we need to influence immigration laws and asylum policy so that reasons for persecution which are gender-specific or not related to a particular state are recognised. In my country this is the subject of a major debate and there too it is the Christian-Democratic Group which is refusing to compromise. (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unique thing about the Youth Programme is that it really is open to all young people and, at an age when characters are formed, facilitates direct European experiences to do that, and gives their lives the European dimension. The European Youth Programme was adopted on 13 April 2000 and runs for seven years up to 2006. It is aimed at young people of between 15 and 25 years of age as well as at people involved in the youth work field and is funded with EUR 520 million. Thirty countries take part in the programme – the Member States, and also Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and the candidate countries with the exception of Turkey and Malta. Its management is highly decentralised, so that 70% is spent via the national agencies. In 2000, 10 029 projects, costing something over EUR 80 million, were financed, enabling 103 784 participants to be involved, which corresponds to an implementation rate of 98.5%, which is an excellent quota, bearing in mind the late start to the programme. As we had wished, it was possible, in the various actions, to achieve balanced allocation of resources between youth exchange and voluntary service. We would, though, like the Commission to give us even clearer and sounder figures for the five action areas when the more detailed report is forthcoming. Action 1 – Youth for Europe – covers meetings of groups of young people and youth exchange, and Action 2 – European voluntary service – is aimed at young people who go to another country for between six and twelve months to do voluntary work. Action 3 comprises initiatives in the field of youth work, Action 4 supports initiatives that transcend the boundaries of Socrates and Leonardo. In 2000, there were no projects in Action 5, which deals with support measures. Over and over again, in the first year of the programme, we heard complaints about the length of time it took to process applications. As a rule, it took four to five months from the date the application was made for the centrally-managed projects to grant funds. Thankfully, the Commission picked up on our criticism in the course of the procedure and arranged for things to be speeded up. I hope that we will continue to work well with the Commission in this area in order to guarantee the participants in the projects speedy and unbureaucratic procedures. There were also start-up problems in the distribution of the appropriations for the programme to the national agencies. I hope that the funds advanced do not give rise to further incidental costs and make matters too difficult for the projects. It is extremely difficult to carry out a gender-specific assessment of the programme. I would like us to get more precise data from the Commission and for them to take care to work towards gender balance in the participants, in order, above all, that young women, including those from groups of disadvantaged young people, do not lose out. One of Parliament's priorities was to involve disadvantaged young people in the programme to a greater extent. According to the Commission, 50% of the centrally-managed projects were able to include disadvantaged young people. This was more difficult in the decentralised projects. There is a need for further work here. There is also a need to improve the way national agencies share experience with each other. The involvement of the candidate countries was accompanied by some difficulties, with the legal basis being adopted rather late in the day and the granting of visas often being problematic. It is my plea, as a matter of urgency, for participants from the candidate countries to receive visas automatically, in an unbureaucratic way and without charge. Overall administration costs in the first year were very high, and this was because the Commission had met the costs for two years in advance. I think that is acceptable. We also welcomed the objective of involving smaller organisations without international experience, so that young people who are not members of organisations can also have better access to the programme. We intend to be continually on the ball about this. It is because I believe that our successes need to be sold better and with vigour that I suggest that we mount a week-long campaign in order to present the programme to the public. Let me say in conclusion that the Member States must not cut back on their own youth exchange programmes. They must introduce the European dimension into their national policies to a greater extent. We are getting encouraging indications from the process of consultation on the White Paper and I hope that the Youth Programme's new impetus for Europe's young people will give us the core of this new youth policy.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to achieve the ambitious objectives set in Lisbon and make the EU a knowledge-based economic area and the most competitive and dynamic in the world, we must first step on the accelerator, then define its target groups more clearly, and finally apply the instruments with greater consistency. If the proportion of women in employment is to be increased to 60% by 2010, the Member States will have to become more pro-active – as they did when combating youth unemployment – and set benchmarks, in order to promote women in the seminal information technologies. Their share still ranges only between 10% and 20%, with the percentage of women owning small and medium-sized enterprises under 20%. The representation of women at the top in business management is only 10% at most. What has become of their impetus? Although the structural regulations include equal treatment of women as a priority and the strategy framework on gender mainstreaming holds remedies in readiness, women earn, varying between countries and business sectors, between 20% and 30% less than their male colleagues. Young women expect much from Europe and are demanding flexible child care facilities, and, Mr President-in-Office, so are the children's fathers, because they share responsibilities and want to combine work and family life. European initiatives such as lifelong learning and Community initiatives such as EQUAL take this into account. Now is the time for further steps to be taken. New forms need to be created, and we do not want women to be disappointed, as they are by the Convention, where, unfortunately, only 20% of the delegates are women. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her sound analysis and for her excellent collaboration in the drafting of this report. I think we can refer back to the Beijing World Conference of Women, where, too, steps were taken towards women's empowerment and capacity building, and the MEDA programme actually provided us with the right instruments. I must say, though, that we lack the statistical data to carry out a more exact and more precise analysis. For example, the data is not in the report on the programme, and no yardstick has as yet been laid down against which progress can be measured. Why was it that MEDA I and II included not even one regional programme exclusively devoted to women? Why is the democratic clause not applied with greater thoroughness where there is flagrant violation of women's rights, as with genital mutilation, for example? The Valenciano Martínez-Orozco Report gives important pointers to that. Why is fundamentalism not addressed in greater detail? I ask the women from the other groups, though, to pluck up the courage to introduce these issues into the Plenary rather than having their treatment obstructed in the Bureau. I ask myself why women are barred from education in many countries. It is a destructive tendency. Particularly in rural areas, up to 60% of women are excluded from education, even from being taught about reproductive health. Why, for example, do our Member States, when dealing with immigration and asylum, not show a very emphatic red card to the illegal trade in human beings? In the Member State from which I come, for example, the recognition of gender-specific persecution or any persecution that is not carried out by the State as grounds for asylum is currently being made into an electoral issue, and the good starts we have made in our immigration law therefore end up being put out of the reach of women in the Mediterranean. I think this is an area where women like us need to work together even more. With this report, we are setting a good example. Not only do we need more women performing social functions here, we also need them in our partner countries, and I emphasise again that the European Union must focus its instruments of cooperation even more intensely on women, so that it is to the advantage of us all that we, with the help of the democracy programme, empower women and open up dialogue.

Mr President, Commissioner, unless women are involved, there will be no lasting peace in Afghanistan. That was the most important message to come out of the Afghan women's summit convened in Brussels on 5 and 6 December with the support of the EU. Around 50 leading representatives from every social group in the country attended the conference, in a bid to make the voice of Afghan women heard in the current international political debate. We are delighted that the UN-Afghanistan conference held in parallel in Bonn decided to appoint at least two women, including one as deputy prime minister, to the transitional government. Our summit in Brussels certainly helped here. They can count on our support, but more needs to happen. We insist that women be given a good chance and be selected as candidates in future elections at all political levels. That means they need support and practical help now in a special democracy programme. Care must be taken in any future negotiations to ensure that Afghan women are fully integrated in efforts to resolve conflicts and in ongoing peace talks. The whole world and the media are watching at present and this must be used to build up new structures and ensure that the voice of Afghan women is heard. My group will use International Women's Day in 2002, just as it did in 1998, to maintain the wave of support in favour of averting a humanitarian disaster. The new watchword of the Social Democrats, who have been highlighting the plight of women under the Taliban regime for years, is this: no project for the future of Afghanistan and no form of political agreement will be accepted unless women are fully involved. We are calling for a group of leading Afghan women to be set up to coordinate international support, with a corresponding contact for assistance from the EU. The women and girls of Afghanistan have had to withstand 20 years of war and constant infringement of their human rights. But that does not mean they were condemned to silence. Afghan organisations such as the RAWA have worked hard to resist the Taliban regime. There is no reason to believe that things will be much better under the Northern Alliance, which is why we must support the courage and determination of the RAWA today. This morning we put budgetary arrangements in place to support NGOs such as the RAWA. But we need staying power and committed women to ensure that women get peace, freedom and equality in Afghanistan. We must not let up until women's rights are fully respected as human rights under the future constitution. (Applause)

Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I submitted a series of amendments which principally endeavoured to enshrine the principle of gender mainstreaming in the Sixth Research Framework Programme, which is in any case the largest programme, for which we are voting approximately EUR 17 billion. Concentration on other topics has meant, as Mrs Fraisse has already explained, that there has been less research into gender issues and less emphasis upon opening science and research to the full range of people with the right potential. In 1999, 66% of the research workers in the State sector and 72% of those in higher education were men. In only a few countries did the proportion of women exceed 40%, and that was in Ireland and Greece. Only in Portuguese higher education, with 53%, was a balance achieved. Women are particularly underrepresented, at 9%, in academic teaching posts in Germany. The highest levels were in Finland with 36%. It is therefore in the European interest and adds value if women are involved in research and teaching at every stage, from planning, via decision-making to project management, as well as in EU initiatives for prizes and competitions in all disciplines. I had already demanded this in this House in connection with the McNally Report on women and science, and, in order to implement it, the Commission set up a Gender Unit, which now has some early successes to show. Focused efforts have achieved a percentage of nearly 40% of women involved in the EU's research bodies and the same proportion receiving Marie Curie scholarships. We must, then, build on the successes of the Fifth Research Framework Programme, one contribution to which might be the doubling of the budget in the 'Science and Society' subdivision, and here, too, there is a need for research into gender issues. One final remark: In my language, the entire draft has to be revised in gender-neutral language, because we are setting the course for the future, above all for young women scientists.

Mr President, it was announced that Amendment No 35 would not be dealt with as it does not concern all the language versions.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala very sincerely for the enormous amount of work that we have achieved together here. This proposal became necessary because appeals had been made to the European Court of Justice in over 40 cases. The most prominent cases, which we in the European Parliament have also been very much involved in, a point I would like to reiterate, were the Kalanke and Marshall cases. These cases have important ramifications not only in Germany, but have also led to a degree of legal uncertainty throughout the Union. The anti-discrimination provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and Articles 141 and 3 give us a clear legal basis for amending this directive now so as to improve the position of women. Many of the extensive amendments at first reading are reflected in the common position. That is our first achievement. Direct and indirect discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, positive action – these are now all covered by the common position. Nevertheless, we are now going a step further. We want to protect not only mothers but also fathers, something that, as is reflected here, originally met with some resistance in this House. But that is what we expect. I think that we now need to find some clearer wording. In the course of various extended working sessions, we have managed to achieve a broad consensus in this Parliament on 15 compromise proposals. I accordingly wish to recommend that my group should stick to this compromise. Our objective remains that of rapidly improving the position of both men and women who are committed to their family, and working towards reconciling professional and family commitments. We want to create a clear legal framework. That is why if it proves necessary we want to initiate the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible. We hope that the compromise before us here will hold up and that the Commission and the Council will accordingly also display a willingness to agree, for the benefit of women.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and a few gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Ms Valenciano for her outstanding report, which sends out a very clear message: genital mutilation is a human rights violation! Various reasons are given to justify this human rights violation in the name of traditional culture or religion. In reality, this is an instrument which is intended to perpetuate women's oppression. Women who do not want to practise genital mutilation are excluded from society; as outcasts, they face unimaginable poverty and disgrace. This grave assault on women, which irreparably damages their bodies, minds and health, has gone largely unnoticed. It was only the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 which initiated a global debate and solidarity process and called for the international community to take joint action. We also encounter genitally mutilated women in Europe, as well as many different perpetrators and accomplices. Although FGM is punishable in many countries, the media and self-help organisations report that there are an estimated 5000 cases in Germany alone, and around four times as many cases involving girls being sent back to their countries of origin to be mutilated. There are unscrupulous doctors and other individuals who earn between DM 1000 and 3000 per case. The Socialist Group demands that at-risk women be granted asylum, perpetrators be punished, and that we proceed in accordance with the principle of extraterritoriality. Let me make this very clear: for my group, this is an important point, and we completely fail to understand why some sections of the PPE-DE – or indeed, the group as a whole – intend to abstain on this asylum issue, have no intention of voting for the report, and are thus abandoning women to their fate. The fight against ignorance and oppression must be fought at international level, and the Socialist International has therefore launched a worldwide campaign against violence against women. Fifteen states have already banned FGM, including nine African countries. More support must be given. My government in Germany has already allocated DM 3.8 million for education work and projects. The EU is helping with DAPHNE. Yet this is just a drop in the ocean. We must work together to fight for reproductive health and combat AIDS and genital mutilation. Then we will have a chance of reaching women and giving them the help they need.

 Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I welcome this reform of the 1996 Equal Treatment Directive and congratulate Mrs Hautala on her truly immense work to achieve a consensus in this House. The amendment of the directive comes at the right time now that we finally have a sound legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and it contains more detailed provisions to protect women from discrimination in their professions and in the workplace. In my view, this is a genuine building block and a contribution to the overall strategy of gender mainstreaming. With our amendments to the text proposed by the Commission, the directive's scope of application becomes broader and more specific. We put forward practical definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in the workplace. For the first time, sexual harassment in the workplace is recognised as discrimination on grounds of sex, and our amendments offer women workers various ways of defending themselves, including recourse to an independent body. We have also introduced a woman's right to return to her own job or an equivalent job under terms and conditions which are not less favourable to her after maternity leave. We are again tabling an amendment to protect fathers who apply for parental leave as well. They are still few in number. Europe-wide, just 2% of fathers claim this right, and these progressive fathers must not be excluded from our efforts. I hope that this proposed amendment will be widely supported by this House. In my view, this too is an essential building block for the gender mainstreaming process. We Social Democrats want to break open old and entrenched structures and ensure that role stereotypes are no longer perpetuated. The directive imposes an obligation on Member States to take action against discrimination. It is thus a move away from voluntary, non-binding provisions. I think that this too will encourage debate about this particular issue in Germany. The text also calls for the extension of the Equal Treatment Directive to the private sector. After the cases which we have witnessed, I hope that together, we can now finally make progress for women.

 Mr President, in the matter of e
-Learning I think we must above all realise that we are entering an entirely new world, that we are exploring new things and should not therefore keep to well-trodden paths. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has once again found that women are still largely excluded from the Web. Internet activities and everything that goes with the New Economy
 are still not the brave new world so far as women are concerned, as, incidentally, was also noted recently at a major international conference in Hamburg. Eighteen countries contributed their experience. There is a digital discrepancy. The ratio of women to men on the Internet is in the region of one to four. It is true that access is improving, but among people beginning their studies there are still only around 20% women compared to 80% men. When it comes to the formation of Internet-related companies, the proportion of women is still vanishingly small. We are therefore calling for new access to be created specifically for women, for special software to be developed for women, because they use the Internet differently and because women are still lagging a long way behind in qualifications. If we want to act on the resolutions of the Lisbon Summit and create a knowledge-based society, we must pay particular attention to women. We must, for example, abandon coeducation in some matters. We must tread new paths here. I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans. Here, too, we find that American women already have much greater access to the Internet. In some fields they have actually overtaken men. I think we still have a good chance of achieving something here with our action plan. I therefore ask that, in formulating the action plan, particular attention be paid to developing a greater and more specific involvement of women.

Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities considers that the implementation results of the budget-lines covering the promotion of equal opportunities between men and women were in general satisfactory. However, we have no line for the horizontal policy of gender mainstreaming
, i.e. incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities. We therefore call upon you to continue to give high priority to this policy area and invite you to carry out a gender impact assessment of expenditure, especially as regards the Structural Funds, the research programme, and all investments in the information society. I think it is important for us to obtain precise data on how the resource outflows are taking place, and so the Committee on Women's Rights calls upon the Court of Auditors to produce a special report on the financial implementation of gender mainstreaming
. This was done once before, in 1998, and the policy measures were clearly defined in the report. This would enable us to target our policies more strongly on this area.
Gröner (PSE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is for every female citizen of the EU to have access to decision-making processes at local, regional, national and European level. Equal participation for women in political and social decision making is not only our legitimate right, but a social necessity. We do not just enrich a man’s world; we are participating in all areas of this supposedly male world. As the new millennium dawns, we are continuing to fight alongside our colleague Mrs Karamanou, who I would like to thank sincerely for her persistence and hard work, in order to move closer to the objective of equality in the distribution of power between men and women. It has been a long haul from the first women's suffrage, in Finland in 1904, to gender-balanced political lists in France, and we still have a long way to go before we can take women presidents, mayors, ministers and party chairs for granted as a part of everyday life. The European Union has made considerable progress in this regard. We have now been able to increase the proportion of women in the European Parliament to 30%, and it is, incidentally, markedly higher in the left-wing groups than in the Conservative and more right-wing groups. 25% of the Commission is made up of women, and the figure is 24.8% in the governments of the Member States and 22.5% in national parliaments. I am pleased to bear glad tidings from my own country. Since the last government reshuffle in Germany, women now make up 37.5% of the Federal German Government, and this has been achieved by my party, by my political family. We are therefore confident about our own role and can act as a driving force for equal rights and the demands arising from the Karamanou report. I must call upon the House to support the rapporteur, Mrs Karamanou, as regards the three issues just raised by Mr Mann, and stick to the original text presented by the committee. It would be a mistake to reject quotas, as the parties are being urged to do. Furthermore, we also supported quotas as advocated in the report to the World Conference on Women in Beijing. The right thing is to keep all mechanisms open.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are now discussing Commissioner Diamantopoulou’s second tour de force. 
With the framework strategy and the new action programme in place, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities – working under intense time pressure, and restricted to only a few official languages – has now, with a great deal of good will, introduced 60 proposed amendments. I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicole Péry, will be able to get through the programme in the Council in November. I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme, when the erstwhile Federal Government under Helmut Kohl halved the budget, no less. Time is pressing. Women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision-making processes. According to EUROSTAT, approximately 77% of the recipients of low wages are women. Depending on the country and sector, women earn up to 30% less than their male counterparts. The framework strategy must be brought to bear in this regard as well. All the equal opportunities initiatives should be coordinated under one roof and translated into the five, specific, strategic goals. Other speakers have made the same point. That would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept. I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes. We also want to see the leading politicians on our side, and call upon President Prodi, the Council, and the Ministers, to take full account of the gender aspect, for example in the context of the European Union’s foreign relations, and particularly where the enlargement process is concerned. More emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women’s organisations, which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme. Our parliamentary committee plans to stage a conference on this specialist policy area, together with the parliamentary committees of our Member States and of the candidate countries, in November in Berlin. I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy. This is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women’s rights in Europe.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Nicole Péry for giving us high hopes of the French Presidency, which has made great strides with its law on equality. Electoral lists comprising 50% men and 50% women could be worth emulating. However, we are still awaiting the decision regarding a formal Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, we are only ever referred to other Councils of Ministers for a decision. We do not want to wait any longer. Other speakers have made the point: we want political action. It is high time for decisions on equal pay for equal work, i.e. for Articles 141 and 13 to be implemented. The Charter of Fundamental Rights has to be more than a fine proclamation. What we need are concrete implementation measures that will enable people to reconcile a career with family life. The Fifth Action Programme will assist us in this, but we as a European Parliament have already come some way ourselves. We have created a network of committees on equality with our female counterparts in the national parliaments, and in November, we will be meeting our female counterparts from the Member States, as well as those from the candidate countries. We did the same thing, incidentally, in New York, at the Beijing + 5 Conference. I was the rapporteur in Peking and the co-rapporteur in New York. The Polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of Polish women. I met with some very positive responses there. I would like to remind our President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, of the important speech he made here. There must be no glass ceilings in the European edifice. The European Parliament employs 30% women, which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions. The Commission has 25% women, so at least there is an upward trend. The European Court of Justice could do better, as only two of its fifteen judges are women. Yes, and the picture looks very gloomy in the Council on the equal opportunities policy front. All I can say there, is that the Council is what you might call a developing country where equality for women is concerned. We have every reason to be concerned. We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality. That gives us great cause for concern, and we expect that as well as stepping up the pace in matters of equal opportunities policy, there will also be concrete measures.

 Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Damião, who has set out excellent requirements in her report. The Commission, though, has side-stepped some key issues in its evaluation report, which it submitted almost four years late. After 1992, the Member States allowed important years to pass when they could have introduced improvements for millions of mothers and prepared themselves for the changed framework conditions in the information age. There are too many loopholes in the directive, the question of the reversal of the burden of proof is not settled, nor is the question of financial contributions, which clearly reflects a need for substantial improvement. Employers regard their contributions as cost factors they will do their best to avoid. But for many women, that obviously means they have to make a decision: job or child. However, their desire for economic independence must not force them to decide between the alternatives of either a career or a child. The right to choose is a human right, applying to both women and men, and the possibility of reconciling family life and a job is a key social democratic demand. Pregnancy is not an illness and we must change the situation where pregnant women and new mothers have to give up their income during the period of legal protection and where for women collectively the potential ability to bear a child leads to discrimination on the labour market. Here we need to change Community law. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities will spearhead the EU in the fight to increase maternity leave to 20 weeks and drastically reduce the number of derogations, such as in the hotel and restaurant trade. Special assistance needs to be provided for high-risk pregnancies and multiple births and 21st century society needs to take the health of mothers-to-be seriously. I hope those colleagues who are chatting so animatedly among themselves also take it seriously. We must speak with one voice in order to implement ILO Convention No 103, and for small and medium-sized undertakings we must regulate the assistance elsewhere, for instance in the Treaty and not in this directive.

Mr President, the European Union brought women’s rights throughout the world to the fore in New York. They were tough negotiations, which is why the Portuguese Presidency deserves special thanks for speaking not only on behalf of the 15 Member States, but also on behalf of the associated countries, with the exception of Poland, as do the Commission and the Commissioner and her negotiators, who worked together with the Parliament delegation in an exemplary manner. That is most unusual, so here too special thanks. And fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the European Union. Our unity allowed our opinion to prevail in the progressive countries and to make significant progress in the twelve crucial areas. At no time did the European Union brook any watering down of the Beijing action platform, although it is, of course, a pity here that we did not have a resounding success on every count and that the clear language in Article 13 on non-discrimination and sexual rights is not reproduced in the outcome document from New York. As already mentioned, we have the fundamentalist countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and even the Vatican to thank for that. But this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women’s rights in New York and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned. We now have specific measures in place in many countries to combat the cruel practice of genital mutilation, the issue of HIV/AIDS was addressed and the role of women in the peace process, ignored hitherto, was recognised as an issue. The fight against violence was put on every country’s agenda. Access to capital, the role of men – very important, we would like to see more men taking part in the process – still need to be promoted. We tabled our document, our report, in New York as an official UN document, another major success. I think the resolutions of Parliament and our progress in the European Union, Parliament’s progress, are now accessible to every country. We were very successful with the initiative to invite parliamentarians twice and have speeded up the implementation of the action platform. We came to the clear conclusion with our partners from associated countries that we need to work together more closely in order to promote women’s rights. We want to have a parliamentarians’ conference in two years to review Beijing. We insist on another world women’s conference in five years to ensure that the process continues. We must all make a joint effort to ensure that the subject of gender mainstreaming, equal opportunities for men and women, stars on the world political agenda. It is in our interest to fight for this. I think, and this is my personal opinion, that it is also in our interest to fight to ensure that this happens in Eastern Europe. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five years after Beijing, the implementation of the action platform is to be subjected to detailed analysis. We in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities have formed a critical appraisal of the twelve critical areas of concern, which are: poverty; education and training; health; violence; armed conflict; the economy; power and decision making; institutional mechanisms; human rights; media; the environment and the girl child. It now all depends on how we use the political will to bring about improvement in these areas.   I would emphasise that the cooperation between the two co-rapporteurs has been highly constructive and we have focused on the measures taken by the EU and its Member States in this report. We endeavour to highlight any shortcomings and to make a series of recommendations that will help to speed up implementation of the action platform. I also see this report as an action plan for the EU delegation that is to take up an excellent negotiating position in New York, in June, and that is to strengthen women’s rights, in close cooperation with the representatives of governmental and non-governmental organisations. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Belém, and the Commissioner, for the fact that we worked so well together during the preparation process for the conference held in Brussels in February, and I hope that things will run as smoothly in future preparation processes. We can go to New York with a whole string of achievements to our credit. The incorporation of equal opportunities into all policy areas, i.e. gender mainstreaming, has now been adopted as the guiding principle in a wide cross-section of EU policy areas. The accompanying positive action measures will be followed up in the fourth action platform, and no doubt in the fifth platform as well.   Notwithstanding the considerable progress we have made, one of our main tasks will be to turn rights into practice at long last. The Treaty of Amsterdam will help us there; specifically Articles 2 and 3, in which equality is defined as a goal and task of the Community, or Article 141, relating as it does to employment policy, where there is room for improvement. However, we still need a completely secure legal basis. The Treaty must include a single, coherent legal basis for equality between men and women in all policy areas, and another directive on the implementation of the positive action measures in Article 141. The fifth action platform is of prime importance and is ultimately also a decision-making Women’s and Equal Opportunities’ Council.   I believe – and my co-rapporteur has already highlighted this – that the European Union should step up cooperation and emphasise the gender perspective principle in its foreign relations, in the context of the enlargement process and with developing countries. If the empowerment of women proves to play a major part in the Fourth World Conference on Women, it will also take precedence where the development of the information society is concerned. It is all about jobs – we have taken careful note of this – about future tasks, so as to ensure that women are not the losers in the globalisation competition.   We have also developed an impressive repertory of measures designed to boost employment. However, the situation with regard to equal pay still leaves a lot to be desired. For people to be able to combine family life with careers, consideration must be given to both fathers and mothers, and the image of the new man, who takes on domestic tasks, must be reinforced.   The situation is looking brighter for women as far as equality in political life is concerned. Women account for an average of 20% of members of the parliaments of the European Union. The figure for this Parliament is 30%. But there is still plenty of room for improvement in this regard as well, so as to reach the critical mass, as it were. I believe I can say, with the full support of my Group, that there is no getting away from the fact that we must introduce quotas. We must fix quotas at long last, if we do not want it to take another one hundred years before women achieve equal representation, and I mean in every single walk of life, in the economy, at social partner level, in universities and in science. We must also achieve a more gender-balanced participation within the mass media industry.   Violence against women is another major issue. Here in the European Parliament, we have called for there to be a European year against violence, and are supported by 350 delegates in this. Much still remains to be done, however. The important thing to come out of New York will be a decision on Beijing + 10, another World Conference on Women for the 21st Century.   (Applause)

Mr President, I would like to thank all of you for holding out for so long. I welcome the compromise we have reached on the Community action programme “Youth” and the outcome of the conciliation procedure. Although some prayers remained unanswered, the parliamentary delegation could be satisfied with EUR 520 million for the seven year term, with a review clause on the accession of the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe. I would like to thank all those who took part for their cooperation, particularly Commissioner Reding and her offices, the Portuguese President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fontes, who certainly did not have an easy time of it at the hands of the Finance Ministers, and I would also like to thank the youth forum for its input. The negotiations for the Youth programme have dragged on for around one and three quarter years. We have drastically amended the original proposal by the Commission, which envisaged combining the existing programmes “Youth for Europe” and the European Voluntary Service in one five year programme. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport tabled 61 amendments at first reading, aimed at achieving a balanced weighting of the various parts of the programme and using the distinctly larger budget to enable more young people than the 500 000 or so that had already benefited hitherto, to enjoy the experience of an exchange programme.   We wanted to simplify administrative structures and do more to develop disadvantaged young people. The Commission adopted a raft of amendments put forward by Parliament, however the Council was unable to reach agreement on a common position concerning EUR 350 million for a five-year programme. At second reading, the European Parliament concentrated on 13 Amendments, focusing largely on the Budget, on a seven-year term following the example of Socrates and Leonardo, and on a flexible age limit and social protection in matters of comitology.   Immediately after second reading, I entered into informal negotiations with the Finnish Presidency, so as not to lose any time and so as to ensure the programme makes a seamless transition at the beginning of the new millennium. We have the Council to thank for the fact that the conciliation procedure was not opened until the Portuguese Presidency took office. The Council accepted neither our budget proposal of EUR 980 million nor the well-founded compromise from the Commission of EUR 765 million.   At the second meeting of the conciliation committee we were able, following difficult negotiations, to reach agreement on all issues. The seven-year term with a budget of EUR 520 million and the review clause following the accession of central and eastern European countries was a coup on the part of the European Parliament delegation. The fact that we secured social protection for the young participants from their home country, and sickness insurance cover in the host country was another coup, likewise the fact that age limits are to be kept flexible and not rigid.   But, as rapporteur, I welcome the fact that the Youth programme is enabling us to send out a signal that the programme really is open to all young people. Both boys and girls are participating in the programme, and we have opened it to students, the unemployed, young people from the Member States, candidate countries or third countries. We have made it possible to hear more about young people’s needs and ideas over the Internet, and to engage in active dialogue with them. Who could imagine a better opportunity and better advertisement for the European core values?   Provided we make intelligent use of it, the Youth Programme could help to overcome Europe fatigue, and optimist that I am, I believe it could generate enthusiasm for Europe. Therefore my advice to you all is to make use of the opportunities that the new youth programme has to offer. I would recommend that you vote in favour of the joint text on the introduction of the Community action programme “Youth”.   (Applause)

 Madam President, this is actually about an event which has taken place since the last sitting, a hearing held by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities. There was a grave danger of this House's reputation being damaged. You see, it emerged that during the plenary part-sessions there is a significant rise in prostitution in the area, in Strasbourg. I would cordially request that you look into this matter with the Strasbourg authorities and investigate whether criminal activity is at work here, and whether it is linked to trafficking in women and forced prostitution. I think that we need, as a matter of urgency, to send out a clear message to public opinion that we are doing something about this and I believe that the European Parliament cannot be indifferent to what is reported in public about what goes on on the fringes of plenary part-sessions.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council. At the beginning of this century, the French government sent out a beacon, a bombshell on the equality of opportunity policy front. For the first time, there must be equal representation of men and women on electoral lists. In taking this step, the Head of Government, Lionel Jospin, has also set down a marker for the European Union. It happens to be today that Finland’s newly elected President, Tarja Halonen, takes up office. And so the women in Finland have also set down a marker, for this is the first time they have had a female Head of State. Unfortunately, the same does not hold true everywhere. Sadly, less than 7% of the contenders for the next elections in Greece will be women. There, too, there is certainly a lot of catching up to be done. They did not follow the Council recommendation of 1996 on equal involvement for women and overcoming the under-representation of women. Although women form the majority of the European population, they are still largely on the sidelines. When they aspire to higher office they soon hit the glass ceiling. We should fight to break through this glass ceiling. Unlike the previous speaker, it is my belief – and my Group is united on this – that we should set quotas, and binding quotas at that, for women have worked hard. Women have an outstanding profile in the European Union; we have demonstrated team spirit and have acquired decision-making powers and social competences. Binding quotas also require reliable statistics and must not be excluded from any sector of society.  We need this new social treaty, we need the fight for power, money and distribution of work, which must favour women. Looking back, I would say that the men could have given us solid support in this fight. Unfortunately, they have made little effort in this regard as well.   It is my hope that we will continue to work on the Beijing Action Platform and that we will have the vision to progress from having a Women’s Day to a Women’s Millennium.

Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs McNally who was unable, due to unavoidable commitments, to stay and present the report herself. Women and science – Mobilising women to enrich European research. The communication proposes two objectives: the first is to stimulate discussion between the Member States and promote best practice in the encouragement of women in the fields of science and technology. The second is to increase the number of women involved in research supported by the Union, thereby meeting the Union’s Treaty commitments to equal opportunities and enriching research, i.e. to implement gender mainstreaming. Expenditure on research and technology is the third most important section of the European Union budget, after agriculture and the Structural Funds. We welcome the Commission’s communication and its objectives and invite the Member States to pursue the objective of gender equality and to cooperate with the Commission. We invite the Commission to produce comparable and improved data on the subject of Women and Science, to propose guidelines and further action and to deliver a special report to us here in Parliament within two years. The Commission will henceforth be working for more comparable data on women scientists and will arrange meetings between relevant parties and organise two major conferences which will bring together national civil servants, women scientists and all interested parties. The rapporteur expressly welcomes the measures already taken under the fifth framework research programme to increase the involvement of women and to insist that 40% of those participating in both the Marie Curie scholarships and all advisory committees are women and to incorporate the measures already proposed for the sixth framework programme. Women have traditionally been under-represented in scientific research and the women’s movement has had to fight hard to achieve the present position. At the beginning of the century, the first female Europeans attended university in Finland. However, university strongholds are still dominated by men and yet today nearly half the students are women. In my home country of Germany, for example, women entrants outnumbered men for the first time in 1995. The average ratio in Europe is 103 women to 100 men. Germany is bringing up the rear in the EU with 77 women to 100 men. In all events, more women than men graduate, at a ratio of 110:100. In Germany and Ireland this figure is lower. Two-thirds of female students now choose languages and humanities; more impetus is needed in the natural sciences. An understanding of natural sciences and technology must be fostered in the home and promoted generally through education, in school, in the kindergarten, everywhere and new paths must be opened. Coeducation is not always the only way forward; single-sex education can also provide an impetus, especially in the natural sciences and technology. However, the new potential to qualify which women now have has still not been implemented in practice; the situation regarding staffing at technical colleges is still disastrous and the number of ordinary chairs in the Union is 5%, hardly any higher than at the beginning of the century in the 1920s. However, equal opportunities for women in science must also bring about more input from women as regards content. Women and gender research must be seen as basic research which is of enormous importance to the European Union. The Member States must develop new instruments to increase the unused potential of all women in research and teaching and promote exchanges of experience. Networks of women scientists must be supported and innovative projects promoted and disseminated. For example, Spain and Italy are demonstrating a higher proportion of women in the natural sciences. This must be investigated more closely. There are also examples in Germany: Expo 2000 in Hanover in the summer will stage a 100-day international women’s university for technology and culture. One thousand budding female scientists and 100 female professors are working there on an interdisciplinary, research-orientated programme in seven project areas: intelligence, information, the body, water, the city, work and migration. These valuable experiences will be carefully combined and evaluated so that a decision can be taken as to whether the university can be continued as a virtual campus with modern information technologies. As a founder member of the women’s university, I am convinced that this think tank will show us how to resolve many of our problems. In the interests of European research and its position with reference to globalisation, the EU must not miss a single opportunity. Another chance will be the UN Peking +5 conference due to take place in the middle of the year in New York. This will take stock of successes and failures in achieving the objectives. The people with political responsibility in the European Union and in all the Member States must take consistent action to ensure that we make structural changes to framework conditions in conjunction with the governors of technical colleges, the boards of research institutes and the economy and introduce a process of change which implements the requirement to safeguard equal opportunities prescribed in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Our future lies in the 21st Century, as the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, has quite rightly demonstrated. We are not talking about cosmetic changes here; we need to make courageous incisions. Once again our warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McNally.

Mr President, the European Parliament was, and is, the driving force behind the implementation of the Beijing Action Platform, as the Commissioner has just acknowledged. We considered the fourth action programme on equal opportunities to be the consequence of it. We have tried to include the gender mainstreaming policy in all policy areas. We have launched specific measures such as those to combat violence against women. I was present as rapporteur for the European Parliament at both the NGO Conference in Beijing and at the Intergovernmental Conference of the 189 countries and I have, of course, followed developments over the last five years very closely, both in the European Union and in the developing countries. I recall that the EU spoke out for women with one voice under the Spanish Presidency of the Council and was able during negotiations to argue important points and include them in the Action Platform from this position of strength. That was the happy experience. That the Members of the European Parliament had an undetermined status and were not fully integrated in the European delegation was the less happy experience. The situation was different at subsequent negotiations, for example, at the WTO in Seattle. We should therefore continue to follow this new practice at future international conferences. This brings me to my specific question, which is directed mainly at the Council, and we expect an equally specific answer: what status will MEPs have at the next conference, the Beijing plus 5 Conference in New York? We are already involved with the Commission in preparing the content for the conference in February but we are still waiting for a clear message from the Council, since the question of if and how many members are to represent the European Parliament in New York has not yet been clarified. Time is running out. The ECE Conference, i.e. the UN Commission on Europe, is being held in Geneva in January and it is not clear whether we have been included in the delegation to it. We need a straight answer here today. Preparation of the content by the Commission, in which we have been included, is well under way. Firstly, the content of the twelve crucial areas defined in the Action Platform is being dealt with. Secondly, strategies are being clearly discussed. We do not want to formulate new objectives; what we want is a clear analysis and evaluation of where progress has been made in our Member States, where we should concentrate and where we should step up efforts so that the European Union can achieve progress in New York for the women of Europe and throughout the world?

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Avilés on getting to grips with this difficult subject so rapidly, which meant that we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have been able to present this report very quickly. Nevertheless, I would have liked to see more men involved in this work. Violence against women and children is after all a men’s problem, not a women’s problem. I am convinced that with this programme we have taken a big step forward in combating physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young persons and women. However, we all need to be aware that it is only one step, and that there is still a lot to be done to effectively combat this phenomenon of violence. In 1999 this House succeeded, in the face of persistent opposition, in initiating a campaign to counter violence against women. The Eurobarometer poll published this May made the extent of violence clear and identified the gaps where we need to take action. Europol and the STOP programme are instruments for combating trade in women. The Member States have committed themselves to do a great deal, which has, for instance, emerged from the campaigns. The complex interrelationships in the fight against violence have only really become clear because of the Austrian, German and Finnish Presidencies’ Conferences. My own country, for example, has as a result set up a national action plan against violence, and other countries are following suit. I think that we have given an important impetus to this. Mrs Avilés’ report on the common position was adopted after a great battle about changing the legal basis from Article 235 to Article 152, with the codecision procedure. But my own group only voted for it with great reservations and only because the World Heath Organisation definition, according to which health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, is now evidently recognised and taken as a basis by the Council. My group would have liked to see certain other changes of emphasis in the Daphne programme, for example links with other Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, 

because that is where the big money is, in order to initiate preventive measures and campaigns in the applicant countries. However, as regards reaching agreement quickly and avoiding the conciliation procedure, we agree with Mrs Avilés here, and are only recommending six amendments to the common position. In any case we recommend that the media should be involved in order to get the programme up and running. I would like to thank you very sincerely for your work and hope that the Council will accept our amendments.

 Mr President, on 20 November 1989 the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted, and I think that the tenth anniversary of that event is a good opportunity to take stock. Our Member States did indeed ratify the convention, even if in some cases it was with certain reservations, and they should now be removed as a matter of urgency. We Social Democrats have over the last ten years worked hard to secure a better hearing for children’s rights, and have emphasised these rights with various important reports and resolutions. This goes back to the Gröner report in 1991, in which Parliament for the first time dealt with children’s problems, and in which I was already demanding a children’s ombudsperson. I should also mention the Bandres Molet report on a European charter for children’s rights and last year’s Zimmermann report on minors. We have also given a very high level of political priority to children’s needs in various reports to the UN world conferences, in conjunction with third countries, and in particular with the ACP countries. In the course of this year, Parliament has submitted a succession of proposals to the Commission, and it now expects the Commission to produce a communication in which all these initiatives are brought together. The various tasks on the list of priorities should be tackled one by one. Right at the top of the list is the incorporation of fundamental children’s rights into the new treaty. Secondly, using the Daphne programme as a first step, as the first instrument for taking action to counter sexual exploitation and violence against children. Thirdly, there is the situation of girls and young women, which merits special attention in all areas of policy, as they are still exposed to particular discrimination not only here in Europe, but all over the world. Fourthly, we must do everything we can to ensure that children are not involved in wars, either as victims or aggressors. We do not want to see any more child soldiers anywhere in the world. Two minutes is very short and the list of tasks is a long one. Please take some action!

 – (DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission for responding so quickly to our own quick work. The principal task, however, still lies ahead of us, namely that of persuading the Council. The chief problem area can be found in the Budget. With Parliament’s demands for EUR 980 million, we are now facing a Council proposal of EUR 350 million, and another EUR 490 million in the seven-year programme. This is the area of the great debate which we face and, against the combined forces of the Commission and Parliament, it is now up to the Council to change.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on 28 August 1998, the Commission submitted a proposal for an order by the European Parliament and the Council to introduce the Community action programme, “Youth” for the period 2000-2004. The programme was passed on to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport as the Committee in overall charge. The existing youth programmes, “Youth for Europe III” and “European Voluntary Service” were combined in the Commission’s proposal and their objectives given more concentrated form. Our Committee has worked very quickly and efficiently and, on 28 October 1998, it unanimously adopted the de Coene report with 61 amendments. The plenary sitting accepted this report on a first reading on 5 November.  We wanted to give equal status to the European Voluntary Service and “Youth for Europe”. The proposed amendments were to bring the programme closer to young people and so to the European Union. Our emphases were, and are, on increasing the budget resources for the programme – the Commission had proposed EUR 600 million and ourselves EUR 800 million – in order to double the number of young people who are being targeted. Through our amendments, we wanted to help simplify the structures, improve communication with the target group, make the implementation procedures transparent, increase the participation of disadvantaged groups, spread information about the programme more broadly in order to improve access to it and, finally, make the age limits for participants more flexible in order, through the commitology, to find horizontal solutions.  The proposed programme was then blocked in the Council until, under the German Presidency, it resulted in a Common Position’s being adopted on 28 June, based on a proposed five-year programme involving EUR 350 million. That corresponds to an expenditure of less than EUR 0.20 per citizen per year for the youth exchange programme and is in the region of a per mill of the overall budget. I cannot imagine a European family without young people, nor any programme which neglects significant sections of the young population. The European Parliament therefore welcomes the fact that the Common Position in the form of a number of amendments is being passed to ourselves. We have been able, through the programme, to implement respect for human rights and also to combat racism and xenophobia. We have created a situation in which attention has been given to removing discrimination in such a way as to promote equality of opportunity between girls and boys and, in implementing these measures in cooperation with the Commission, the approach is user-friendly and youth oriented. We have succeeded in guaranteeing that the European Voluntary Service does not take the place of any potential or existing paid employment.  If now, with the unanimous support of Committee 13, I am bringing in further amendments, these relate first and foremost again to funding, duration and prevailing upon Member States to remove obstacles to gaining access to the programme. As the very first priority, social protection and access to medical care for young people must be ensured. Regulations could be laid down in this area, as they have been for student exchanges. It is also a question of introducing a structure for gathering information about young people and for setting up an Internet website for “Youth in Europe” and “Youth for Europe” in order, on an interactive basis, to reach new strata of young Europeans.  In order to be able to address young citizens directly, the importance of this programme, which is to commence at the beginning of next year, must be clear to everyone involved in the process. The “Socrates” and “Leonardo” programmes have shown that a seven-year programme can be more effective than a programme which runs for just a few years. I therefore recommend that a period of seven years be proposed here and that the financial framework for implementing this programme be set at EUR 980 million. I propose a mid-term review for the middle of the seven-year period, together with an evaluation and reassessment of the youth programme. A prerequisite for the success of the programme is a method of disseminating information which is not only directed at the initiated. We must succeed in getting young people enthusiastic about Europe and helping, for example, to foster in them an appetite for Europe and to mitigate their social or financial problems or the effects of living on the periphery of things. Age limits ought not to be rigidly adhered. The potency and the wealth of Europe lie in its diversity.  I again appeal to the Member States to make commitments regarding social protection and medical care. We respect the principle of subsidiarity but, in this area, the responsibility of the Member States must also have an effect. It is now a matter of ensuring that deeds follow the fine words spoken at summits. Informal contacts with the Presidency of the Council and with the Commission provide hope of agreement here, for young people and their associations expect not bureaucratic but pragmatic action from the European institutions, as well as cooperation between the latter. As an elected Parliament, we bear a responsibility.  As rapporteur, I shall do everything humanly possible to find a sustainable compromise, and I urge the Council to approach us, above all when the budget comes round. Europe’s future begins with the youth of today. That must be the message on 1 January when, hopefully, the new programme can come into effect.  (Applause)

 Mr President, a short comment. I should like to point out that the English text has been changed. In amendment 12, a portion of the proposal withdrawn by Mrs Scallon has found its way back into the German version. Spiritual undertakings ought to be included in the investigation of activities. This runs the risk of our suddenly also having sects for young people included in the programme. This part of the amendment had been withdrawn at the Committee stage. I would ask you to check the language versions for which the English text provides the basis.

 Mr President, I would like to start by saying that it is very difficult for me to get on with my work here in Strasbourg owing to the fact that for the second time now, my case of documents has failed to reach my office. I would like to thank all those involved in the budgetary procedure for their work, which had to be executed with very little room for manoeuvre and was intended to send out a message to all the citizens of Europe. We are able to do this as far as Category 3 is concerned, which relates to internal policies. The youth programme, the SOCRATES programme, the cultural programme and issues relating to women and equality all provide us with the opportunity to make clear to the citizens what we want to achieve. A mistake was made in the case of Category 3, that is to say, when the vote took place in the Committee on Budgets an amendment was adopted by a very slim majority which could cause considerable damage if it is not corrected. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities submitted a remark and a budget for the European Women’s Lobby in line A-3037, as it did the previous year, but the remark now states that this line is to be opened to all non-governmental organisations. May I remind you that we as a parliament have supported this umbrella organisation for European women’s organisations and have entrusted it with the task of implementing the plan of action agreed in Peking at non-governmental organisation level, and I think it would be disastrous if just any women’s organisation could have a share in this budget. That is why I would ask you all to correct the amendment again and to vote against Amendment No 443 and in favour of the amendment tabled by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. We weighed the situation up very carefully and exercised great restraint as regards the amendments relating to gender mainstreaming and the question of firmly establishing equal opportunities in all European policies. I would particularly ask the rapporteur to take this into account and to support the position of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.

 Mr President, Mr President-designate Prodi, we Social Democrats are disappointed. In spite of announcements, you have not succeeded in achieving a better balance between men and women in your new team. The EU Commission remains a male domain. The mission conferred in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to oppose all forms of discrimination, is still, for women at least, just a vague hope. We may speak the same European language, but you have not in fact understood us. A third of your candidates did not answer the question from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities about gender mainstreaming. The Social Democrats’ demand was and remains – again, I stress the word “remains” – to have in future an Equal Opportunities Commissioner with the power to implement equal opportunities. We demand that the College and yourself as its head become ambitious about gender mainstreaming, with measurable developments and improvements as a result. Mrs Diamantopoulou, whose portfolio includes equal opportunities alongside employment and the social dimension, has in fact shown a lot of commitment but, Mr Prodi, how will she react when she has been gagged by you in advance and when the struggle against violence, as well as the issue of non-discrimination, has been placed in other hands? You speak of a new balance, a new partnership, but do not waste a single word on the women of Europe who, at the end of the day, do represent half of our citizens. We want you to take steps to ensure that substantial improvements in income and in access to power and money are achieved, and that you join us in our struggle against violence and against the everyday discrimination faced by women.  Without the input from women, the idea of the big European family is meaningless.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will forgive me if I remain seated. I am not yet well enough to stand while I talk to you, but please do not think I am being rude. Also, I do not wish to talk for longer than necessary, but I would just like to thank everyone who has helped in preparing the report, which Commissioner Patten has said the Commission will take into account in the negotiations at the Moscow Summit. Thank you very much, Commissioner. (Applause)
 The fact that the debate on this report is being held in the right place, that is to say during a joint debate on the Russian Federation, makes it clear once again that we still believe it is up to the Russian Government to ensure that reasonable conditions prevail in Kaliningrad. A delegation from this House recently visited Kaliningrad, and anyone travelling through this region or walking through the city is bound to be horrified, unless they close their eyes. We had an opportunity to discuss matters with the mayor of Kaliningrad, who complained bitterly that the last visit by representatives of the European Union had raised hopes about the construction of a new hospital. In this context, help for patients with TB is particularly important. Everything that has been mentioned by the previous speakers – human rights issues, public health and environmental policy – are issues that must be tackled and where help is needed. One thing is sure, and we should not lose sight of this, because it also underscores what Commissioner Vitorino has said: there will be no real peace in Europe until we have managed to breathe life into the partnership and cooperation agreement. I hope we will succeed, but I will not be too concerned as long as the points mentioned here by the various representatives of the presidency, the Commission and of this House itself are also discussed at the Moscow Summit. Many thanks for giving me a few minutes' speaking time. I am sure we will continue to strive to ensure, working jointly where necessary, Mrs Lalumière, that what has been agreed by Parliament so far is actually implemented and becomes a practical policy. Thank you very much indeed! I would particularly like to thank Erika Mann, who, when I asked her if she would present my contribution here agreed to do so without hesitation. Thank you very much, Erika! (Applause)

 Mr President, in recent years the European Union has finalised various documents relating to the Russian Federation which form a good basis for close relations with it. The common strategy is one of them. Despite all its contradictions, Europeans clearly see Russia as part of Europe and have a huge interest in a stable, democratically-organised Russian Federation with good economic prospects which plays a confident part in and helps to shape international policy. The West also needs the Russian Federation as an important international partner if Europe is to be reshaped after the change. It is this interest which has led the Union to develop specific fields of activity in numerous areas in the common strategy towards the Russian Federation and other documents. They include consolidating the rule of law and strengthening government institutions. They also include developing a civil society as an important precondition to consolidating democracy. In the economic sector, the Union is endeavouring to integrate the Russian Federation into a common economic and social area. The Union is already the Russian Federation's most important processing, investment and trading partner, accounting for over 40%. But there is still huge potential here. Experts have calculated that trade between the European Union and the Russian Federation only accounts for one-third of what might be expected, given the Russian Federation's gross national product and its proximity to EU markets. In the political sector, the common strategy towards the Russian Federation proposes entering into a standing dialogue on policy and security and creating a permanent mechanism for such dialogue. It would be interesting to expound on this, but time is too short. The EU sets great store in its Russian policy by environmental protection and nuclear safety. Unfortunately, this momentum in relations between the Russian Federation and the EU has come up against a counter force – cue Chechnya, which has seriously hampered relations. The substance and methods of the internal consolidation being pursued by the Putin regime will have a significant influence on the nature of our relations. We can only hope that the current pragmatic and realistic partnership will perhaps one day become a real strategic partnership.

Mr President, Commissioner, my report on Lithuania’s application to join the European Union closes with the following sentence: It is still too early to establish a position on when and with whom Lithuania should accede, but efforts should be aimed at making possible a broad first enlargement wave in which Lithuania is included. Lithuania applied to join the Union on 8 December 1995. Accession negotiations commenced in February 2000. Lithuania’s target date for accession is 1 January 2004. The assessment of the political criteria for meeting accession requirements is – I hope all will agree – without question unreservedly positive. This month, on 8 October, Lithuania will be holding parliamentary elections. Whatever the outcome of these elections, we may safely assume that the main parties will lend their unwavering support to Lithuania’s accession to the European Union. Lithuania is on its way to joining the World Trade Organisation. Before I go on, a quick update: negotiations between Lithuania and the WTO were successfully concluded yesterday, meaning that Lithuania expects to join shortly following ratification. Today the Lithuanian economy is on the mend. There was negative fallout from the Russian economic crisis in 1998, due to the high level of trade with Russia, and the gross domestic product was still falling in 1998 and 1999. The macro-economic situation is now stabilising. Lithuania has considerable potential for long-term economic growth. The International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of 2.1% in the gross domestic product this year. There is a good chance of this, but particular efforts are still needed. Policy still needs to concentrate on creating the right conditions for innovation and modernisation in key sectors of the economy. The fact that the Lithuanian currency is still pegged to the dollar is also important here, because as the dollar rises, so too does the value of the litas against the euro. As a result, revenue from exports from Lithuania to the euro zone is down and, similarly, producers are of course facing stiffer competition on the domestic market from exporters in the euro zone. There are plans to peg the litas to the euro in the second half of 2001. As I said, despite a number of shortcomings and weaknesses, Lithuania has made good progress in the economic area and is only a short way away from a working market economic. As far as the Ignalina nuclear power station is concerned, there is no doubt that the two Chernobyl-type reactors need to be decommissioned. Lithuania voted an energy strategy through parliament at the end of 1999 and, in May of this year, the Seimas passed a law to decommission unit 1 in 2004. A decision on the decommissioning of unit 2 will then be taken in 2004. I am most grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for clarifying the question of the closure of nuclear power plants. It is an important point here too. Now to Kaliningrad. This issue requires a special effort and, in my view, cannot be dealt with purely as a problem on the fringe of the issue of the accession of Lithuania and Poland. In the widest sense, what is at stake here is cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation. The point at issue is whether Kaliningrad should be enclosed and cut off or included in the development prospects for the region. The multi-faceted problems and the dangers inherent in the social and economic crisis in the region will not be averted, let alone solved, by isolating it. Our motto in this case must be: stabilisation through cooperation. That is the only way of giving Kaliningrad a chance to improve its development potential. Lithuania is playing a positive role here. Lithuania and Russia recently presented proposals for joint projects in various areas under the NIDA initiative. The EU is being asked to adopt them in the Northern Dimension action plan. Ways of fostering good neighbourly relations need to be found in the interest of the region as a whole. And also in the interests of cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation.

Mr President, I would like to make another comment about Poland. The Polish people believe that the country will be ready for accession with effect from 31 December 2002, and Poland has certainly made great strides since the accession negotiations started in March 1998. There are already a number of progress reports available to us, and Parliament, which plays an important part in this process, has repeatedly made its feelings known on the subject. Parliament supports the Commission’s strategy, according to which, each candidate state should be dealt with and assessed on the basis of its own progress and merits. However, there are also problems requiring a cross-border solution. In Mr Gawronski’s report, the Commission is urged, by the rapporteur among others, to examine measures for furthering development and for strengthening the synergy between Poland, Lithuania and the Russian region of Kaliningrad. I feel it is entirely reasonable to ask this of the Commission, and that the Commission’s response should be to put forward a proposal. I have already made this point once this afternoon, on another occasion. All in all, when it comes to the question of how positive people are about the enlargement process, it is worth pointing out that opinion polls in several candidate states show that enthusiasm for accession to the EU is on the wane. Not in all countries but in several. That comes as no surprise, because a whole decade has passed since the historic turning point of 1989/1990, and there is still no comprehensive information and communication strategy for the people. Mr Verheugen said the same this afternoon. Now, all hopes and expectations are pinned on France. Above all, the Nice Summit must clarify whether, and how, the EU, for its part, can get itself completely ready for enlargement in good time. When the current Intergovernmental Conference finishes, institutional reform should create the necessary institutional conditions for an enlarged EU, i.e. for a Union comprising 25 Member States or more. It is absolutely essential for an enlarged European Union to be able to function effectively and have the capacity to act. Not only does the success of the French Presidency depend on it, the progress of the entire enlargement process is at stake for all concerned, including Poland.

 Mr President, it is customary for speakers to thank the rapporteur, but I want, today, to break this rule by thanking the petitioner, Mrs Louise McVay, for submitting this petition and thereby drawing attention not only to her own plight but also to the immense difficulties faced by MS sufferers in the EU, and the unequal treatment they receive. Even though the Commission’s initial response has nothing encouraging to say about this petition, I am very glad that the Committee on Petitions has taken the initiative in producing this report and, yet again, taken very seriously something that is of concern to the European public; I am convinced that Mrs Aaltonen’s report will prompt changes that will improve the quality of life for MS sufferers in the European Union. Just how urgently needed that is is demonstrated by the considerable qualitative differences between the responses by the health ministries of the Member States to treatments and therapies for people suffering from MS, which also show that sufferers from MS are not yet treated with the consideration that they urgently need. This report is an initial assessment, and the conclusions to which it comes are important ones, reflecting, among other things, the demands made by the German MS Association, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in November. I see it as being of the utmost importance that the needs of young people with MS should be considered and taken into account, as well as that those affected by it should be enabled, as far as possible and for as long as possible, to work and enjoy equal rights in the sphere of employment. Our rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen, herself demonstrates that, with the right therapy and treatment, people with MS can lead active lives in the world of work and in society at large. The Group of the Party of European Socialists, to which I belong, endorses all the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the report as a whole. The various tragic effects of the disease, which affect the lives of sufferers and their families, compel people with MS to engage in a lifelong struggle against a disease that is still incurable and whose progress is unpredictable. The EU must play a strategic role in improving equal access to therapies and treatments, by calling on the Member States to coordinate their actions, including in research, and by facilitating access to the best practice in treatment and rehabilitation. Sufferers from MS in the future Member States will benefit from this. (Sustained applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all three rapporteurs for their excellent work, but especially Mrs Laura González Álvarez, whom we miss greatly in the committee. The role of the Committee on Petitions is to ascertain whether national and local authorities are implementing and applying EU directives properly. We are therefore obliged constantly to enter into disputes with national governments or ministries, and sometimes the European Commission also launches infringement proceedings. Obviously this is not to the advantage of the government concerned, but we are here – and that is how I understand my work in the committee – to protect the public. These Lloyd's petitions are unpleasant, not only for the former and current British governments, but also for the European Commission, which hesitated as early as 1978 to take steps against the United Kingdom. The circumstances surrounding the exchange between the Commission and the British Government on Lloyd's were very curious. But just what is the so-called Lloyd's scandal? Lloyd's had recruited Names without making these people aware that it was facing huge insurance losses, mainly due to rulings in the USA on asbestos cases. The Lloyd's management then passed these losses on to the Names. As a result many lost their assets and some the only provision that they had made for their retirement. It was not only Britons that were affected but also Belgians and Germans. A few even took their own lives. Now we could say very coldly, 'Well, hard luck!' But no, these people were confident that the insurance market was regulated and that British and EU law would be respected. I am standing between two highly esteemed British colleagues, namely Roy Perry and Michael Cashman. I am very pleased that a compromise has been reached, but I also deeply regret the fact that this report has caused such a political upheaval. I welcome the compromise and hope that it will enable us to bring justice to the petitioners and help to ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on her report and to thank her. My group is of the opinion that the Commission communication is a step in the right direction, since it recognises how important the role of complainant is in the exposure of infringements of Community law. The Commission must welcome the citizen as the provider of a service, and must look after citizens’ interests. Only in this way is trust created, and the feeling conveyed that the EU is a Union for its citizens. The citizen must always be shown ways in which he can assert his rights as a citizen of the Union. This must also apply to the Commission even if it turns out that the Commission is for once not the right body to which to turn with a complaint. The citizen must have the feeling that this is what Europe is, and I say Europe because we must remember that many citizens do not make any distinction between the institutions. The citizen must therefore be given an answer. Therefore I particularly welcome the fact that this communication includes this aspect. I would have liked the wording to be more clear, however, in particular by stating that the Commission must in all cases show the complainant an alternative means of recourse to law. Citizens must be dealt with and informed individually and personally. The Commission must inform the complainant immediately and consistently. Here it is also important that the complainant really does have the opportunity to present his complaint to the Commission in person and to explain it in more detail. The good intentions of the communication must now be put into practice and must not be allowed to remain merely a theory on paper. Like the rapporteur, I too am basically of the opinion that the one-year time limit for processing complaints is sufficient. That means, however, that the one-year time limit must be the rule and that the citizen is able to rely on really obtaining an answer within one year. I do not believe the excuse that the Commission does not have enough staff in order to do this to be a valid one. Like Mrs Fourtou, I regret the fact that the communication did not make any connection with the petition procedure. For years the Committee on Petitions has been demanding intensified inter-institutional cooperation. This has already been referred to in the Perry-Keßler report.

 Mr President, thank you for the reply, but let me ask you this, briefly and succinctly: are you prepared to ensure, are you prepared to intervene, so that the thirteen persons – the delegation of human rights activists whose passports were confiscated in Casablanca – are given back their passports and are able to resume their journey to the 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva?

Madam President, this Dutch initiative is fundamentally to be welcomed. An initiative of this kind towards European cooperation in more effective prosecution of crime deserves support, especially when the crimes in question are as detestable as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. I aimed to keep the initiative on exchange of information among the contact points as simple as possible, something which the Germans and the Dutch supported in Council. That being so, I would have considered it right to refer, in Article 2(2) to the law on judicial assistance between Member States currently in force and laid down in bilateral and multilateral agreements. Whatever the rapporteur may think, such an agreement does indeed exist between all the Member States; it is the one that was adopted by the Council of Europe on 20 April 1959. Over and above that, there is a new judicial assistance agreement dated May 2000, which is adapted to more modern circumstances but has not yet been ratified by all the Member States. This new judicial assistance agreement would already represent a marked simplification, and would also make the creation of a new procedure superfluous. Now, the rapporteur was in agreement with the reference to the existing agreement, but was not willing to support the deletion of the procedure in Articles 3 to 6, which was to be newly introduced. As I did not want to risk the committee adopting such a contradictory report, I finally refrained from submitting the amendments I have referred to, but I still have serious misgivings. Equally, though, I would like to emphasise that I see the creation of a European network of contact points as extraordinarily important. I also hope that the success of this network and of this important initiative will not be impaired by procedural disputes. I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report.

Madam President, the Union treaty makes it our duty to create an area of freedom, security and justice for Europe's citizens. The Council proposal is an important step in this direction. Admittedly, it does nothing more than combine five already-existing programmes, but this combination creates homogeneity and clarity, which is particularly necessary in the difficult area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The combination of the programmes can now serve to prevent overlapping and close loopholes. The creation of a single framework programme will also further improve the uptake of financial resources. Only cross-border criminal prosecution and enforcement can combat contemporary criminality, for those who commit crimes are taking extensive advantage of the freedoms of the European Union. The EU's citizens will also feel their sense of security reinforced. They know that there are no no-go areas for the law in its pursuit of criminals. They will be pursued right across the EU, and in like manner. It is in this context that the amendment on the publication on the Internet of the results of the investigations and studies cofinanced under this programme is particularly to be welcomed. This is a further step towards the greater transparency that we need in order once again to bring the advantages of European cooperation to our citizens' attention. Greater protection for victims is especially to be highlighted and much to be welcomed. It is the victims who have most to endure, but who are far from receiving the best protection and care. It must therefore be ensured that effective protection of victims' interests in criminal proceedings can be guaranteed. It is particularly to be welcomed, in view of EU enlargement, that the Council proposal can take into account the candidate countries and involve them in projects. What cannot, however, be accepted is the way in which the Council proposal disregards Parliament; in particular, Parliament's sovereignty in budget matters makes it necessary for it at least to be informed concerning the progress of the programme and not to get a report only as late as 2005. The rapporteur should therefore be supported in his efforts to bring about an amendment on this point. I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate Mr Coelho on his report, in particular on his success in achieving, as was necessary, more precise use of language.

Mr President, I greatly welcome the ARGO action programme. It is my firm conviction that it is only through greater cooperation between the authorities of individual States that the existing discrepancies in the application of Community regulations can be removed. Proof that the inequality of treatment in the Member States has to be done away with is provided above all by the great number of petitions addressed to Parliament. In recent years there have been 468 petitions alone on the subject of inequality of treatment in this area. It really is time to do more about this issue. Another improvement in comparison with the present Odysseus programme is the explicit inclusion of the visa issue, another area that has seen the submission of numerous petitions. The electronic exchange of data is of particular importance to cooperation across Europe, and I call for the creation of a common database for the whole of Europe, a database that must be accessible to the competent authorities in the Member States – if need be, to third countries as well – and also to the competent agencies of the European institutions. In this context, the protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information must be safeguarded unconditionally and to the fullest extent. Alongside that, we must ensure that the authorities in the individual States provide information within an appropriate period of time when asked to do so by the Committee on Petitions. This obligation is the sole protection for the petitioner's legitimate expectations. Delays in passing on information, which have occurred up to now, cause petitioners unacceptable detriment, something which can, in my view, be prevented only by the Committee on Petitions being enabled, in cases of urgency, to bring negative conduct by the authorities to the public's notice. Bad publicity is no doubt something that every public body wants to avoid.

Mr President, common regulation of the conditions under which third-country nationals shall have the freedom to travel in the territory of the Member States, is much to be welcomed. During the Committee's deliberations, the fragmentary attempts at regulation, based on French and Portuguese initiatives, were repeatedly subjected to criticism. There was a demand for a more global approach to mobility in the Schengen area, a demand which has been met by this Commission proposal for a directive. On the one hand, the conditions under which third-country nationals have the freedom to travel for a maximum of three months are to be regulated and harmonised, thus complying with the obligation laid on the Council by the Treaty of Amsterdam to lay down these conditions within five years of the Treaty entering into force. On the other hand, a quite new instrument – that of the specific travel authorisation – is to be introduced, permitting the extension of freedom to travel to six months under certain special conditions. Let me say at the outset that I do not understand why a directive was chosen in preference to a regulation as the legal instrument in this instance. The text is framed in sufficiently definite terms. Since a directive needs to be transposed at national level, the application of the instrument is delayed for an unspecified period of time. This instrument, moreover, replaces, among others, Regulation 1091/2001, which has already entered into force. This, then, is another reason why a regulation would be the more appropriate legal instrument. There has been no essential change to the freedom to travel enjoyed by third-country nationals who are not required to have a visa and by holders of a longer-term residence permit. There is, though, a new regulation for those holders of the national visa issued by the Member States for longer-term residence who are not yet in possession of the residence permit. Contrary to the Commission's proposal, such third-country nationals should, in my judgment, continue to be permitted to travel on Member States' territory even before they apply for the residence permit. It would represent a retrograde step back to the legal situation under the Schengen Convention if freedom to travel were to be granted only once that application were made, and would be comprehensible to none of the parties affected. Moreover, there is no evident reason why this category of persons should be treated differently to, and worse than, other third-country nationals covered by the directive when it comes to the date on which their freedom to travel begins. Third-country nationals travelling with a national visa would, in any case, then have to fulfil the same conditions as those travelling with a standard Schengen visa. This is a result of putting the visas on an equal footing as regards unrestricted travel. It means that the consultation procedures between the Member States on the confidential lists 5A and 5B in the Consular Instructions must also apply to national visas. Those Member States with reservations about nationals of certain third countries would otherwise have no possibility of taking cognisance of them and monitoring them if national visas were issued by other Member States, resulting in a security loophole that the events of 11 September have made quite unacceptable. Although there was lively discussion on this point in Committee, an overwhelming majority of its members supported my proposal. This result confirms the Committee's strength, which lies in its ability to reach, in response to changed conditions, a new decision on a matter on which there has already been a vote.

Mr President, I congratulate Mr von Boetticher. I am speaking on the European judicial area in civil matters. When the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, judicial cooperation in civil matters was transferred from the third pillar to the first, since when the European Community has elaborated an ambitious work programme in that area. A detailed examination of the GROTIUS programme led to the conclusion that a new, more general, framework for activities in this field was needed. The new framework regulation makes it possible to continue the projects already financed by the GROTIUS programme. I thoroughly welcome this draft regulation by the Commission, which is intended to create a legal basis for the financing of judicial cooperation in civil matters by the EU Budget. For the first time, the framework regulation also makes possible financial support for European non-governmental organisations, provided that these function on a non-profit basis and that their objectives serve to promote judicial cooperation. It is greatly to be welcomed that acceding countries and third countries are able to participate in all these activities. The limitation, proposed by the rapporteur and adopted by the Committee, to one-third of the involved Member States, is realistic and far-sighted, especially against the backdrop of the imminent enlargement up to 2006. This regulation does not apply in Denmark, Ireland or the United Kingdom. Legal practitioners in these countries can, however, participate in the projects alongside their counterparts from the acceding countries and elsewhere. The concept of 'legal advisers' in this regulation has a quite different background from that in the directive on money laundering. For that reason definition by means of a concluding list, as proposed by the rapporteur, would in this case inhibit the flexible use of this regulation in the future and limit its scope. This is true, in particular, because it is difficult to translate correctly into all the Community languages without giving the terms for the relevant legal profession a different meaning, especially since individual Member States might in the future add other types of legal practitioner, who would then be barred from participation. I would therefore prefer it if there were no list of these occupations.

Mr President, immigration over recent decades, which is measurable in millions, has taken place largely despite the arrangements put in place by the Member States. In most cases, the hallmark of national policies on immigration is a lack of vision and creativity and a fear of domination by foreign influences. However, there is now no disputing that immigration has taken place on a substantial scale and that immigration will and must take place in future. The detailed reasons for this are to be found in the 28 pages of the Commission communication. The Commission's shift to an active immigration policy is very much to be welcomed. The Commission recognises that pressures to migrate will continue and that regulated immigration can be advantageous for the EU, for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin. This change in policy does, however, also mean that decisions will have to be taken and that it is not sufficient merely to administer immigration by hiding behind general political guidelines, or, in the words of the rapporteur, on the basis of the cornerstones of immigration policy. That would mean that we would never achieve a Community migration policy as laid down in the Tampere conclusions. Instead, immigration would remain a national responsibility for Member States, with all their shortcomings, with just a basic framework at Community level. Overall, a long-term immigration policy can reduce the pressure from illegal immigration, from trafficking in human beings, from illegal employment and from the economic exploitation of migrants. Third country nationals must be given the same rights as EU citizens, as the Commission assumes in its communication, and they should be able to contribute to the local economy through their work; only in this way will the sort of integration we want take place. (Applause)

Mr President, I shall do my best. This report is on the proposal for a Council decision on four programmes to do with cooperation and exchange in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. To recap: GROTIUS is a programme of cooperation between legal practitioners with a budget of EUR 8.8 million. OISIN is a programme of cooperation between law enforcement authorities with a budget of EUR 8 million. STOP is a programme to coordinate action to combat the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children with a budget of EUR 6.5 million and HIPPOCRATES is a new programme concerned mainly with training for the prevention of crime and is to be allocated a budget of EUR 2 million. Including HIPPOCRATES is a good idea insofar as fundamental aspects of the programme, such as its duration, access and funding rules, tally with the proposals in the other programmes. The Commission has proposed extending the GROTIUS, OISIN and STOP multi-annual programmes by a further two years. In principle, we should vote in favour of extending these programmes because they have proven to be conducive – even though not all the Member States take part in them – to effective cooperation in combating and preventing crime, thereby helping to implement the Tampere conclusions. The Commission’s implementation reports confirm that the programme objectives have been achieved. However, an external study has highlighted persistent weaknesses in the implementation of the three programmes, for example in connection with the management and dissemination of the project results. There is also some doubt as to whether the mobilisation of project agencies has been improved by reducing the cofinancing limit from 80% to 70%. I am in favour of including candidate countries in these programmes at the earliest possible opportunity, simply because the reform of the police and judiciary in these countries leaves a great deal to be desired. I should therefore like them involved at the earliest possible opportunity. The only real exception which I take to the Commission proposal concerns the time scale. I would have liked a single framework programme to have been submitted now. I am positive that, with greater commitment on the Commission’s part, this would have been feasible. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs would have liked a more comprehensive and ambitious programme from the Commission. There are reasons against continuing various funding programmes separately from one another. It is difficult to allocate a project to a specific funding programme if it relates to a general subject, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or to several technical areas at once or involves both Member States and candidate countries. Running individual programmes in parallel increases the probability of conflicting aims and makes it difficult to carry out a financial evaluation and check the coherence of individual programmes with the general objectives of the Union. It is also difficult for Parliament to keep track of the programmes. The fact that most funding is for third party projects begs the question of whether the institutions have no priorities of their own which require funding. I am thinking here, for example, of asylum seekers, of victims of crime or projects to improve infrastructure. In addition, a separate budget has been proposed for pilot projects. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs therefore proposes that plenary support the Commission proposals but, at the same time, calls on the Commission to present a proposal well before the end of 2001, consolidating all the initiatives designed to create an area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in order to strengthen citizens’ rights and fundamental rights. So much for this aspect. Now to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters. It was decided to set up a judicial network in criminal matters back in 1998. This network operates via national contact points which advise and support local authorities. Following teething troubles of a mainly technical and linguistic nature, the network now helps considerably in simplifying cross-border investigations into criminal offences. The Commission proposal suggests extending the method of cooperation between national contact points to civil and commercial matters, a measure long overdue in my view. I welcome this project as an opportunity to simplify judicial cooperation between Member States and, more importantly, to facilitate cross-border legal procedures. The activities of the network should, in the final analysis, benefit the citizens; improving judicial cooperation is merely a half-way objective, the final objective being to create an area of justice for our citizens, which is why the Committee’s proposed amendments specify that citizens should be able to take recourse to the courts and authorities in any Member State as easily as they can in their own, thereby incorporating in the proposal the objective formulated by the European Council in the Tampere milestones. The basic objective should be to guarantee proper access to the law and fast, reliable procedures. I also see this network as an accompanying instrument for the purpose of implementing the Brussels II Convention. In order to learn from the experience of the judicial network in criminal matters, the new network needs to cooperate closely with the contact points of the judicial network in criminal matters. It would also be a good idea if the secure electronic information exchange system to be set up were based on the current administrative electronic data exchange programme. Here again, I would stress that candidate countries should be included at the earliest possible opportunity. A central, electronic EU index of legal cases and a data bank containing a register of judgments would be invaluable to courts and persons taking recourse to the law. A detailed proposal on this has already been submitted. I am grateful for the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis, which helped to clarify the text, and I am grateful for the support for my amendments in committee. I cannot support Amendment No 8 limiting the number of participants and agree with the Commission here. Nor was anyone able to convince me of the merit of Amendment No 13 on a pilot project within this network.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I support the analysis, conclusions and considerations presented by the rapporteur, and I also share his concern about the problems highlighted by the Multidisciplinary Group. I thank Mr Ferri for his work. In the EU there are 15 different penal codes, a large number of police forces, some of them competing with each other, and 15 legal systems, all deeply marked by their own mentality, tradition and culture. Until the EU’s criminal law systems are harmonised – something which is to be desired – judicial cooperation will continue to operate through a complex and antiquated system of requests for legal assistance, an emotive term for almost all public prosecutors and judges. But European cooperation is more urgent than ever. For example, 77% of all cases of organised crime in Germany in 1998 had an international connection. There is a great need for the Council to act. In Luxembourg, for example, the Minister of Justice must give his personal authorisation whenever the banking sector is involved. The Netherlands use their own classification of urgency instead of adopting the urgency of the requesting State. The five countries have insufficient staff and inadequate technical and financial resources for dealing with requests for legal assistance. On the positive side, we can mention the Netherlands’ KRIS programme, the Irish system and Denmark’s experience with the Nordic countries. Where contact points exist within the Judicial Network, there is good experience and results, but the network has no influence over formal requests for legal assistance. The creation of contact points alone is still no guarantee of the qualitative leap needed in European cooperation. At some contact points, the willingness to make regular exchanges also left much to be desired. If the Council is serious about successfully fighting cross-border crime, which simply disregards democracy and the rules of the legal economy, the recommendations of the rapporteur and the committee must be translated into action. I do not want to go over the details of what Mr Ferri has already said, but it does mean that the candidate countries need to be fully involved in the strategy for fighting organised crime at an early stage. The Judicial Network must be further expanded, for example with internet pages about the various legal systems, with videoconferencing facilities and, finally, Eurojust should become a meaningful adjunct to EUROPOL and OLAF.

 Mr President, I welcome the fact that an action plan has been drawn up for Albania and I also welcome my colleague's – Mrs Karamanou's – committed report. On the basis of her analysis of the political and economic situation in Albania, it is possible for us to reach a better understanding of the causes of the migratory movements and to develop corresponding measures. I do regret, however, the fact that this action plan, and also the other action plans which have been drawn up, are characterised above all by measures aimed at control and repression. Albania is one of the poorest countries in the world and has itself taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees. At present, there is a heavy stream of refugees returning which the lack of security, law and order is actually impeding. Some of the people being sent back have integrated well. Young people are having to interrupt their training and are facing an uncertain future. This is an ill-advised policy. The reintegration of the refugees must therefore take place under safe and humane conditions. For this to be the case, it is absolutely essential to draw up plans for a coordinated repatriation operation and, above all, to involve non-governmental and international organisations. I still judge the situation in Albania to be very serious because of the political instability, the disregard for laws and the extremely high levels of crime. Year after year, especially in summer, thousands of people risk their lives on their way to the EU. In so doing, hundreds of these refugees die at sea. We will never know the true death toll. Italy's 7 000-kilometre-long coastal border is difficult to police and offers gangs of traffickers, who proceed with remarkable contempt for human life, huge scope for their activities. Criminals, who exploit the refugees' affliction, must be punished. The toughest possible action needs to be taken against trafficking in human beings – in particular in small children – and the exploitation of people for illicit work and prostitution. But anyone who thinks that controlling the traffickers alone would contribute to stopping illegal immigration is mistaken. We need to step up the dialogue between the various negotiating and advisory forums and we need better coordination. Only in this way can we together contribute to combating the exploitation of refugees by traffickers. The Community must support Albania in its efforts to strengthen the rule of law, and also, particularly where financial support is concerned – I should like to stress this – we must not leave Albania and the region to fend for themselves. Finally, I would take this opportunity to call on the Council once again to take steps to bring the policy on immigration, asylum and combating trafficking in human beings entirely within the Community system.

Mr President, the right to petition and to complain is not some recent invention. Even 2000 years ago petitioners could put their concerns before the Roman emperor. But this right was always in danger of being changed, restricted or abolished. Yesterday’s petitioners have become today’s responsible European citizens. No administration or institution is infallible. Many petitions point to a discrepancy between the legal provisions and European integration. So petitions are a gauge for the relations between the citizens and the legislator and there are many levels of petitions. A population of hamsters in an industrial area is of just as much concern to us as the ban on silicon implants or the introduction of a heavy goods tax. I turn now to the Ombudsman. My group congratulates the Ombudsman on the work he accomplished in 1999. It was, and is, to Mr Söderman’s credit that he has done so much to create greater transparency and openness within the European administrations. Since most of the complaints in the Ombudsman’s remit relate to the European Commission and concern a lack of transparency, work needs to be done to improve this situation. That includes access to documents, not only for the citizens of Europe but also for the Ombudsman. New office technologies cannot be used as grounds for the lack of transparency either. Comprehensible, substantiated replies to the citizens create trust, the opposite gives rise to distrust and a rising number of complaints that need to be dealt with, which therefore in turn creates costs. The Ombudsman’s proposal for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour is particularly welcome. The citizens have a basic right to an open and responsible administration geared to providing services, since after all it is paid for out of their taxes. In my view it is most important for the European Ombudsman to play an independent role, which can serve as an example for the introduction of national ombudsmen in the candidate countries and in my Land
 of Thüringen.

 Madam President, in my opinion perversion is undoubtedly on the increase if, in addition to a child being sexually exploited, the event is recorded, in whatever fashion, and then reused for financial gain. These events are occurring every day, every hour and perhaps every minute. The perpetrators are using the most up-to-date technology to distribute their material and in the Internet they have found a medium which is more suited than any other to acting anonymously. Paedophiles are limited only by their own technical capability or the equipment which they can afford. When seen against its virtually unlimited potential, society and the state have thus far had very little at their disposal to counter illegal activity on the Internet, in particular since cyberspace has no states or geographical and political borders and its alluring feature is its worldwide accessibility. The Internet itself cannot commit crimes. What is criminal is the behaviour of some 3 to 5% of Internet users who misuse the Net for illegal purposes. 95 to 97% of the Internet is legal. The Internet is therefore a reflection of society as a whole. Just as in the real world, crime is very much a part of the virtual world. All the same, the Internet is not beyond the law. The problem of crime on the Internet cannot be resolved by any state in isolation. For this we need uniform worldwide crimes and definitions so that law enforcement authorities can work together in global terms and not in opposition. In the area of child pornography in particular, where the rights of children are continually being trampled underfoot, there is an urgent need for global regulation. The EU has already taken several measures towards this, which I will not go into any further here. I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report. It is a high-quality text. Nevertheless, to effectively combat child pornography, it is necessary, in my opinion, for Europol to be immediately informed of cases of child pornography and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly, as stated in Amendment No 20 from Gerhard Schmid. All the proposed measures are suitable and necessary to effectively combat child pornography. However, we must not forget that, in addition to the technological and police measures, we must also combat poverty, ignorance and prejudice in order to improve society’s image of children and children’s image of themselves and to offer help to the victims; thus far, victim support has played too insignificant a role. We need a social climate in which the victims of vile crimes are not left to fend for themselves whilst the perpetrators are shielded through failure to act and fear of embarrassing revelations. (Applause)

 Mr President, my Group welcomes this proposal. It is important that this instrument should remain in force for the entire five-year period and that the core elements of a common asylum system should be codified within this period. The Fund should help to balance up the differences between Member States in the acceptance and integration of persons in need of protection. A precondition for this is that the various factors must be given due consideration in allocating the money. It is necessary that the legal basis for the Fund should be adopted as soon as possible so as to ensure continuous EU financing of refugee projects. I welcome the fact that, under Article 5, the money for routine projects is to be separated from emergency aid measures. Mass refugee situations require special measures and separate budgetary allocations. Only in this way can routine long-term measures also be maintained. The effective distribution of responsibilities which the Fund is striving for can only be achieved in the long term if the existing problems of widely divergent capacities are tackled. This requires additional support for the Member States with a less well established asylum system. I therefore consider that a fixed sum for the Member States which are experiencing difficulties in establishing their asylum system is advisable. The description in Article 3 of the tasks and measures which are worthy of promotion could lead to a priori
 support for measures to improve the acceptance conditions for asylum seekers, but this should not mean that measures necessary for fairer and more effective asylum procedures are neglected. I am of the opinion that the Fund should finance measures to inform the public concerning the policy and practice of the Member States with regard to refugees, asylum seekers and other temporarily protected persons. The positive results of such activities in the past speak in favour of the continuation of such financial support, which should be made available to every eligible applicant. I congratulate Mrs Frahm on her excellent report and gladly support the request of Mrs Frahm and Mrs Buitenweg for the addition of this sum to the Refugee Fund.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May. We always hoped that the accession process could serve as a catalyst to end the division of Cyprus. In three days' time, the Cypriots themselves must decide whether they wish to live in a unified state after almost 30 years of division, and whether after almost 30 years, they wish to join the European Union as a unified state. Since the Green Line was opened for Cypriots on 23 April last year, we have seen very clearly that Cypriots from both communities are willing and able to coexist peacefully. The Annan Plan which will be voted on by both communities on 24 April is a compromise between the wishes and legitimate demands of both sides. The plan may not be totally balanced; perhaps it does have weaknesses as regards the power of central government, and perhaps the guarantees for the implementation of individual measures are not clear enough. Are these doubts really a reason to reject the plan? Are the undoubted weaknesses an adequate reason to reject the opportunities that the proposal offers? My twenty years of experience in working towards a solution for Cyprus, for its accession and for unity, tell me that the opportunities far outweigh the risks. We are not the ones who have to decide on 24 April. Even if we hope for a positive outcome, we will accept the democratic decision of the people of Cyprus. What the European Parliament can say with certainty, however, is that this year is 2004, not 1964 or 1974. A united Cyprus will become a Member State of the European Union, and as a Member State, it will not only enjoy the full protection afforded by membership. It will also see that the responsibility of the European Union as a whole for ensuring the successful implementation of the Annan Plan guarantees this opportunity for peaceful coexistence. Today, the European Parliament will commit itself to monitoring the entire implementation process through its committee work. We are currently witnessing many fears, especially on the part of Greek Cypriots who look back at the past. However, looking forward to the future is the better option. Turkey in 2004 is a country with a European perspective. It is no longer the Turkey of 1974. The Turkish Cypriots showed back in December that they have largely thrown off the legacy of Rauf Denktash. New opportunities are unlikely to present themselves soon. The only alternative to the plan is the ongoing and entrenched division of the island. This plan offers an opportunity and should not be gambled away due to false or inadequate information. As Members of the European Parliament, we are today sending a message to our soon-to-be fellow citizens in the European Union. Statements by a European Commissioner, by the European Parliament or by individual Members do not constitute interference in Cyprus's domestic affairs or pressure from outside. They are well-intentioned advice. They are information which is being passed around within the family in which we must shape Europe's future from 1 May. I hope that accession day on 1 May will be a genuine celebration of reunification in Cyprus – the unification of all Cypriots with almost 450 million people in the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Conference for Renewable Energies is to be held in Bonn at the beginning of June. The German Federal Chancellor had announced this conference at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. I regard this conference as a truly important result of this summit, as you yourself, Commissioner, have just said. I do think that it was particularly those who had been in Johannesburg who were extremely disappointed by what came out of it with regard to renewable energies. Even if, as you just said, we can now welcome the Johannesburg coalition’s first successes, it had not been possible to achieve the goals we had set ourselves there at the time, even though the European Union really did make very serious and very concerted efforts. As I see it, this makes it extraordinarily important that this conference in Bonn should be a success. You referred, Commissioner, to the European preparatory conference in Berlin, which was held in January, attended by over 650 participants from 45 countries, and made its expectations very clear – not only as regards what it expected of the Bonn conference, but also of the European Union and its policies. I think the way in which the European Union has conceived its strategy for the development of renewable energies has been positively exemplary, envisaging the doubling of the share of energy production from renewable sources to 12% – in the case of the electricity sector to 22.1% – by 2010. You mentioned our market penetration campaign and our legislation to promote electricity and biofuels. It is important to note that we are currently engaged in using the eco-design directive and energy services to build up efficiency, but what is now vital is that we press on with this strategy and step it up. I do not actually need to remind you what this is about – the climate change problem, finite resources, the need to reduce our dependence on imports, the creation of jobs in this area. I think it is, in the first place, important that we should look beyond 2010 and – although this is where I disagree with you, Commissioner – to set ourselves a new objective. The fact is that the Berlin conference did not merely call for a study; it also made it quite plain in its concluding resolutions that 20% was a desirable target for 2020, and you can see that our compromise resolution expects no less than that, namely that the Commission and the Council should have that as their goal and that policies should be framed with it in mind. What will in future be important in terms of a more intensive approach will be the devising of new measures to this end. Although you have expressed doubts about this, we can see that it is, under certain circumstances, possible to achieve the 22.1% we have set ourselves in the electricity sector; we learn this in particular from the countries with a system of central dispatch. It is impossible, or almost impossible, to achieve this in heating and refrigeration, so this is where it will be important to add to EU lawmaking if the overall target of doubling is to be achieved, but also to integrate renewable energies in many of the European Union’s other policy areas, such as structural policy, regional policy, perhaps in the Mediterranean and certainly in development cooperation. We know that three billion people around the world are obliged to live without access to electricity, and it is quite crucial in terms of the poverty reduction that we should back something that offers real opportunities of doing this, that being decentralised systems using renewable energies. It is for that reason that our resolution makes it very clear that it is necessary to provide for the appropriate measures, and that means that institutions providing funding – such as, among others, the European Investment Bank – must give priority to renewable energies and to energy efficiency.

 Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is the last time that this House will be able to discuss the process by which the ten new Member States are acceding to the European Union. There remain only 51 days before the historic date of 1 May 2004, on which the European Union will grow to become a Union of 25 Member States. This particular enlargement of the European Union will be accomplished on Workers’ Day, a date symbolising our need to face up to the challenge of giving the Union of 25 states economic and social cohesion. It is no less significant that, the internal policy of the enlarged Europe being a work of peace, we are developing it into a real, outward-looking common European peace policy. I have made Cyprus my concern ever since I entered this House in 1984, a time when few thought its accession a realistic prospect. Then, a few years later, Parliament forcefully urged that a solution to the Cyprus problem should not be made a precondition for its accession. I well remember such former Members of this House as Mrs Pauline Green, Mr Jan Willem Bertens, and Mr Yannos Kranindiotis; we believed that the accession process would be the catalyst that would bring about unification. There is now a substantial chance of the 30-year-long division of Cyprus being brought to an end even before 1 May. Not merely is it to be hoped, it is also to be expected, that the negotiating parties will indeed seize this opportunity, which may well be the last for a long time, and I hope and trust that Turkey will stand by its recent indications of willingness to work towards a solution. We must bring about a united Cyprus, in which all Cypriots can live together in peace, and which can play a full part as a Member State of the EU.

Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, first of all I would like to express my appreciation for the great work that has been carried out. Having said that, I have a specific question relating to Cyprus and Turkey. I greatly welcome the clarification in the progress report of the fact that the non-resolution of the Cyprus issue is an obstacle. I think that it is also extremely difficult to imagine beginning negotiations with a country that is, at the same time – as will be the situation under international law from May next year – occupying part of the EU territory. This leads me to ask a specific question: at present Turkish citizens in their masses are being given passports for the illegal North Cypriot state, which is intended, on the one hand, to change the demographic situation and, on the other, to prevent an opposition victory. That is the current situation. Even if we do not recognise this election, we know that the result will greatly influence what happens next. I think that it will also be extremely important for Turkey. My specific question to you is, therefore: do you think that it is possible to influence Turkey in this area and to make it clear that we want to put an end to this?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, for tabling a really good report and for the excellent cooperation. I think that here too, on the issue of biofuels, Parliament is continuing to honour its cross-party commitment to promote renewable energies. It is good to know that in our efforts to do so we can usually count on the Commission's support. I have serious doubts, however – and that is putting it mildly – as to whether the Council feels the same commitment as does Parliament to our joint target of doubling the proportion of renewable energies in the total energy consumed by 2010. At the first reading, Parliament came out in favour of binding targets for increasing the use of biofuels. As with the directive on promoting electricity generation from renewable energy sources, this did not stand a chance in the Council. We have therefore agreed, as we did for the electricity directive, to indirect targets, with the option of moving to mandatory targets at a later stage if the actual rate of increase falls significantly short of the target set. The Council's intention to give the Member States a whole series of opportunities for setting their national targets at levels which diverge from the prescribed 5.75% by 2010 is unacceptable. I very much hope that the Commission will scrutinise the reasons for departing from the indicative targets, which the Member States will have to provide, in a really very critical light. Despite this critical assessment of the Council position, I can say on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that we will grit our teeth and vote in favour of the compromises contained in the Council position. Why? We want a shift towards renewable energies to be promoted in the fuel sector too so as to make a positive contribution to the necessary minimising of CO2 emissions, to reduce our dependence on oil and to give a boost to development in rural areas. To achieve this it is not only targets that we need; it is also crucial that the Member States should be able to give tax breaks to biofuels. At the moment – and I will be quite open about this – this is our only possible course of action because the Council actually has our backs up against a wall. If the promotion directive does not go through the codecision procedure in the form that the Council wishes, then the tax directive – this has been made clear to us – will not be adopted. I very much hope that the new European constitution will make such a situation impossible in the future. Despite the shortcomings that I have identified, I hope and indeed I am confident that this directive, together with the tax breaks, really will give a further boost to increasing the use of biofuels.

Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to withdraw our support for Amendments Nos 68 and 69. This was a joint motion by the rapporteur and myself on behalf of our respective groups, which we tabled out of a desire to be accommodating to the Council, which wanted an immediate resolution, albeit one contrary to the line taken by the Committee. The Council, however, did nothing to meet us halfway, and my understanding of the codecision procedure is not that it involves conceding negotiating points at first reading stage without getting anything in return. We will be voting against both amendments. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome both the Commission's initiatives on biofuels. Plans to apply reduced rates of excise duty to biofuels or to exempt them from duties altogether, and to provide for the promotion of their use with a catalogue of clear objectives, will help to reduce the European Union's high degree of dependency on oil imports in an environmentally sound manner. From here on in, though, I propose to confine myself to the proposal on the promotion of biofuels. My heartfelt thanks go primarily to our rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, not only for submitting an excellent draft report, but also for her really good cooperation. The promotion of biofuels fits into the EU's overall strategy of doubling the penetration of renewable energy sources 
by 2010, a strategy for which we have essential reasons. In Kyoto, the EU made the commitment to reduce the output of greenhouse gases by 8%. Traffic in particular is a major source of these. It is likewise important to safeguard security of supply, and promoting the biomass as a source of energy will give rural development new and significant impetus. Speaking as I do for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I therefore welcome the responsible Committee's confirmation of the line taken by the Commission, that binding national targets should be set for further increasing the share of biofuels. I have, however joined with the rapporteur in tabling a compromise amendment providing for indicative targets to be linked with the possibility of their being reviewed. The rapporteur has gone into the background to this. The one thing we now see as important is that we should meet the Council halfway by being willing to set indicative targets as well, but this means that we expect the Council, this very week, to accede to the demands made by the competent Committee in various areas. It is important in this context that environmental and climatic conditions should come under particular scrutiny, that agricultural practices should be examined accordingly, and that it is not in the least acceptable for the Council to do as it is no doubt currently trying to do, and provide for any Member State to be able to opt out without substantial obstacles being put in the way of their doing so. What are we to do with a directive that starts by setting targets and then makes them more lenient? We are, then, prepared to come to a speedy agreement – indeed, the whole point is that we desire one – but such an agreement is not to be had at any price. We hope to have reached agreement with the Council by Thursday.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the verge of a really historic round of accessions. The European House can and will be extended eastwards. At the same time, a further southwards expansion will enrich the European Union with two beautiful and culturally valuable island states, Malta and Cyprus. It will not surprise you, however, if I now discuss one of these two states, namely Cyprus. Cyprus is the candidate country that has made the most progress in adapting to the acquis communautaire. That has already been pointed out. We can therefore safely assume that Cyprus will be included in the first round of accessions and that the next European elections will also take place in Cyprus. The question is: will all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike, be able to take part in those elections? In other words, will the division of the island, which is contrary to international law, be overcome prior to accession? We want it to be. We hope it will be. It really is time that Europe’s last divided capital at last became a living capital again and that Cypriots of both ethnic groups could live together in Cyprus in peace. I very much hope, as the President-in-Office of the Council has also made clear, that a political solution will be found by October at the latest. The fact that direct negotiations are now taking place for the first time in many years shows that the accession process is having the catalytic effect we hoped for. I also hope that Turkey, which is also a candidate country, understands that a solution for Cyprus is very much in Turkey’s interest and that Denktash cannot insist on a two state model. It is in Europe’s as well as Cyprus’ interest that the solution should result in a state that is capable of acting and taking decisions at international and European level. Cyprus must speak with one voice. If such a solution is not achieved by October, then we must try to ensure that Cyprus’ accession or membership acts as a catalyst for a solution, because the overwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots want to belong to the European Union and they also want to be able to live in a free Cyprus after accession.

 Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the floor briefly. To avoid there being any confusion, I should like to clarify just very briefly that – with the exception of Amendments Nos 2 and 4 – Amendments Nos 1 to 11 already represent compromises which were struck with the Council even before the second reading, within a kind of informal conciliation procedure. I should really like to urge you to vote in favour of these amendments because I believe that we have succeeded in improving the common position considerably.
Rothe (PSE

rapporteur. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the President just explained, this is the second reading of the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. There is a legitimate hope that the first European legislation on renewable energy will soon come into force. This European legislation will help to increase the share of renewables in the electricity market. I am firmly convinced of that. The directive will help us, the EU, to achieve our voluntary target of doubling the share of renewables by 2010. It will make an important contribution to innovation in electricity generated from wind, solar, hydro and biomass. In this way, the EU will demonstrate that it is willing to shoulder its responsibility for climate protection and a sustainable energy supply. Just a few weeks ago I would not have made these statements in this way, as the Council common position differed from Parliament's position on some key points and the Council was initially showing little willingness to change its position. However, tomorrow you will be voting on the result of an intensive and productive negotiating process. There are 10 compromises worked out with the Council in an informal conciliation process on Amendments Nos 1 to 11, but without Amendments Nos 2 and 4. This demonstrates that the Council and Parliament have really moved closer together in this regard. At this point I would like to very sincerely thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups, in particular Mrs Ayuso González and Claude Turmes. They have devoted a lot of time and energy to this process and have demonstrated a willingness both to fight and to compromise. I also owe an equal debt of gratitude to the Swedish presidency, which successfully endeavoured to shift the Council closer to Parliament's position. Last but by no means least I would like to thank the responsible Commission officials who played a very important moderating role in the negotiating process. As is generally the case with compromises, we can perhaps be satisfied, if not exactly enthusiastic, about the outcome achieved. I regret that we have not been able to set any binding national targets. Even more importantly, I regard the definition of renewable energy sources before us as quite simply wrong. In order to make it easier to achieve the targets, some Member States have insisted on including the biodegradable component of household waste in non-separated refuse incineration. This not only runs counter to Europe's objectives for waste avoidance and treatment, but it also gives the wrong message and discourages greater use of genuine renewable energy sources. I nevertheless request that you vote for the compromises reached with the Council. On the one hand, the directive will, by virtue of the amendments secured by Parliament, lead to a significant increase in the use of renewables. On the other hand, I am firmly convinced that it would not have been possible to achieve anything further, even in the conciliation process. Now let me turn to the key positive results. First of all, the Member States will have to gear their incentive measures to indicative national targets. If it becomes clear that the overall EU target – doubling the share of renewables – cannot be achieved, then the Commission can make proposals for mandatory targets. Second, before proposing any harmonised support scheme, the Commission will have to report on the success of the various national systems in achieving an increase in the market share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. Third, once any harmonised scheme comes into force, investor confidence regarding investments already made must be guaranteed. Fourth, access to the grid for electricity from renewable energy sources is guaranteed. This should not be jeopardised because of feed-in or transmission charges. Finally, proof of origin of electricity generated from renewables will guarantee transparency for the public. We have enormous potential for renewable energy sources here in Europe. We must exploit this potential in order to discharge our responsibility for sustainable development. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us, as we have just heard, is about promoting electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. This is therefore the first legislative procedure in the field of renewable energy. Commissioner, I would like to express my appreciation to you and your colleagues in the Commission for presenting this legislative proposal. The proposal for a directive is a logical consequence of the European Union's strategy to double the share of renewables in energy consumption by 2010. As you will see from the committee's report, we agree with the strategy presented in the proposal, which is not to undertake any European harmonisation of support schemes for the time being, but rather to let Member States decide upon support schemes on the basis of nationally set targets and objectives. However, the fact that we accept this strategy does not necessary mean that we accept all the detail. I believe that the committee's report proposes important and essential amendments to the proposed directive. First, however, I would like to make some preliminary comments about promoting renewables. Many people think that this smacks of subsidies, aids, and financial support for development. In reality, however, support schemes for electricity generation from solar, wind and biomass, for example, are only necessary because at present we are still directly or indirectly subsidising other energy sources, subsidies, which in the energy sector in the past, chiefly benefited pollutant fossil fuels or hazardous nuclear energy, and which continue to be to paid to them to some extent. Such subsidies distort competition. This means that promoting renewables compensates for the external costs of other energy sources, takes into account the positive environmental effects of this type of energy production and, at the same, time makes up for existing distortions in competition. As long as the external costs of fossil fuels and nuclear energy are not internalised, and as long as other energy sources are subsidised, compensation schemes will be needed for renewables. In the Commission's proposal and draft report, it is proposing indicative targets for the Member States. Binding individual targets for Member States are only envisaged if the interim reports indicate that compliance with the targets is not meeting the European Union's overall strategy. But we do not have that much time! We need binding targets right now. The European Union and all the Member States entered into commitments at Kyoto because they recognised the dramatic nature of climate change. In The Hague, the western industrialised nations are currently again being pilloried because they are only implementing those commitments half-heartedly. There is no doubt that renewables can make a vital contribution to meeting the binding reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions agreed in Kyoto. If the commitments entered into were meant seriously, then why not also a commitment to mechanisms which would help to meet those commitments, as I, with the support of the committee, have, after all, built a bridge for the Council and the Member States? These binding national targets are to be worked out within one year, with the assistance of experts from the Member States. This makes it possible for Member States to determine the exact level of their respective contributions to meeting the EU's target, in accordance with the principles of burden sharing, and, in this area, also the sharing of opportunities. A second important amendment we wish to see is this: the Commission envisages various different targets coexisting over five years. If we define a clear, binding framework for the Member States, then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements. A 10-year period would put us in a very good position to judge which system is the most successful and efficient. We want to convince people in Europe to switch to energy sources which nature renews afresh every day, which do not entail any environmental disruption or climate change, and which make a positive contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. So there should not really be any controversy about which types of energy production we mean and define as renewable. We do not therefore seriously want to have to tell the population of our respective regions that domestic waste, which nowadays contains an excessively high proportion of plastic waste, is regarded as a renewable energy source. Would we perhaps then have to call on the public to produce more and more of this waste, which would certainly enable us to meet the targets we have set ourselves? It goes without saying that this would discredit us and the European Union's policy. I am not against waste incineration, indeed I have even called for a separate directive on this in my report. No, what I am opposed to, as is the committee, is playing with words in a piece of legislation. As you can see, the draft report refers to separated organic municipal waste, because it belongs there. As you can also see, untreated wood and cork waste is regarded as a renewable energy source. Even if only hydroelectric installations with a capacity below 10 MW are to be covered by the support schemes, all hydro will, of course, be regarded as a renewable energy source and will count towards achieving the target. And one more thing I want to make crystal clear: waste incineration is not a renewable energy source and cannot therefore be counted towards meeting the targets. Another vital point that the committee agreed on was the problem of connection to the grid and access to the grid for renewables. There is no argument about the Commission's proposal to guarantee renewables priority access to the grid. I think that we are unanimous about that. The Commission's general text on the issue of cost sharing in the report makes matters substantially clearer. This is necessary because we can only create legal certainty and avoid disputes through clarification. Those are the main points I wanted to mention today. I hope that tomorrow this House will take a step forward on the basis of this proposed legislation and our opinion on it, and that you will be able to state, on behalf of the Commission, that you can accept our amendments and that the Council will then be next in line to do its bit! (Applause)

 Mr President, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the Council Presidency, to the acting President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Seixas da Costa, and to Commissioner Verheugen, for their statements on Cyprus. I welcome with open arms the fact that both underlined the European Union’s desire to try harder to resolve the Cyprus question.   For we all know that it is unacceptable that this island has been divided since 1974 and that approximately 38% of Cyprus has been occupied by Turkey for more than 26 years. In the past, any attempt to resolve the Cyprus question by peaceful means foundered on the entrenched attitude of the Turkish side, the Turkish Cypriot leadership that is. But as you yourself made clear, we have just entered the year 2000 and may find that we are facing a new situation, possibly with new opportunities. First of all there are the United Nations’ new activities, which have already been mentioned, then there are the new activities to be undertaken by the US government, and there is clear rapprochement between Turkey and Greece. In particular, however, as I see it, we ought to be able to expect a breakthrough following the Council decisions taken in Helsinki. The Union admitted Turkey to the circle of applicant countries in Helsinki. At the same time, it was decided that the accession of Cyprus to the Union would not be made conditional on the resolution of the Cyprus question, which, as Mr Poos said, was actually already the clear position of the Union and also Parliament, and this was confirmed in various resolutions. Therefore, Helsinki has left Turkey in no doubt whatsoever as to the fact that it has no right of veto regarding the accession of Cyprus, and that the further deepening of its relations with the European Union are closely bound up with the resolution of the Cyprus question. It is therefore very much to be hoped that smart politicians in Ankara will recognise the opportunities that ending the Turkish occupation of Cyprus would also bring for Turkey itself. I sincerely hope that– as someone here said – this window of opportunity will be opened very wide indeed and that representatives of the Council and of the Commission will continue to work to this end with the Turkish government. Unlike Mrs Frassoni, I do not believe that the Cyprus question is just about different communities of people, rather it is quite fundamentally about Turkish politics. I think we can assume that, where Cyprus is concerned, the EU accession process is irreversible. And we all hope that it will be a united Cyprus that joins. Hence another request for clarification from you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: you have spoken of involvement on the Turkish Cypriot side. Has there been any indication that the Turkish Cypriot side intends to accept the offer made by the Cypriot government or by the European Commission, or that it intends to take up this offer to join the talks?   Secondly, I welcome with open arms the fact that this week, on the basis of the Brok report – and thank you very much for this report, Mr Brok – we also intend to concern ourselves with the financial aspects of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta. For it is absolutely crucial that, when the financial protocols with Cyprus and Malta expire, we make financial aid available for countries to adapt to the acquis communautaire
. Both countries are very far from being the poorest of the applicant countries. Nevertheless, it is in fact crucial for Malta and Cyprus to make headway on the adaptation front. Cyprus expects to have to spend around EUR 850 million – which corresponds to almost 12% of their own GNP – on adaptation activities between 1999 and 2002. Consequently, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has pronounced itself in favour of increasing the EUR 95 million that has been set aside. And I very much hope that we will genuinely have opportunities to increase this amount.   As for the Cypriots, Greek as well as Turkish Cypriots, it is to be hoped that we will be able to pour considerable resources into the planned measures for bicommunal cooperation that Commissioner Verheugen mentioned earlier, so as to achieve the goal of bringing the two ethnic communities together again. My final question to Commissioner Verheugen is as follows: has there been any sign that there is more chance now of bicommunal contact being established on Cyprus than there was at the time of Luxembourg? There was no chance whatsoever of it happening at that time because Denkta� vetoed it.

 Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme. Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee. However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout. Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament’s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and – as has already been mentioned – we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community. This is not satisfactory – I would like to make that quite clear. However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed. For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption. This is the European Union’s declared aim. That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role. In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples. To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan. We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission’s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy. It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors. It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it. The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion. 75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions. In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.

 Mr President, I should first of all like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for presenting a really good report. We in the Committee have gone along to the greatest possible degree – in fact, unanimously – with the proposal to again take up important requests for changes which arose out of the first reading and which have not been taken into account by the Council although we were very happy – and I say this here too, Mr Langen – that extensive approaches to Parliament were made.  It is a declared goal of the European Union to double the proportion of renewable sources of energy consumed by the year 2010. Parliament and the Commission were already in agreement on this in the debate on the Green and White Papers. The Council too has supported their stance in the common position we have before us. Although it is clear that the technical potential available from wind power and solar energy, from biomass, from water power and from geothermal energy could cover considerably more than 12% of energy consumption by 2010, we know that achieving just this 12% will require great efforts, judging by growth rates in the past.  This means that the Member States must do their homework. It also means that the European Union must make greater headway than in the past. For this to happen, it is necessary, on the one hand, to facilitate fair access to the grid for electricity from renewable energy sources. I would point out to the Commissioner that Parliament awaits the relevant proposals which must be such as to contribute to real market penetration. The close connection between conditions of access to the grid and growth rates in the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources is something we can see from the above-average rates of increase in Denmark, Germany and also Spain.  But what we are concerned with today is the ALTENER programme. It is the only EU programme which alone has the promotion of renewable energy sources as its goal. This programme is also the main instrument for implementing the Community strategy for renewable energy sources and it is therefore also the main instrument of the breakthrough campaign for renewable sources of energy. By means of this campaign, we want to introduce photovoltaic systems with a maximum output of one million kilowatts within the European Union and in developing countries. Among other things, 15 million square metres of solar collectors are to be erected. 10,000 megawatts are to be obtained from wind power and a further 10,000 megawatts from biomass. This campaign has to be financed from resources of the Member States, privately and with European funds.  The Commission had earmarked the amount of EUR 81.1 million for the four-year period from 1998 to 2002 in the ALTENER programme. According to the Commission’s estimates, the breakthrough campaign alone requires public financing to the tune of approximately EUR 7 billion by the year 2003. That is to say, EUR 7 billion which has to come from the Member States and from the European Union. We know that this 81.1 million would only be a drop in the ocean, but we cannot, under any circumstances, accept that this sum should again be reduced to EUR 74 million, as specified in the common position. I would therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse this position of the Committee, which has been unanimously adopted, in tomorrow’s vote and to also ensure that corresponding decisions are taken in the budget votes.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to extend special congratulations to Mr Piétrasanta, for he and I worked well together in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy; he was a sympathetic and agreeable colleague and was open to all his fellow-Members’ suggestions, misgivings and questions. In the course of our deliberations on this report, we had interesting hearings with experts, whom we were able to ask about their reports, and who had interesting things to say about Galileo’s future uses. Even though some of us had to allow ourselves a slight smile at some of the statements and prognoses, I see Galileo as a model for the future and believe that it will yield returns on what is invested in it, something that is apparent from the fact that there have already been four responses to the invitation to tender. I can remember how, some two years or so ago, things looked very different and there was often doubt as to whether industry would get on board financially. Now we are about to open the documents and announce the result. That is something I cannot but welcome. In fact, Mr Piétrasanta’s report contains everything that matters. There is one further thing I want to mention, on which I tabled amendments in the committee and will be tabling another for the plenary; I ask your indulgence, but it is one that matters especially to me. I refer to the rescue and aid services that are to be implemented. Although COSPAS-SARSAT is well-known, there is also the IMMARSAT-E system, which is preferable to COSPAS-SARSAT in many respects, such as its rapid response times, more precise positioning, permanent availability, 100% compatibility with Galileo, and coverage of the whole of the earth’s surface. This system is important to people in trouble at sea, as such information is highly detailed and help can arrive at very short notice. I think this is something to which we should give some thought; a number of organisations – some of them military, like NATO – and Member States are already fitting this system into their Transall transport aircraft, helicopters and naval vessels. I think it would also be helpful to private individuals, and the two systems can certainly exist alongside each other. I hope that we will implement this tomorrow and that Members will support the one amendment of mine that is still to be voted on. Thank you all, and I wish you, Mr Piétrasanta, all the best for the future; something lies in store for you and we will miss you.

 Mr President, honourable Members, this report demonstrates yet again that the European Parliament is willing and able to identify compromises. We are concluding this matter at second reading. I would have wished that the cooperation, especially with the Council, had been as good as on trade. In these negotiations, the Council was a little less willing to compromise than in the other negotiations. Nonetheless, we have achieved a result that we can rely on and that we can accept. I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote for the amendments in Block I, and I think that although one or two Members might feel uncomfortable about the outcome of the conciliation process, by and large, this report is acceptable.

 Commissioner, a very good evening to you. I was in my seat in good time for the start. This evening’s debate, which we are holding in the cosy circle of insiders, revolves around a technology – cogeneration – which is a recognised environmental tool. Cogeneration can be used in many different ways, from district heating, mainly in northern Europe, to production plants, as in the ceramics and paper industries in other countries. Cogeneration, involves the simultaneous production of electricity and heat in what is usually an energy-saving process. This directive focuses primarily on high-efficiency cogeneration, namely processes which offer energy savings of at least 10%. This is one of the main reasons why cogeneration is used as a means of increasing energy efficiency and why it contributes to greater security of supply. Last month’s blackouts have demonstrated that we need to do something to improve security of supply. I would like to start by commenting on the way the Council deals with Parliament. This directive has been under discussion since September 2002 – nearly 18 months. The first reading in Parliament was very controversial. The second reading was much more consensus-oriented. Unfortunately, the Council common position accepted very few of the amendments proposed by this House. During the second reading, the Council again showed little flexibility and openness to our demands. As I see it, the Council adopted a ‘no can do’ position from the outset and we were repeatedly told that there was no scope for going beyond the common position. In my view, there were times when the way in which the negotiations were conducted was closer to a consultation procedure than to codecision. The compromise solutions were eventually adopted not because I as rapporteur was completely happy with the result, but rather because the Council put pressure on Parliament – there being no longer enough time for a conciliation procedure if the Council was to keep to schedule. More pressure was applied through the statements made by a number of delegations in the Council questioning the need for a directive promoting cogeneration, and making it clear that the directive would be blocked if Parliament requested anything beyond this support. Let me now tell you what I think merits praise in this directive. The aim of the directive is to promote cogeneration technologies, which can help to improve energy efficiency and security of supply. Cogeneration is now on the European Union’s energy policy agenda. The directive means the Union now has a policy on cogeneration. Europe has a harmonised definition of cogeneration, meaning that there is now a common understanding of what cogeneration is. Classification as high-efficiency cogeneration is determined using a two-stage process as defined in Annexes II and III of the directive. Firstly, cogenerated electricity is calculated using the Prothermo method as described in Annex II. Based on this method and taking into account the results from a CEN/CENELEC workshop currently in progress, the Commission is to devise a standard calculation for cogenerated electricity and the necessary guidelines for using it. Secondly, in order to qualify as high efficiency cogeneration, the process must provide energy savings of at least 10%, as laid down in Annex III. The Commission will provide harmonised reference values for calculating the energy savings. This was an important step forward and an important demand on Parliament’s part. The order in which Annexes II and III are applied has not been harmonised. The alternative calculation methods will therefore remain valid, and these will, if necessary, be harmonised in a new draft Commission directive. A standard procedure for issuing certificates of origin has already been provided, which is important for cross-border trade and therefore for the single market. The Member States are required to compile statistical data about national generation of electricity and heat using cogeneration. The Member States also have to assess the potential for using cogeneration and inform the Commission of their conclusions. The Commission is required to evaluate these reports and, if necessary, submit an action plan for developing cogeneration in the EU. National instruments and financial support should focus on primary energy savings. Legal and other barriers are to be removed. The directive establishes a definition of and a special status for micro-cogeneration. Under this directive, micro-cogeneration refers to installations with a maximum capacity of 50kWe. Micro-cogeneration operators may use certified values for calculation purposes, thus reducing their administrative burden. Member States can facilitate access to the grid for small installations and micro-cogeneration operators. Obviously we would have liked to see more on this subject. So what does not appear in the directive that we would have liked to see included? There are no targets set for the EU or individual Member States, no special assistance, and insufficient support for micro-cogeneration installations, which unfortunately means there is no assistance for increasing market penetration over the next few years. There are no practical measures aimed at increasing cogeneration as a proportion of total electricity generation in Europe, and grid access for cogenerated electricity is not adequately regulated in terms of support measures. At the moment, existing calculation methods have not been harmonised – in fact, alternative methods are valid until 2010. Cogeneration powered by nuclear energy has not been excluded from the scope of the directive. The European Parliament would undoubtedly have wished for a more ambitious directive. But at least this directive establishes a common understanding of cogeneration and lays a foundation for the promotion of cogeneration in Europe. The course has been set for harmonising calculation methods for cogenerated electricity and primary energy savings. The Member States are going to have to consider the technology, because they have to evaluate the national generation capacities and potential then report to the Commission. The Commission is required to present an action plan for developing cogeneration if there is no increase in cogeneration usage. This places cogeneration policy on the agenda at EU level, which represents a great success for the European Union. Let me close by challenging the Member States to report on the national potential for extending cogeneration as soon as possible, to make use of that potential, and to remove any and all barriers to increasing the share of cogeneration. I also say to the Commission that we need a new directive on European support schemes and total harmonisation of the energy market as soon as possible. As I conclude, let me thank my co-rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all those colleagues who have contributed, and also the Commission. I think we worked well together. In our discussions I repeatedly emphasised my understanding of a compromise as a solution that is slightly painful to all sides. I hope everyone has suffered to the same degree, and I hope that when we adopt the compromise amendments tomorrow we will have a reasonable directive. (Applause)

Mr President, to complete the picture, let me say that the Council sent a letter to the Secretariat and to me, so the formalities have been observed. The Council has acknowledged our compromise. I had an opportunity to speak yesterday about the report by Mr Chichester. At that time we had not received any letter. So we have made some progress. I now want to make sure that it is clear to those concerned what CHP really means. It means Christmas Holiday Package. I think we all deserve a pat on the back, and I wish you a merry Christmas.

 Thank you, Mr President. Commissioner, Mr Chichester, ladies and gentlemen, I was my group’s shadow rapporteur during the first reading of this Measuring Instruments Directive, and have followed the inception, development and progress of this directive throughout the two readings. The rapporteur has been kind enough to express his thanks to me, and I would like to take this opportunity to reciprocate. He has shown a masterly grasp of this highly complex and technical subject matter and settled into the work very quickly during the second reading. We worked well together. I think it is important to say this, for although our political views diverge in a number of respects, we were able to collaborate very closely and productively on this project. There is no point in seeking confrontation needlessly. I would therefore like to reciprocate his thanks. It was a great pleasure working with him. As has already been mentioned, this new directive replaces ten existing directives. It may thus be a small contribution to dismantling bureaucracy, which is something we are always calling for in a range of areas. It remains a complex but also a very important directive. On the issues of optionality and the distinction between manufacturers and traders – Amendment No 32 and Commissioner Liikanen’s statement play a key role here – there was vigorous debate about whether the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would be willing, yet again, to conclude the matter through an informal trialogue during the second reading. I would like to reiterate – especially since I myself will have an opportunity to make a statement on my own report tomorrow – that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is showing good will and is happy to adopt this approach. This must not, however, become the rule. We are making these exceptions in order to speed up the procedure. The compromises which have been found are acceptable. The Commission’s opinion and statement are good too. Naturally, I very much hope, as do the rapporteurs and my fellow Committee members, that the Council will write this letter and submit this declaration accordingly so that we can actually conclude the matter and do not wind up in a conciliation procedure after all, on the basis of the compromise which has now been achieved. Otherwise, I am very happy with the outcome. I hope that European industry, users and manufacturers will be satisfied with it. Perhaps you will permit me, at the end of our pre-Christmas session and almost at the end of the year, to express my hope that our British colleagues and above all the hospitality industry in Great Britain will be satisfied with the rules on measures for beer glasses. I understand that this is a particular problem. However, I think we have found a good solution here as well. Thank you very much for the collaboration and particular thanks to the interpreters for providing their services at such a late hour in the evening.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even the title of this directive indicates that this topic is a relatively complex one. I just want to try and do something I have done in the past, which is to explain what this is in very simple terms and for the benefit of those not involved in these matters. What we are talking about is the production, by the traditional means of steam, of electricity, which is then supplied for efficient use in industry or for heating. The promotion of this technology can be seen as being consonant with the objectives – the Kyoto commitments – that we, and many other countries, have set ourselves. It will help to save energy, to use it efficiently, and to reduce emissions of CO2. Implementing this technology can also make supplies more secure. My primary concern, when engaging in these discussions, when voting, and when tabling amendments, has been to shape a directive that will be applicable throughout Europe, at the same level, and with the same ground rules. This consideration applies in particular to the reference values to be used to define energy savings. We call upon the Commission to draw up, within an appropriate timeframe, a package of European reference values to facilitate comparisons of implementation in the various Member States. I saw it as important that there should be greater legal certainty within the European Union, and that the Member States should, on the basis of this directive – assuming that it enters into force after second reading and, perhaps, after a conciliation procedure – have legal certainty and be able to promote this technology. The report is a highly technical one, and discussing it was a relatively complicated business. Our discussions were lively, but also very fair, and we were very fair-minded in our dealings with each other. There was no confrontation between Left and Right of the sort I have previously described, but rather a confrontation between North and South, each being convinced that one method or another was better. I believe that the compromise we have reached is a sound one. All of us – myself included – have had to moderate our demands to some extent. I was not happy with all the compromises, but I accepted them as being what this is all about. At the end of the day, this result, at least in the committee, where there were 32 votes in favour, none against, and 11 abstentions – let me mention at this point that I am to this day unsure how the 11 abstentions came about – has shown that we have come to a sensible compromise. Including those in my report, we started out with 240 amendments. Tomorrow, there will be 11 amendments on the table for us to vote on. I think that is a very fine achievement. We have done good work, and I can tell you that one or other of the eleven amendments will not get my vote, but, on the whole, what comes out of first reading stage will look very good. I just hope that the Council will match this by putting a proper political position on the table in May, or by June at the latest. What the Council is currently discussing differs to quite a large extent from what we have been discussing here, so the second reading is guaranteed to be, once more, exciting and highly contentious. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will go well and that we will adopt the report; then I will already be looking forward to the discussions in the course of second reading. If we all work together properly on that, and if the Council is well disposed, we will manage to get this report adopted by the end of this Parliamentary term – I think, at second reading stage or perhaps after a conciliation procedure – and then legal certainty will have been created. To that extent, I think, we have been able to improve the Commission proposal by making it more precise, specific and exact, and I hope it will meet with general approval tomorrow. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we draw near to the close of the debate it is not easy to introduce another new aspect. Since there is broad agreement here that we welcome this process and we are taking for granted that ten new states will soon be sending their representatives here officially, I should, however, like to raise one aspect again, that is the necessity of canvassing in all future 25 countries for this also to find acceptance with public opinion, with the citizens. I think that is a great task that lies ahead of us and cannot only begin when the accession process is almost completed and the treaties signed. I come from a region that in 1990 entered this European Union overnight, as it were. I know that many citizens experienced the necessary restructuring process as a personal defeat, a downgrading that marked them out as losers. I think we need to make clear to people in the candidate countries, too, that membership of the European Union also results in resources and means being made available to cushion the citizens and help them through the difficult process. That will be a big task for us because after all we need majorities in the population. If we in this Parliament are agreed, that is to be welcomed, but we must take the citizens with us in this process, which will certainly not be as easy as it sounds. Let us work together to make it possible. As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to see the advisory committees more fairly and intensively involved in the next concrete discussions of the outcome of negotiations. I know that is a great political achievement, a great political report, but the individual specialist committees must surely have something important to say about the process.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my task was to draft a horizontal report on industry, external trade, research and energy for twelve candidate countries. That was difficult enough in itself. Providing a comprehensive overview of the report in just one minute now is impossible. I therefore draw attention to the short justification provided in my report. Anyone interested should have a look at it. I should like to mention one issue which is very close to my heart, and wish to underline rather more pointedly than my colleague Willy Görlach that as I come from a region which has been part of the European Union since 1990 and has experienced a great deal of solidarity in the last twelve years, I have a very clear appreciation of the efforts made by the candidate countries, especially the Central and Eastern European countries, to become eligible for accession. What I would now ask of us all – from the European Union, especially the Council and particularly from two countries which have always been the driving force in this European Union, namely Germany and France – is to remove, as soon as possible, the obstacles which stand in the way of union with these countries and enable us, myself included, to conduct a European election campaign on both sides of the Oder and Neisse in 2004.

Mr President, this is a first for me, being the first time I have taken the floor during a vote, and I also want to keep it brief. I am grateful for the signal that Parliament is sending out to the Council, and hope that the Council will give equally definite agreement to this project in March so that we can get things moving at last!

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and above all, you interpreters who are assembled here in such numbers for so few of us Members, it is always a pleasure to be able to discuss such an interesting and exciting topic at such a late hour. I hope that the lateness of the hour will not downgrade the project. I refer to the Galileo satellite navigation system, the first great project to be shaped jointly by the European institutions and the ESA. In technical, economic and political terms, it is eminently comparable with such projects as the Airbus and the GSM mobile telecommunications standard. This system will to some degree be in technological competition with the existing American GPS system, which is a good thing for European technology, but it will also be compatible with GPS – at least I hope it will, and that is something by which we set store – and be able to supplement it. I have been told that the United States is seriously concerned about developments in Europe. That cannot be a bad thing, and can mean only that we are on the right road and that we will make technological progress in Europe by the use of this system. It is certainly in competition, in technological terms, with the existing GPS, but there is also the possibility of their interacting. We are working towards the system being able to use the same receivers for GPS and Galileo signals. That will increase the utility of both systems. I would also like, at this point, to refer to the coordination between GPS, Galileo and EGNOS. Most discussions fail to do justice to this point, but I think it too is important. After 11 September and during the Afghanistan conflict, the United States had apprehensions about the security aspects of what is a civilian project, but these will be safeguarded. Both the civilian character and the public control of the Galileo project make disruption, interference and misuse impossible. A certain levy on receivers will mean that broad use will be free of charge. Broad use of GPS is free of charge, and so will Galileo be. More exact services of a higher order will have to be paid for in order to guarantee the refinancing of the running and development costs. The service will, however, be permanently available. This afternoon I had the pleasure of a conversation with the US Government's representative in Brussels, who again expressed his concern about the project's development. I was able to reassure him, but not in the sense that we would unreservedly submit ourselves to the GPS system. I made it clear to him that we are building our own system, that we are working towards cooperation, but that we will carry on with development and not let ourselves be led into some kind of technological dependency. I think that these informally expressed wishes and these remarks show that we are still on the right road. The Member States have delayed taking a decision for a long time, and I hope that they will enthusiastically endorse this project in March, despite certain problems that they have with the Price Waterhouse study – indeed, I get indications from various Member State governments that they will. I hope that we will get to that, and believe that it is high time we did. We are already a couple of months behind, but will be able to make up for them. I would like to again express my gratitude to the Commissioner for the conversation we had and also for providing these documents, which again explain what Galileo is about and can allay any suspicions or misgivings. Let us turn now to the report itself and to the proposal, which is not uncontroversial. I think there is, as there was in the past, overwhelming agreement that we want this project and that we want it to be a civilian one. As a result, though, of events last year and in recent months, we are also agreed that it needs to be available to some degree to our troops who are sent out to maintain the peace. That will be feasible, technically feasible, but it will also be politically desired and feasible. It is, though, to remain a civilian system, as it was before. There were great problems in discussions about how private enterprise was to be involved in this undertaking. The Commission proposal works on the assumption that private firms will be involved, including financially. Financial participation is – shall we say – a symbolic act. It would be enough to finance the development stage by means of public funds alone, but industry is to be involved. That is what I want too, but I have had no clear indication from industry that they are becoming amicably disposed towards the Commission proposal and getting on board the Joint Undertaking. My proposal that the development company should be established, coming into being in parallel with the Joint Undertaking but dovetailing closely with it, offers a compromise, a way out of the dilemma. Indications from the business world are variable – some are rejecting this proposal, while others have a very open mind about it. I have endeavoured simply to use this proposal to reduce to some extent the inhibitions that businesses have, and I hope that they will participate in the development company. In so far, I hope for broad support tomorrow. Unfortunately, I cannot support the European People's Party's proposals, which date back to the Commission proposal and thus, in my opinion, give industry another argument against joining in.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as everything has been said, but not by me – as they say – I will make two or three points simply to underline what has been discussed by the previous speakers. I belong to the minority who, at first reading, were not satisfied with Article 6 of the framework directive. The compromise that has now been presented meets with my approval. I think a balance has been achieved between the national regulators' shadowing of the market and the Commission's right of veto, in order to stimulate the progress of the internal market, of which we are all in favour, even my group. This represents, in our view, very much another fragmentation of the market. I want to say something general about the modus operandi itself. Yes, we are dealing with a very fast-moving market and rapidly evolving technology, and we have tried to take that into account by acting relatively speedily. I want, though, just to say another word of admonition. Parliament – by which I mean, we – should not always deny ourselves our rights in the legislative process. We realise that from time to time, when the worst comes to the worst, but I think it must remain an exception. I would like to highlight another point. Mrs Hieronymi made it very clear – and, as a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I can only underline what she said – that a unitary standard for digital television, and its interoperability, are issues not only for industry policy, but also for consumers. I have promised consumers and the general public in my constituency that we would ensure that there was a standard that would enable them to receive on one TV set everything that they wanted to see and that they would not have to install several sets. I believe we have to go a bit further down that road. I would like to emphasise the very demand that Mrs Hieronymi made when she spoke just now. Perhaps the Commission and the Council can leap a bit further over the shadow thrown by digital television and reach a compromise. Then I, too, would find it easier to vote in favour of the package as a whole. I will end my speech there and point out that I have stuck to the speaking time allotted to me.
Glante (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when one is so far down the list of speakers, one always runs the risk of repeating certain points. I want to try and avoid that. But I too should like to highlight two or three points. I too should like to express my gratitude for the interesting and exciting cooperation in Parliament right across the group divide. There are certainly material arguments here which go beyond political bounds. I too found the discussions with various representatives from companies large and small right across Europe very interesting and, although not everyone will be satisfied, I think we are on the right track towards a more viable future. It has been my conviction over recent years that we need to create tight, bundled rules which allow us to react quickly in the future to technological progress. In this respect, my maxim still holds: less regulation may be much better regulation. I think that, in concentrating on the directives being debated today, we have succeeded in doing this. I also think that sooner or later – I think relatively soon – we shall be able to start applying general competition law. I must, of course, pour just a little cold water on one point. I personally and many of my fellow Members fully support Amendment No 78, as tabled by Mrs Niebler, and shall vote in favour of it. As I said, this support cuts more or less across the group divide, because I am positive that this proposed amendment does not stand in the way of European harmonisation. On the contrary, in my view, the type of licensing procedure and powers set out in this article are more time-consuming and bureaucratic and, in my book, constitute interference in regional affairs in the public-service radio sector, as my fellow Member, Karin Junker, has already said. In this respect I feel strongly that, whatever the approach, we must prevent the ‘must carry’ obligation from being abolished through the back door.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to Nicholas Clegg also for his hard work. To give one light-hearted example, his compromise proposals reached me when I was on the way home on the motorway. Of course I pulled over, in accordance with the law, and then discussed them further with him. This shows how we worked on this and I think that this was superb. We are also willing to do this again in future, but we could do with a bit more time now and again to discuss particular points in still greater depth. Our political objective was to enhance competition and so smooth the path to the information society. This regulation is intended to achieve a marked improvement in competition in the local access network, with the aim, for example, of giving Internet services better access to the mass market, so that market penetration will increase. This initiative will ultimately also help to promote the information society. But quicker and cheaper Internet access without content is worthless. Above all, the information society must mean investment in people and their skills. One important point is that the regulation regulates in the spirit of the original telecommunications liberalisation, that is in an asymmetrical way. This has certainly demonstrated its value when it comes to improving competition. But this regulation will be superseded in future and we will move on to a new regulatory framework under competition law. 

In view of that, I would say that Amendment No 13 is particularly important, as it provides for a new Recital 10(a) which emphasises once again that a new regulatory framework will replace this regulation in the not too distant future. Of at least equal importance is the fact that the Council is not holding up the telecommunications regulatory package. I also trust that the Council will adopt it soon and that we will continue the consultation procedure on the rest of the package quickly and in a serious manner. I hope that the Council will not leave us in the lurch should one or other Member State perhaps still have reservations. Our work should set an example here. We have reached agreement quickly and effectively, and I hope that the Council will follow suit.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of parliament from Brandenburg, an East-German Land
, allow me to stress at this point how proud I am to act as spokesman for my committee in this debate. You might say that I represent a region which, ten years ago, represented a good part of enlargement to the east – I too lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain. Allow me also to say at this point that I have a great deal of respect for the citizens of the central and eastern European countries who, ten years ago, had the courage to go into the streets and start this process. They deserve my thanks, as of course do the Member States of the European Union at the time and the Commission and Parliament, for the solidarity which they have always demonstrated with our regions. I am speaking on behalf of the Industry Committee – to abbreviate its full title – on the areas of industry, external trade, research and energy. This is a broad political field which includes highly explosive smaller issues and covering this broad spectrum for the twelve different candidate countries from central Europe, Malta and Cyprus was a huge challenge. Allow me to comment on a few focal points. Industrial change in the industrial sector is already in the final stage, although it remains on the agenda and needs to be implemented more intensively. This change places heavy demands on the people in the candidate countries but, at the same time, it guarantees their future and their children’s future. The economic changeover is not for the EU’s sake, a point which needs stressing. The competitiveness of their own country is at stake, irrespective of whether or not they join the EU. Three points need highlighting in the industrial sector. First: industrial structures must continue to be adapted at least as quickly as hitherto. Secondly: there must be guaranteed improvements to and simplification of the legal framework for market access and financing. Stability fosters economic success. Thirdly: supplementary measures, such as training people, social protection and hence social stability, and an active job market policy are also extremely important. In the trade sector it must be stressed that a national trade policy is incompatible with EU-membership. It is vital for trade policy between the EU and candidate countries to be coordinated pending accession and this is being done to an increasing extent. A few comments on new technologies: these countries too are moving from an industrial to an information society. This process runs in parallel to enlargement. If we are to have a common information area, we must make huge joint efforts in this sector. The information society is important to old as well as new sectors. The public sector should set an example in the central and eastern European and in the other candidate countries. Research must be strengthened overall, especially in new technological sectors, and it is vital for these countries to be included in the European networks. Allow me to make one more comment on the energy sector, which has already been addressed once today. Energy generation and distribution must continue to be made more efficient, while complying with environmental standards. The whole European energy market will change on accession. The energy mix will no longer be the same. A sensitive area has already been addressed today. I refer to nuclear energy. The most important aspect is compliance with current safety standards and the agreed closure of unmodernised plants. I too should like to stress on behalf of my committee that I am not in favour of linking accession dates to closures. They are two separate issues. However much some people wish it did, diversifying out of atomic energy does not form part of the Community acquis
. Hence, if we are to be honest, we cannot keep setting up new hurdles in these areas. The process of change and the momentum of this process of change will cause structural adjustment difficulties on both sides. Particular attention – and here I agree with the previous speaker – needs to be paid to border regions. Although there are excellent medium-term prospects for the border regions within the European Union, huge adjustment difficulties will need to be overcome in the short term. We already have experience of both from enlargement to Spain and Portugal. We – the Member States first, but also the EU – have a duty to provide suitable support for border regions. On balance, our conclusion is this: the candidate countries have already gone part of the way. The EU must continue to give them permanent support and must not neglect its own duties as regards structural change, including that of the institutions.

Mr President, I shall not have the last word; that is the Commissioner's prerogative. I wish to subscribe to the thanks that have been expressed to the rapporteur and to emphasise that I have heard from insiders that the programme has so far been an unqualified success. I believe that one reason for this has been the way in which the support has been accompanied by intensive consultancy and local networking. This needs to be re-emphasised. The MEDIA desk and the local MEDIA branches have proved to be very useful instruments. It is vital for these accompanying institutional measures to be retained. The MEDIA branch offices help to minimise the obstacles to European cooperation, for example. On the one hand, MEDIA is about culture and common European cultural traditions in the audiovisual domain. This is still a rather tender sapling which needs our undivided attention. Moreover, as other speakers have already pointed out, it is also an economic asset that is judged by its success. One key criterion of the success of the new MEDIA programme will be its support for the development, marketing and promotion of films that the public wants to see. I make no attempt to conceal my own personal view on this matter. Hollywood cannot be beaten, in my opinion, by money and quotas but only by quality. Recent years have shown that people are interested in many different types of film. Europe must not shy away from this window of opportunity. We must continue to foster this encouraging development, and to that end the budgetary increase requested in Mrs Hieronymi's report is a logical move. Finally, I should like to mention that many of the roots of our European culture lie in Central and Eastern Europe. A higher budget will also make it possible to involve the Central and Eastern European countries to a greater extent in these programmes. The last word on an increased budget may not yet have been spoken, and we shall perhaps be discussing further increases over the next few years.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the President pointed out in his introduction, it has taken five years for the basis of the October 1995 report to evolve into the report we are dealing with now. This can be attributed to the fact that the market development of digital television has been much slower than anticipated. However, digital television has become increasingly important over the last few months and years, in the wake of media convergence. The Internet and home banking via digital television are examples of how the range of services has widened.   This report will form the basis of a draft directive. Our group has two demands to make of the framework regulation for digital TV. Firstly, the framework must not restrict the meteoric technological development in this sector, and it must not be too rigid.  Secondly, the framework must, however, safeguard the European internal market and consumer interests. We want to, and must, work within these two parameters.  This entails the following: firstly, the transmission obligations are still an important means of meeting social requirements, for example minority language programmes or the important role of the public broadcasting sector.  Secondly, there is the interoperability of the access systems to digital TV at subscriber level, as mentioned by the previous speaker Mr van Velzen. It is unacceptable for subscribers to need several receptor boxes in order to receive programmes. It should be one box per subscriber and no more.   Thirdly, technical interoperability must not be compromised or undermined on account of national monopoly formation or abuse of a dominant position.   As I see it, our aim is to create a European internal market, promote technical development and bring about television without frontiers – something the two previous speakers touched on – and that includes making sure that in future, citizens of other countries who are resident in the European Union are able to receive their pay TV services.   I am delighted with the report by Mrs Thors. We adopted a very well balanced report in committee.   Unfortunately, I am unable to endorse the two proposed amendments tabled by Mrs Thors, on behalf of our group, for the same reasons advanced by Mr van Velzen. We intend to vote against both proposed amendments. Apart from that, we congratulate you on this report and hope that in the course of the next few days and weeks, the Commission will present a sound basis for a directive.
Glante (PSE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr van Velzen for his report and I would like to thank him warmly for his accommodating and constructive cooperation – it sets the tone for how this kind of report should be dealt with.   There are two questions which, to my mind, need to be asked about this report: how much regulation and what sort of regulation do we need to promote a competitive European internal market? As I see it, three questions have emerged from our joint debate. Firstly, there is the question as to what the role of the Member States should be. European rules are needed for a European market, for example the unbundling of subscriber access, and of course the much-lamented principle of subsidiarity means that we need rules where they can best be made use of. This may be at Member State level, but it may also be at EU level. That being the case, we should at least issue a reminder about the need for reinforced cooperation and coordination between the national regulators in the Union.   The second issue – also raised by previous speakers – concerns the auctions, or beauty contests. I will be quite honest with you, opinion is extremely divided in my group too, on which of the two is the best method. I still think that auctions are the most viable way of finding the most efficient and effective operator in a competitive setting. Of course it is a problem that some Member States opt for this method and others go for a different one. That is bound to lead to distortions in competition. When these come to light, surely it falls to the Commission to intervene. We should learn our lesson from that and make sure that in future, everyone is treated equally.   Thirdly, how long can rules be put in place for? There will need to be a review as of the year 2005, at all events, for no one is in a position to say at the present time what we will need in the way of new sector-specific rules in the year 2005, or indeed whether we will need them at all.   On a final note, I have a comment of a personal nature to make about the caller location system and the 112 emergency number. We had a few discussions about this in committee. I must admit that having lived behind the iron curtain in the Eastern block for four decades, and having grown up there, I am always sceptical about being monitored and controlled ‘big brother is watching you’ style. I therefore think it is absolutely essential where the 112 emergency number is concerned, for the prior consent of the user to be required for the use of caller location facilities, even in the event of an emergency. But that is something I personally feel strongly about. We will find a reasonable solution when it comes to the vote.

Commissioner Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to comment on the Alyssandrakis report on the Commission communication concerning radio spectrum policy. This communication and the report on the communication are amongst Parliament’s reports on the telecommunications sector, and they are all very closely linked. I could mention the report by Mrs Thors, which we are to vote on in the near future, and the reports by Mr van Velzen and Mr Paasilinna, who has just spoken, as well as that of Mr Alyssandrakis.   I would like to take this opportunity to again express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and those responsible within the groups, for the inter-group cooperation in this matter. Unlike grid-bound infrastructure, frequencies cannot be multiplied ad infinitum. As such, they should be treated as a special case. Radio spectrum policy is gaining in importance within the European Union, but also worldwide, in connection with new technologies – UMTS has been mentioned – but also in connection with the famous ‘making it through the last mile’, so as to create some movement in charges for local phone calls.   The granting of licences – whether by auction or by ‘beauty contest’ – is regulated, and as previous speakers have mentioned, the United Kingdom has had first experience of this and results are now available. Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis made reference to this. Auctions can lead to high prices. It is also suspected in Germany that high prices are achieved at auction. Several of my colleagues in my Group are concerned because they suspect that the high figures achieved at auctions, plus the investment that has to be made in this sector, will inevitably lead to the overall cost being passed on to consumers. This may well be the case. However, one thing I would point out is that even when the average weighted rate of VAT was introduced, the first mobile phones were expensive, and the charges were very high. However, increasing market penetration brought the prices down.   I believe we should appeal to the national governments to use the proceeds from the auctions held in these sectors for the implementation of the information society and for broadening the basis thereof in the Member States. This is a cue for me to mention the ‘Schools on-line’ or ‘Public administration and libraries on-line’ programme that we have called for repeatedly. I feel that the average EU citizen interested in using the Internet is bound to continue using PCs at home, in the library or in the office. I do not think they will be clamouring to be the first to use the UMTS equipment.   In addition, the proceeds from the auctions will be able to ease the burden on Member States’ budgets, which will – and I am digressing slightly from our specialist technical subject now – give politics renewed power to act. As such, I believe the governments are quite justified in receiving the proceeds. I hope that my fellow delegates will endorse Amendment No 8 tabled by my Group. Unfortunately, we are unable to support any of the others.

Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, in discussing the budget for 2005, we have, of course, merely set the ball rolling. It will be a matter for the next Parliament to bring the process to a conclusion. In this respect it is an unusual budget. It is also unusual in that it is heavily influenced by the particular context in which it is being prepared. On the one hand, we want to make enlargement work and must therefore create the appropriate conditions. In addition, everything to do with enlargement is all about the future and about the availability of financial resources too. We shall also discuss the budget in the light of the debate on the financial perspective, because this 2005 budget will be the last but one before the new financial perspective. It goes without saying that the figures we estimate represent choices for the future, and they will also be one of the foundations of the debate on the financial perspective, whether we like it or not. At the same time, Europe is not an island. We Europeans must engage in international politics, whether in the field of foreign policy, where we must work to prevent conflict, or in the sphere of internal security, to which you have referred, where we must play our part in a concerted effort to combat international crime. Lastly, we must rise to the challenge of global competition and ensure that our businesses and our economy can hold their own. As in the preceding years, we shall try to ensure that the budget on the table in front of us is a tight one, even in the conditions I have just described. It must, however, also be adequate. We shall not let anyone cry ‘miser’ at those who advocate great prudence and thrift, nor shall we tolerate any accusations of extravagance against those who point out that more money is needed in particular areas. In the process of drawing up this budget in the conditions I have described, which make it no easier to reach agreement, we shall continue to adhere to the line we have always taken in the past, pressing for the adoption of a tight but adequate budget, so that the public know that they can rely on the European Parliament to deal responsibly with budgetary matters.

Mr President, President Prodi, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we are embarking today on a debate whose preparation in recent weeks has already been accompanied by a great deal of shadow-boxing, and I am pleased that the proposals are finally on the table so we can talk about them. I am not so lacking in self-confidence that I feel any need to be bound solely by what others are suggesting. Nor do I feel any need to be bound solely by the Commission’s proposals, just as I see little reason to take the individual statements from the Council or parts of the Council as a benchmark for myself. Instead, as Members of this Parliament, which is one of the institutions to vote on this financial perspective, we will address these issues over the coming weeks and months, and indeed over the coming years – that is how long such difficult discussions can take. In doing so, it is not acceptable for one side to say: ‘We have an idea and we want a vast amount of cash to implement it’. That cannot be the right approach. However, the other side also cannot say: ‘Look, you have a bit of cash in Europe, see how far you get with that’. Both of these approaches are wrong. Here is what we have to do. We must face up to the challenges that we are already discussing jointly, and then work through them point by point. Let me say this: all of us – including those who have been regaling us with grand words today – will have to be flexible on a number of issues. We will have to discuss what we want to do in the field of research and development. At our last session, we agreed that 3% of gross domestic product should be spent on this policy area in Europe. This 3% cannot be accommodated in the budget, for then the 1.24% or 1.0% or whatever would not be worth the paper it is written on. We therefore need to talk about budget combinations. We must discuss what should be done at national level in the Member States in future, and we must discuss what we can best do jointly at European level. We need to do this in all the areas before us. That includes foreign policy, for example, where the European Development Fund is currently outside the budget; we will integrate it. We will also have to discuss what proportion of international conflict prevention we want to fund from the European budget and what the Member States will cover in future. We have adopted a figure of 0.7% of GDP as a guide here. As regards justice and home affairs, we will have to discuss whether we want to maintain Europol and Eurojust as small units, as at present, or whether we are aiming for further development here. Another question is how much of the fight against organised crime should be funded at European level and what should be funded at local level. All these issues will have to be discussed. We will also have to talk about what comes under each budget heading and which proportion is paid from which budget. I am very flexible here, and I am approaching this debate with an open mind. I believe this is essential, for otherwise – especially given the war-cries now resounding through the corridors – it will be impossible to create the right atmosphere for a substantive joint debate. I think we have found some good things in the proposals you have presented. We will be looking at them. We will of course be discussing with you why the proposed duration of the financial perspective is seven years. It is important to highlight the fact that this may result in a Parliament such as this one – as Mr Elles has said – being excluded completely from the debate about the funding of the European Union’s future. A seven-year period could produce that situation. We will need to talk about the growth rates that you have taken as a basis for your financial calculations. I think I saw at one point that you are assuming economic growth of 4.5% per annum. If we achieve that growth rate over the next seven years in Europe, we will have no problem with any aspect of funding. We therefore need to discuss which statistics you are taking as a basis for your overall figures. We will have to discuss the structure you are proposing, and whether it is transparent, efficient and flexible. Our interest in reforming agricultural policy also means that we want to invest in the development of rural regions within the framework of general agricultural policy. Is this possible, based on your proposals? Or will we have new hurdles to overcome yet again in a new financial perspective – hurdles which cannot be overcome? We need some measure of flexibility because as several other speakers have said, challenges will arise over a seven-year period which we cannot predict today. I am firmly convinced that we, in this House, should engage in this discussion with self-confidence. We have our own ideas and we will set out our vision of the Europe we want to achieve. We will talk about the resources to be deployed for this purpose. I look forward to our discussions with you. I also look forward to the discussions with the Council. Both of you will have to deal with a self-confident but serious and solid Parliament. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin – as all the other group spokespersons have done – by expressing my warmest thanks to the two rapporteurs for their work this year. Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill have produced an outstanding report. I would also like to thank our Chairman of the Committee on Budgets once again for his cooperation over the last two years. He has said that he no longer wishes to chair the committee, but I am sure he will keep his seat in the next Parliament and the House will continue to benefit from his wit and wisdom, unless the British people are foolish enough not to re-elect him. However, I cannot imagine that the British would do such a thing. Of course they will re-elect him and then we will have him back again. Europe is being built by those who have a desire to create a future and bear responsibility. I think it is important to state this clearly at the present time. In order to achieve this goal, extraordinary patience and an ability to listen are essential, and extraordinary efforts must be made to achieve mutual understanding. Only if we listen to each other and seek to understand each other is it possible to achieve extraordinary things. In this respect, Europe’s citizens can depend on this House. Where others sow the seeds of discord, we have shown solidarity. Where others incite mistrust, we dare to build democracy and trust in each other’s ability. Where others instil fear, we offer fresh prospects, and where others vie for power, we seek compromises. The result is the ability to produce a budget like the one before us. It is thrifty, sound and forward-looking. Yes, it is thrifty, contrary to popular opinion. This morning, the President of this House, speaking in this debate, pointed out that over recent years, the total discretionary expenditure added by the Council amounts to EUR 33 billion, whereas Parliament, under its discretion, has added just EUR 21 million. In other words, we have exercised far more restraint in this area, and despite the frequent accusations, we are not the ones constantly stretching the budget. In fact, the 2004 budget represents a decrease of 0.26% for commitments for the EU of the Fifteen and, indeed, a reduction of 3% for payments. Even if we include the new countries in the equation, the staff-to-population ratio falls from 0.8 officials per 10 000 inhabitants to 0.7 per 10 000. Let me give you a comparison: according to the OECD, Spain, for example, has 388 officials per 10 000 inhabitants. This is the personnel basis on which we are shaping the future of the European Union. In other words, we are extremely thrifty, and we also exercise sound financial management. We want the funds to be spent on the purposes for which they are intended, which is why we exercise control over spending, firstly through the Committee on Budgetary Control, but also at the financing planning stage. That is why we set up reserves in various areas. This year, we have formed relatively few reserves. Those we have set up are linked to specific conditions. We will dissolve these reserves as quickly as possible, as soon as we know that the relevant measures have been adopted. Blind faith would be overly optimistic, while excessive mistrust would be paralysing. We are therefore adopting a middle way. As Social Democrats, we are trying to work with properly established and tightly restricted reserves. This budget also shows that we are future-oriented. That is why we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists (PSE Group) can say that we are very, very satisfied with the result. What we have achieved is that in future, we will be working through OLAF to combat VAT fraud in Europe. Here, financial resources that can be generated must be generated. Next year too, as in previous years, we will continue to promote small and medium enterprises, for they are the backbone of the European economy. We want to prepare for demographic change, as population levels are declining throughout Europe. In Spain and Italy, the population figures are already falling. In Germany, this will be the case from next year. This will have an impact on life in our communities. How will we target the Structural Funds to take account of the fact that in future, Europe will have around 15% fewer people? We need to find an answer to this question – and we cannot wait until the problem is upon us. We need to make preparations now. Under Heading 4: External Policies, we are in part consolidating existing measures. However, we will also master the new challenges. We will provide adequate funds for Iraq for measures which can actually be implemented. Nonetheless, we will still provide EUR 168 million for Afghanistan, and we will continue to participate in the funding of measures in the Balkans. What we need, however, is not just remedial aid after the event; we must also be working with an eye to the future. That is why we are pleased that we have been able to expand the resources for preventive measures: to promote human rights and democracy around the world and to combat ABC weapons and land mines. I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, including the Commissioner. I think we have a very good budget before us. Naturally, we will be voting for it.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen said that some of what we are hearing about the discussions gives us cause for concern. I can certainly confirm that my own group feels that way, particularly as regards the impact on one of the fundamental rights of a parliament in a democracy. Discussions are taking place on budgetary rights, the essential right of any parliament, which represent the origins and the starting point of any process of democratisation: the right of Parliament, the directly elected representatives of the people, to make decisions on financial resources. The very foundations of this right are being attacked. I admit that we were not all happy about the outcome of the Convention, because we had, of course, expected more. We had hoped for more democratisation, so as to provide greater transparency for Europe's citizens about who is responsible for what, where the money comes from and how it is spent. More transparency is needed here, and the public have a right to expect it. In accordance with the outcome of the Convention, we have a financial framework that sets an upper limit and therefore puts a cap on expenditure. This framework will in future be set by the Council, subject to the approval of Parliament. That means that there is a predetermined planning procedure. When it comes to income, the Council has the last word. Nothing has changed there. We have criticised that, but that is how it is. As regards expenditure, and this is the small step forward that we have identified, in accordance with the Convention's draft the final decision is to be taken by Parliament. This is now being attacked by some Member States and also by the Finance Ministers. What is this all about? The message that gives is that this House is not able to make objective decisions on behalf of the public. What impression do these governments' representatives expect to create in six months' time at the next European elections, if they do not trust their own candidates to vote responsibly on expenditure at European level? We have already heard the criticism that parliaments do not know how to deal with money. That has always been the case down the centuries. But we have never heard it before from a democratically elected government referring to a democratically elected parliament. This is something new, and it really is intolerable if you take a look at the facts. The rate of budgetary increases approved in some areas – well over 8% in one area decided by the Council, agricultural expenditure, compared with the maximum increase of 2.5% envisaged for the overall budget – do not suggest that the Council, which up to now has been able to decide on its own, is particularly thrifty. Just look at the Council's administrative budget for next year. The Council is claiming an increase of 20.8% for itself, more than any other institution, in order to build up and enlarge its administration. We, on the other hand, have always kept within our upper limits. We do not need any coaching on how to manage the funds that Europe's citizens entrusted to us properly. We will hold our ground across the board if anyone tries to undermine Parliament's fundamental democratic right to set the budget. They will soon find out that no parliamentarian who takes his job seriously will go along with that. As Mr Brok put it, that really would be a declaration of war on this House. I would like to thank the presidency for saying that it wishes to respect the outcome of the Convention and to fight for its implementation. I would like to thank all those national governments that are supporting that. But I warn all those who are toying with the idea of attacking this right that they are opening themselves up to accusations that they do not want to use the Constitution to extend democracy in Europe, that they do not want to strengthen or further democracy, but that they want to bypass it and undermine it, by depriving Parliament of one of its central rights.

 Mr President, if I am right in my understanding of this, it says here that we are allocating EUR 8.4 million to the political parties. It now appears from what the House has resolved that the line being marked ‘p.m.’, is a token entry. Voting on that now would go against what the plenary has already voted, and so I now ask whether that is actually the case. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me thank both the rapporteurs for the work they have done this year. I believe that we have been able to incorporate in this Budget a number of things that not only consolidate what we already have, and make clear where our priorities lie, but also make it abundantly clear that, whilst retaining what has stood the test of time, we also want to demonstrate a flexible approach to the tasks with which the future will present us. Let me give as an example our desire to use more funds for the prevention of crises rather than for trouble-shooting. We want to combat the VAT fraud in Europe, so that the European Union’s receipts can be improved, and so that we do not have to extract from taxpayers money that other people should be honest enough to pay. Fraud stands at a high level, and that is something we want to combat. There is consensus on the need for us to take action to deal with it. We are preparing the European Union for demographic change and for the demands that this will bring with it; at any rate, we have taken this as our theme, and we want more and improved cooperation in the war on organised crime. This Budget reflects our desire to strengthen and support Eurojust and Europol. This European Union of ours will continue in future to be characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises, which, as they give life to the economy, we want to support and enable them to enjoy the advantages of the internal market and use them to the utmost. We will orient this Budget as far as possible towards savings. What this means is that our group has looked closely at the various areas with an eye to ensuring that what is demanded of the Member States – which are themselves currently having problems with their budgets – is nothing more than is unavoidable and necessary. We will stick to that line in each of the various categories, as it is clear to us that the multiannual financial framework that we have laid down following negotiations with the Council is not merely optional, but a fixed point of reference, and it sets the bounds within which we want to manoeuvre. In category 1B, then, we will not be advocating that the upper limits be exceeded, nor will we vote for it. All those in this House who want to do that must know that this resolution may well be only at first reading stage – and so it can be said that it does not count, as the counting is done at the end – but it does indicate whether or not we want to keep to the upper limits in this area. We will not, in any case give our support to any attempt to exceed the upper limits. In other areas, too, we want to ensure the targeted use of the money at our disposal, but also that we keep to what we have promised. We will make available the staff that enlargement requires. We will adjust the multiannual programmes in order that nothing of what they contain should be lost. We will also make sure that the Structural Funds contain sufficient payment appropriations for the candidate countries, to whom it will have to be made plain that this means that, next year or right through the period we have negotiated with them, they will get not one euro extra; there is only the possibility of certain obligations being discharged earlier. We will call for payments from the Structural Funds to be increased, for we believe that the existing backlog in payments must not be tolerated. We have to ensure that what has been announced and promised is actually kept to, and that we actually do whatever we can to help support the regions. We will therefore be asking for additional funding, which is also what the members of the Council, the individual Member States, will say that they want when asked individually. As soon as the Council meets as a body, it always has a problem with making sufficient funding available. So, although we will be calling for additional funding, that will – as you have said yourself – of course remain within the bounds of what is necessary. Commissioner Schreyer has said that there has never before been such a small difference between your and our proposals. The biggest problem is with category 4. As Mr Garriga Polledo has said, we have seen to it that our traditional areas are maintained, but this House has before it an amendment on aid for Iraq, in which EUR 500 million are asked for – EUR 500 million, even though we know from the most diverse published sources, especially the Commission’s own, that it will not in any way be possible to properly administer these EUR 500 million in Iraq next year. No administrative structures are in place, and there is nobody on the ground who can put the money to proper use. Even though there are no projects to which the money is to be allocated, this figure of EUR 500 million has been put before us, and a majority in the Committee on Budgets has even adopted it. To those who tabled this amendment, I say that, just as involvement in the war in Iraq split the European Union, so their amendment divides this House. They are not interested in a joint solution; rather, they want the EUR 500 million to serve as a warning that we could use it now, and want to be congratulated on doing so. The money must, however, be properly applied, as we have to demand it of our taxpayers, who know that it must also be found within the framework of the Financial Perspective, and that the framework of the Financial Perspective will not come up with the money. They are urging that the Financial Perspective be cancelled. That we will not do under any circumstances. We will be in favour of sufficient funding being made available, in which respect the Commission proposal is a very good one that deserves to be taken seriously, and we unreservedly endorse it. We will insist that these funds be used in accordance with a UN mandate. We will support Commissioner Patten in his line, we will see to it that the debate on how the money is to be spent focuses on helping people to help themselves, for Iraq must get help, but we have had to help others in the past. Afghanistan did not get more than this; it got less. Iraq has the potential to be a rich country. Giving it more than we gave Afghanistan would be criminal; it would be to treat with disdain the other regions of the world that we supported in the past. Under no circumstances will a single vote of ours support this amendment. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have a budget before us which – contrary to what we otherwise hear about budget proposals – is shrinking, not growing. That may be a response to conditions in the Member States. Certainly, this budget is equipped with fewer resources. As a response to what is happening in the Member States, we must undoubtedly say: yes, we must manage the taxpayers’ money prudently, and as the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we will do that. However, we must also set priorities for the budget. That is something which we will certainly do. Let me start with an issue which – if Commissioner Schreyer is right, and I hope she is – will fall to us too as a task for the future. Let us talk about the revenue side of the EU budget. The revenue side – that means: where is the money coming from? Who pays? We pay from the taxpayers’ money. As we have observed, some estimates in Europe suggest that as much as twenty billion is being lost as a result of VAT fraud. Anyone who accepts this VAT fraud also accepts the shortfalls in revenue at European level. We are not prepared to accept that – because all these shortfalls must be made good out of the ordinary taxpayer’s pocket. During this budgetary procedure, we will therefore be proposing that the campaign against VAT fraud be stepped up in order to ease the burden on the ordinary taxpayer, so that the money that should be flowing to Europe can actually do so. We will have to debate this issue more often as part of the budget process from now on as well. In future budgetary procedures – including the next one – we will ensure that citizens can see for themselves that dependability is guaranteed as one of our fundamental values. This means dependability in combating the economic and social gap, and it means dependability in tackling unemployment. We have heard that the Council has slashed payments for the Structural Funds in particular. This raises a number of questions, in our view. On the one hand, the Member States are registering the substantial amounts of money which they intend to spend in the coming years, and especially next year. Yet at the same time, the Council has agreed, in its draft budget, that spending must be kept below these same figures. We wonder which of these figures is correct. We know that arrears have arisen in respect of commitments undertaken in the past, where payment has not yet taken place. The Council neatly sidesteps this issue and claims: ‘We don’t need the payments.’ We will not get involved in this game. Anyone reaching agreement, after tough negotiations, on the Financial Perspectives, especially in relation to the Structural Funds and therefore structural and economic development in the European Union, must also accept that when it comes to implementation, he will be reminded of his commitments and we will demand payment of the appropriate amounts. In the next budget year, we will take care to ensure that the European Union, as an economic area, is not just an economic area for major companies and corporations. We will push for intensive support for SMEs in future too. They are the backbone of the European economy. They are creative, innovative and willing to take risks, and we must give them our support so that even though they have no legal departments and no tax departments, they can benefit from the European Union and the internal market. Fourthly, in the budgetary procedure, we will ensure that enlargement is shaped on the basis of certainty. There have been various references already to the staffing issue. We will be looking very closely at what staffing levels are actually required in order to ascertain whether every one of the stated vacancies is genuinely needed. However, we will not allow enlargement and the accession countries to become the European Union’s piggy bank. I agree with all the previous speakers here. There must be equality. Decisions like this are the best indicators of whether or not equality genuinely exists. Anyone can voice noble intentions, but it is the decisions themselves that show whether there really is equal treatment, regardless of whether an old or a new Member State is involved. We will monitor this very carefully. In other areas too, we will continue to maintain continuity to some extent, but we will also have to shape our policy in a future-oriented way. This applies especially to foreign policy. Here, it has been our frequent experience in recent years that whenever a crisis situation develops anywhere in the world, we have responded in the heat of the moment and immediately pledged to make additional resources available, sometimes at the expense of established policies. If we look at some parts of the world which we supported in the past, we see that fewer resources are available than in previous years. We have had to restructure. We have done so because we have also recognised, of course, that we cannot increase the funding indefinitely. However, I would like to cite two statistics which, while not relating directly to our budget, do give us food for thought. Today, the United States of America and the countries of the European Union spend 460 billion every year on defence. 460 billion! Yet we spend just 37 billion on development. Is this really a forward-looking policy, one that is aimed at conflict prevention? Is it the kind of policy that developed states should be pursuing? The answer is ‘no’, which is why we want to develop European policy further within the bounds of what is possible – and that is modest enough. We want to work preventively. We want to develop conflict management strategies that will stop such conflicts from occurring in the first place. We are not so naive as to believe that there will be no more conflicts in the world. There will always be conflicts and our region, our Member States, must deal with that. Nonetheless, we will focus more intensively on prevention. A further area in which we must work preventively is demographic change. The European continent is changing dramatically. We see that the average population is ageing considerably, not only in individual countries but in all countries. That has an impact on all institutions and agencies. It not only means that there will, in future, be fewer kindergartens, or that we will need fewer kindergartens at local level. It will also have an impact on us. Let me once again give as an example the pensions burden, which we will have to shoulder. In many other areas, too, we will see that the numbers of young people are steadily dwindling and there are more and more older people. We must deal with this situation by shaping it positively. It should be viewed not as a threat but an opportunity. We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists will apply a number of criteria to this budget. The first is financial prudence, because we are dealing with our citizens’ money. The second is dependability. Everyone must see that what we start, we finish, and that we do not drag our feet or drop it half way through. The third is this: we will shape European policies in a way which enables us to work preventively instead of being caught on the hop when situations occur. We will endeavour to monitor developments early on, structure them appropriately and thus shape the European Union, our European continent, so that we have a good and secure future together.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the work she has done on this report and on the proposals that are on the table. We have just heard how the way we deal with packaging has a decisive part to play in shaping the future of our environment, and how there is – of course – a market in this field, one in which the big packaging groups are competing with one another, so that we have to give some thought as to how we achieve an optimum level of effectiveness. Within this market there are specialities, which represent the opportunities offered by diversity in Europe. Where these are concerned we have stressed the need for this great pot to safeguard the interests, futures and chances of survival of the small firms, scattered throughout Europe, working in the ceramics sector and producing highly-prized packaging such as that for Meaux mustard and similar goods. To describe them as an industry would be an exaggeration, in that they have between 30 and 50 workers each. It is for this reason that the keynote of our amendments is that the directive should not cover packaging materials which cannot be utilised for energy recovery owing to their material quality, which are inert, and the quantities of which do not exceed 0.1% of the proven quantity of packaging in the Community, and for which material or raw material recycling is ruled out for ecological and cost-benefit reasons. We have just heard from the Commissioner – and for this we are grateful – that the packaging directive’s recycling order will not apply to ceramics. There must, of course, be a place for ceramics in the packaging directive, but recycling it would mean that it would have to be transported back across Europe, in minimal quantities, in order for this to be done. Systems for its return, collection and recovery would have to be introduced. That would kill off small businesses. We cannot believe that Europe is about enacting directives that cut away the economic basis from under small firms that offer speciality goods that are highly prized in Europe. I thank you for your unambiguous statement, which is something we can build on, and which will also give the firms a certain amount of breathing space and a reliable prospect of future development.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his outstanding success in bringing together the interests of the committee and also in taking up the matters which are necessary for the conciliation procedure ahead and resisting the temptation to rewrite all the guidelines we wrote earlier this year. This is a report that is very cogent, very concentrated and which we very much support and welcome. The procedure which we shall now be entering in the next three weeks with the Council and the Commission will continue to exist for a short time. We hope, however, that it will soon be a thing of the past. If the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure were no longer made – and there is much in the Convention to suggest it will not be – then something Parliament has been advocating for many years would actually become reality and we would no longer need this advance mediation. That would be a good development and I hope we shall see it. Now to the individual points. So far as agriculture is concerned, a number of matters are raised here. I want to concentrate on a number of questions. First, the move to increase support for rural areas provided that there is a stronger focus on those areas in the new Member States than we had in the EU of the 15; we expressly welcome this. In view of the current debates – in Poland in particular, where ministers have resigned because they are evidently missing the opportunity to actually create the structures there that will allow the money to be used properly – I believe that all states must understand that no money can flow if the relevant structures are not in place. That must be made abundantly clear, and we shall be watching to see that the money is used according to the rules. All we can do is urge that the foundations be laid for it here. So far as insurance against eventualities such as disasters in agriculture is concerned, we are willing to look very closely at the survey and the expert report. Some Member States already have voluntary insurance for such contingencies. They would of course be penalised if the European taxpayer were to be called upon to cover these things elsewhere. We will examine this without prejudice and we are willing to act, but we will of course not go blundering blindly into anything either, because we have to know what the long-term consequences might be. So far as fisheries are concerned, I heard very clearly what Mrs Langenhagen had to say and we have always been prepared to support fisheries and the scrapping of ships where necessary. We are not, however, going to write any blank cheques, and we are not going to give a few million euros away in advance for a programme that has not been finally evaluated and on which the Council has not taken a position. We will do the same as we have done with other programmes in the past, such as scrapping in Portugal and Spain. In those cases, we wanted to have the full programme first and we said we would evaluate it and would then say how much would be made available for it. We will proceed no differently in this connection than we did with the Portuguese and the Spanish, even though we are now looking at other regions of Europe. We are in favour of increases on the common foreign and security policy. I would point out once again, however, that cooperation in peacekeeping is more than just peace enforcement as provided for in the Petersberg tasks of common foreign and security policy; it is also conflict prevention, and we do not support the envisaged reduction in appropriations. In this matter, we want to continue as before. Prevention is better than having to use military means to clear up afterwards. Finally, let me say something about the question of payment. The N+2 rule was introduced by us all and there was a point to it. Wanting to check whether it is right at this stage, before it has really come into play for the first time, is quite out of order. This N+2 rule must be applied, and those who fail to spend their money accordingly must know that there are consequences. Showing them a way out at this early stage would amount to killing the N+2 rule and we will not go along with that.

 I hereby declare that I have voted in favour of the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as I believe it to be essential that there should be, as soon as possible, a uniform statute with the same conditions applying to all Members of the European Parliament. This also means that major differences between the salaries of Members from the different Member States are unacceptable. In the European Parliament, as elsewhere, there must, in the medium term, be equal pay for equal work. I am, moreover, of the opinion that salaries must, as a matter of urgency, be made transparent – it is not acceptable that MEPs should have to use the reimbursement of travel expenses as a way of topping up their incomes. I will, nonetheless, not be availing myself of the rule’s provisions. I took my seat under the conditions that have prevailed to date, and I will, for my own part, continue to be subject to them.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the very good cooperation that we have already enjoyed over recent weeks. This is very early in the year to be setting down Budget lines, but the procedure has changed in such a way that we will always be doing this rather earlier in the future, which is not necessarily a disadvantage. If you see what discussions are going on at present in the European Union, you will know that, on the one hand, Europe is associated in the public mind with an enormous amount of hope, but that also, on the other hand, people are at present somewhat disconcerted by many aspects of it. The debates that we will be having this year, which will also have an influence on next year's Budget, will be on issues such as the Convention, enlargement, future economic progress, and the prospects for peace. It is also necessary that we, that Parliament, should be reliable in the work we do on the Budget, reliable as regards what we did in the past, and as regards what we want to carry forward into the future. Each individual issue has to be approached and discussed in a frank and transparent way. I have said in every Budget debate that we have to have equal rights in every area of the Budget, and I will stop saying this only when we actually are, and the Convention has a chance of making this happen and, in the Budget procedure too, even in matters of agricultural policy, of giving both parts of the budgetary authority equal powers. We have to ensure that transparency and clarity in matters concerning the European Budget are capable of being communicated to the public. We are on the threshold of enlargement. We want enlargement. The division of the continent of Europe into West and East, poor and rich, is a falsehood, but preparations for enlargement must be transparent, and the rationale behind them must be comprehensible, even when it comes to financial matters. Parliament is one of the two component parts of the decision-making authority, and we will not allow the Council to present us with faits accomplis
 in these matters. As far as Europe's economic development is concerned, many of those who have already spoken have said that we have to further develop the internal market – that internal market that many saw as pointing in the right direction and that raised their hopes; but unemployment in Europe is as much an issue now as ever it was. The means are available to us to do something about this. In recent years, we have refunded EUR 14 billion on one occasion, EUR 11 billion on another, and this year we will be refunding EUR 7 billion – resources that have not been used, in the Structural Funds for example, to combat unemployment. That is something we cannot accept. This tendency may have been alleviated somewhat, but it remains the case that far too much of the funds we have cannot be made use of. In order that we may make progress in this area, I ask you to take the simplification of administration further. As regards peace – both around the world and on the continent of Europe – it is only natural that we should take our past actions as the basis for future development, but, as it strives to develop a common foreign and security policy, Europe must not be understood to consist only of those who are currently engaged in developing joint military structures. Our approach must be that of avoiding and preventing conflicts and of disarming, as we have done with such things as landmines, and, if I may turn to developments in Palestine and Iraq, we are of course prepared to provide humanitarian aid there at a later date, but let nobody regard this as a licence to do whatever is possible on the basis that they can do their bit, and reconstruction can be left to the European Union. We have to make it abundantly clear that we are not giving anybody carte blanche. Now for the final point that I want to address. Europe is undergoing demographic change – and this is where we have to look slightly further ahead – in that it has an every-increasing number of older people and ever fewer young people. At European level, that will have an effect on pensions. We want all policies to be considered from the point of view of what these changes will mean in the future … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Commissioner, this is where I must again add something, as the fact of the matter will be that, when it comes to the accession treaties, this Parliament will have an approval procedure preventing us from saying anything more than yes or no. These accession treaties are, of course, binding in international law, and they also stipulate sums of money that would ordinarily, had we dealt with them together and subject to the conditions of the Financial Perspective, have been decided on in the codecision procedure, so that we could have gained some influence over the negotiations. If it is now assumed that the Copenhagen figures will be incorporated into the treaties and will be definitively laid down only in an approval procedure that is to take place very soon, there is, as you said, the de facto
 possibility of influencing the Financial Perspective in a codecision procedure involving the interested parties in the budgetary authority, or are we being thrown back on the ‘do or die’ position, in which we can only accept or reject? This notwithstanding the fact that it would go against the overall thinking behind the modus operandi 
devised as long ago as 1999. Now for my second question. You have announced your intention of creating a category of pre-accession aid that will, in future, include Bulgaria and Romania, and that aid will be increased. Bulgaria and Romania have for the past ten years already been going through a quite specific process covering individual aspects such as the implementation of the acquis communautaire
 and other such things. You have said that you have proposed that another state be included in this category of pre-accession aid, namely Turkey, which has not, to date, had a status comparable to that enjoyed by Bulgaria and Romania; nor are negotiations with Turkey anything like as far advanced as those with the other states. Are you now putting these countries on one and the same footing? Is the Commission proposing that we aim to give Turkey the same status as Bulgaria and Romania, and what can you adduce in support of this approach, involving as it does an assessment that goes far further than before? If we are talking in terms of pre-accession aid – and we have, in the past, heard various things from various sources, including that President Prodi is an advocate of Croatia and other Balkan countries getting candidate country status – are these countries already included in the category 7 that you are now providing for, or, if not, how are we going to be dealing with them over the coming years?

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, various aspects of the enlargement that lies before us are the subject of public debate, and one of them has to do with what the whole thing is costing. Can the advantages of enlargement really be expressed in euros and cents? Surely not! This enlargement will yield substantially more than can be communicated or depicted in sums of money. In any case, the whole process of European unification and cooperation between the peoples of Europe is something far greater than that, and bears no relation to the public conception of how much it all costs. I want to quote an example. What we spend on the European Union as a whole, on our work to promote research, economic prosperity, solidarity with others, young people, the protection of the environment, transport, the common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs policy amounts to some EUR 100 billion per annum. In 2001, EUR 125 billion were spent on defence within the European Union, and as much as EUR 133 billion this year. So which is better – to keep putting away money for defence or to press on with a peaceful development such as that which is offered as an opportunity for the continent of Europe? There is nothing romantic about financial issues. We cannot approach them solely with a fine image of a beautiful future in our minds; rather, we have to look at the facts of the situation and have frank discussions with the public, which knows that this is of course a challenge that will demand something of all of us. It was, however, a good sign that it became clear in Copenhagen, where negotiations about money had to be carried on under these difficult conditions, that you members of the Council were at least able to agree on a certain outline. You are of course aware that we, being the second arm of the budgetary authority, also have a part to play in all this. We will enter into a constructive and positive dialogue in order to deal with the relevant matters. We can take a positive approach to the initial evaluation of the Copenhagen financial resolutions. You have taken on board much of what we in this House had suggested. The financial package remains in a fixed framework, one that can be defended to the outside world without resorting to eloquent blandishments, but it still, of course, contains a few things that we need to talk about. There is the mysterious category X, which sounds like something menacing out of the X-Files or some such science fiction. We have to discuss what this is actually intended to do. We also have to talk about how things are to carry on after 2007 because you too have passed resolutions that go well beyond the financial perspective for the next two years. We have to have talks about this. This Parliament forms part of the budgetary authority. We will engage with you in a debate on these matters. Let me sum up, however, speaking also as a budget expert who is accustomed to keeping a very close eye on what money is spent, where it is spent, and how it is spent, by saying that we will take a very positive line on this enlargement as a whole. We will also put the Budget under the microscope and examine it very carefully. We will monitor what can be expected of our present Member States and of the candidate countries. What is important is that this European continent should have a sound foundation on which to grow together, and a sound foundation is also about sound financial provision, on which we will come to an understanding together.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is these speeches that remind us how close together we have been this year when dealing with specialised issues, as I believe that we are almost always discussing the same topics in this House, the very same ones that we are outlining now. I cannot, of course, stay out of this either, but I want to say something now, something to which the European public might perhaps be more determined to pay attention than it has been on repeated occasions over the past few years. Commissioner Schreyer referred to the rate of increase in the budget's commitments, which stands at 0.26%. Our budget does not show the rates of increase – let alone the rates of inflation – that were provided for in Berlin. We are well below them. In Berlin, the precaution was taken of creating a margin in order to make enlargement possible and easier. With a 0.26% increase, our present budgetary conduct brings us another step closer to that. Take a look at payments, and the figure of 1.9% does not, at first sight, appear to be very much. It is substantially less than what would be needed to reduce the debts that are still outstanding. Despite that, 1.9% is more than what is currently available to many national Finance Ministers to draw up their own budgets. Nonetheless, we stick with this 1.9%, because it is important. We have to consider this budget, and what it covers, as a whole. We have a budget of less than EUR 100 billion! That is 25% less than what the fifteen States of the European Union spend on defence. What we get for 25% less – in other words, for EUR 100 billion – is cooperation across Europe on environmental matters, in the field of research and development, and on cohesion, so that we do not leave the more vulnerable in the lurch. Agriculture is wholly europeanised, and preparations are being made for youth exchange activities. We are preparing for enlargement, we have a common foreign and security policy, and we collaborate on justice and home affairs. I believe that it has to be said loud and clear that we spend substantially less on all of these things, so as to give Europe a viable and peaceful future, than is spent at national level in the area of defence policy alone. Even though we have this tight budget and even though we have to take on new things with every passing year – as has already been said, there are new tasks in category IV almost every year – we nevertheless manage to set priorities that advance the economic development of the continent of Europe. Not only do we maintain and sustain a continent full of large corporations, but also the small and medium-sized enterprises on this European continent can make use of the opportunities offered by a shared internal market. They do not have their own departments to deal with tax or legal matters; what they need, in order to make the best use of this European internal market, with all its advantages, is help, and that is what we give. We respond to the ageing of society in the European Union. Our own financial planning still needs to take this more into account. I have already made repeated reference to pensions, but we want in future to respond to the ageing of European society as a whole. One very major priority has been and still is category IV. I read a newspaper report today, which stated that the European Parliament did not regard the fight against Aids as important. Let me point out now that Parliament has quadrupled the sum of money originally proposed to be allocated for this purpose. Anyone who claims that we do not attach enough importance to this has no idea what he is talking about. I would like again to emphatically underline the great progress that this year's budget procedure has enabled us to make. I can follow on seamlessly from where Mr Ferber left off. There are parliamentary gaps that we need to close in this area, gaps that have to do with the monitoring of policies that are being moved from the national to the European level, and we are finding out where they are. We have managed to achieve a joint declaration with the Council, which makes considerable progress precisely in the area of security and defence policy, making it clear to the public that the European Parliament has no room for manoeuvre on European policies at European level. These are matters that will have to be resolved in the Convention, that really need to be organised elsewhere. Even so, we have already tackled them. Mrs Schreyer, you have already acted as if all of this were already in the bag. We will of course scrutinise the Copenhagen conclusions, but what is in any case clear is that this is not just an issue to be resolved in Copenhagen by the Council, but one that we should be discussing among ourselves in this House. Although our attitude is very positive, your dogmatic ‘and so it was decided’ is something I cannot leave unchallenged. That can only be said when discussions have gone well and been concluded. I wish to thank all of my fellow Members of this House, especially the two rapporteurs and the President, who has been patient enough to allow me an extra thirty seconds. (Applause)
Walter (PSE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would of course like to thank our two rapporteurs. Parliament has had what you might call a Swedish experience, and I think that it has been a good experience. It has been very much geared towards consensus and has been imaginative and flexible in equal measure, and has for once closely examined structural aspects. I am sure that this Budget procedure also has structural side effects that need to be very carefully examined. From this perspective, I would also like to make the following comment: we have heard several times that this is the last Budget for just 15 Member States before enlargement. But I hope that it is also one of the last Budgets before the convention secures full budget rights for this House, in the medium term at least, in relation to all types of expenditure policy and income policy. That is a request that we have made. You know that I have repeated this request during every Budget procedure; it has become a familiar refrain. I think it is important that we should help to democratise the Budget procedure here. The hallmark of the Budget as we draw it up at present is that heated debates rage during the budget-setting process around every million, sometimes even every thousand euros, yet during the year we often have to shift funds around and restructure the Budget. This year alone we will probably draw up six supplementary and amending budgets. We will have between 70 and 80 carry-overs, which means that a great many appropriations will have to be moved around. Not only this year, but also in previous years, both during the budget procedure and right at the end of the year we have had to resort to frontloading in order to finance things that strictly speaking fall in the following year. We also demonstrate by means of this pragmatic approach that we are prepared to finance essential aspects of European policy, and that although we set a Budget at the beginning of the year, there is so much flexibility and room for manoeuvre that at the end of the year the Budget is no longer as reliable as might have been wished and assumed at the outset, when we were discussing certain issues so forcefully. That means that this form of budget setting at the very least needs reflecting upon. We should take this into account in the coming weeks, months and years when we are further developing our budget policy. As the Commissioner has said, the 2003 Budget is a thrifty one. We will be spending just 1.05% of GNP to tackle all the tasks facing the European Union. If you look at the position of those countries that are net contributors, which are so often the subject of debate, you will find that the biggest net contributors pay no more than 0.3 to 0.7% of their GNP. That ranges from 0.3% for my own country and 0.7% of GNP, to finance this European policy. 0.3% for Germany! So much for the heated debates that we are always having about how expensive this is all supposed to be! In the context of the Budget, we try to husband our resources carefully. We try to ensure that balances are maintained. That will be a job for the future – starting with balances in this continent. We need a financially balanced Europe in the long term. We need to make sure that our institutions are capable of functioning, not forgetting the prospect of enlargement, and also bearing in mind the maturing process that our institutions and the European Union as a whole are going through. These are long-term tasks. We need to ensure that people in Europe who place their trust in us can rely on financial balance and are not taken unawares by short-term changes. I would like to make this point very specifically in the case of agriculture, but it also applies to regional policy. We are also interested in seeing reform of our regional policy and in unblocking the backlog of appropriations still to be executed. I would, however, like to say this, Commissioner: it is not enough for Commissioner Barnier to examine how Structural Fund bureaucracy can be dismantled. That is something that applies to all the EU support programmes. I would be pleased if the other Commissioners affected were to behave in the same way. We therefore need to strike a balance in our continent. But we as Europeans also need a balance between continents, because we are not just a fortunate island; we also have to think about relations between the continents. In the past we have repeatedly used our external policy to help other regions of the world. This has become ever more difficult, because new tasks have been added to the ones we originally embarked upon: financing, reconstruction, the Balkans, financing reconstruction in Afghanistan, and also the enormous task of improving world health, not least the battle against AIDS. That is not just an issue in Africa, it affects the whole world and that includes our own continent. Money needs to be earmarked for that. There is a lot we could say about financing, Mrs Schreyer, but there is no denying that we have a responsibility here that we need to shoulder. It is hard to do all this. Category 4 has caused us major headaches this year, just as in previous years. We have to be flexible if we want to solve all the world's problems. But there is one thing we need to be clear about: Europe's citizens can rest assured that we will protect their interests in this continent. However, we are also keen to ensure that our continent occupies an appropriate position in the world as a whole. We intend to set budgets in conjunction with you in a thrifty and sound way but at the same time with an eye to the future. (Applause)

. – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those of us who sit on the Committee on Budgets have had a truly great task laid on our shoulders, and I am both glad and grateful that there is one thing that has so far on this occasion become abundantly clear. It is a matter of common knowledge that this is, on the one hand, about getting very diverse things done very quickly because people really are waiting for assistance after having undergone something that we can scarcely imagine. On the other hand, we would have to toil our way through three complicated subject areas if we were actually to be able to do something that will be equal to the pressures of the future. For a start, we have to create a legal basis; one is in place today. We have today already been engaged in negotiations about it, and have had discussions about it in a very good atmosphere. I believe we will be able to come to an agreement. The Committee on Budgets attached primary importance to the need to embody all this in an Interinstitutional Agreement. We have to take care that we do not only give people the impression that we are now able to give aid with all speed, but must at the same time make it robust enough for it to last, to fit into the overall framework, to stand the test of time, and ensure that others affected at a later date may know that there are some things on which they can rely. What we must not do is again dangle a carrot before them and then later have to say that there is no basis capable of supporting what we want to do. We have therefore put the emphasis on three things. The legal basis must be decided on as soon as possible, and so we have cooperated very constructively with the Committee on the Regions, to which I am very grateful for having taken the majority of our amendments on board. Today, the Interinstitutional Agreement is as good as concluded, but just one small problem remains. The Commission must, as soon as possible, propose a supplementary and amending budget in which the money – the EUR 1 billion of which we are speaking – is actually made available as quickly as possible, and an appeal can be made to the Member States to produce the figures with all speed so that we can make progress on this. In our budgetary capacity, we have agreed that we want, in future, to hold out this EUR 1 billion at least as an offer. We will work together with everyone else as quickly as possible, but it must also be clear that we will do this as thoroughly as possible. My present optimism is founded on my past experience, in this House, of cooperation across all national boundaries, without regard to political allegiances, between the committees and also between the institutions – Parliament, the Council, and the Commission. I believe that the people of Europe can know that here there is real cooperation with human beings in mind. We, who, in our budgetary capacity are otherwise meant to focus our attention more or less exclusively on money, now know how valuable the human dimension is. There is now a need to provide assistance as quickly as possible, here and now, in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and, in future, also in regions which in the past sometimes felt that we, unfortunately, could not really meet their needs adequately. (Applause)
Walter (PSE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me also, on behalf of my group, in this new sort of debate – not indeed the only one, as we will be having another in October on the substantive votes – set before you our position, our approach and our concerns. I wish to make reference to the great challenges before us, which have just been described. I have great confidence in the work of our two general rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, who have previously shown their capacity for excellent work. In managing the workload over the coming months and weeks, it is on their shoulders that we are standing. The greatest challenge is enlargement, which has already been referred to many times, and which marks a fundamental change in this European Union of ours. The European Union will, in two years' time, have an appearance quite different from any it has had before, which will not only have an effect on financial matters, but will also bring cultural changes in its wake. All this will need proper preparation. Here in Parliament, we will, whilst taking up our respective positions, have to show openness – freedom and openness to the acceptance of others, of new ideas and new impetus. This must also show itself in the budget. Secondly, we have experienced in recent weeks, which started with a vast catastrophe striking Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, followed by other regions of the European Union, that we are inadequately prepared for the disasters that can afflict our continent. It is not enough to give assistance only in cases of emergency, although thank God this assistance will now be financially resourced in such a way that we are not only giving people the impression that we can help them, but are actually able to provide aid efficiently and effectively. No, it is not enough to help only when something has happened; we have to take preventive action. We have to work together on early warning systems, on research into environmental changes, in order to be able to prepare ourselves, rather than, like a rabbit fixated by a snake, waiting for the worst to happen, but getting to grips with it early on, in order to see what can be prevented right from the outset. Thirdly, there is the issue of work creation. This continent still has too many people unemployed. Although this is one of the richest continents in the world, people are forced to remain unemployed even though we have vast amounts of money to use to counter unemployment. I speak, of course, with particular reference to the Structural Funds, but I also have others in mind. It must be possible to guarantee greater efficiency, and the faster and more efficient distribution of resources. We have proposed an efficiency force to shed light on all the bureaucratic apparatus, enabling us to act quicker and get money to where it is really needed so that people gasping for breath in the tangled bureaucratic undergrowth do not sink back in despair and say they can do no more. We also have to ensure that this EU of ours plans for the long term, with regard to staff expenses as much as to anything else. Thank God our staff are relatively young, but we have to finance all their pensions out of the budget. If we want to plan for the long term here, we have to make an early start on ensuring that funds are put by for this purpose so that we can give help in this area, or else we will run into major problems, at any rate further down the road. There are initiatives that have been in place since 1996, but which have not to date been implemented. That is something we have to get to grips with. We must help small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union to have their share of economic development. Success in this European Union of ours must not be the preserve of the big firms that can afford their own legal departments and tax departments; it must be put within the reach of small enterprises and micro-businesses. We have submitted amendments on that subject. In these discussions, you will find us to be willing to work constructively with you. Other amendments have been tabled, but I wanted to set out the focal points of our approach. Thank you for your attention. (Applause)
Walter (PSE

Mr President, honourable Members, large-scale disasters such as that which struck a month ago are indeed ill winds of sadness, anxiety and pain but they often also bring some good. That good may be that people feel closer, feel drawn together and that we are all pulling in the same direction. Cooperation experienced in a European context does more in hard times than endless lofty speeches and we have seen here – and my congratulations first and foremost to the Commission on how it has kicked into action – that the European Union, which is often perceived as inflexible, is keen to show how flexible it can be by earmarking Structural Fund resources, by paying out aid to farmers, by implementing rules for funds available from Europe, by applying a flexible aid regime, i.e. where funds are not channelled directly, and by being flexible in its competition requirements. And this sends out a good message, a message that, when it has to, Europe can get moving. We have our work cut out for us. The Council and Parliament now need to hand out fast, solid aid. Fast aid because the dikes which have been inundated will not hold up forever. Help is needed. And solid aid because permanent help is needed and, may I say here loud and clear, that the proposed aid fund, which has our full and unwavering support, is clearly not designed to be a quick fix for a few months or a one-off incident. Anyone who has witnessed how two countries which, economically, are usually among the strongest in Europe, have received expressions of solidarity from countries which are not among the strongest will never again be able to refuse these regions help if disaster threatens in the future. I say that in the light of what we have done in the budget in previous years. Unfortunately, there was never enough money available to really be able to help. Basically, all we did was to raise hopes and then dash them again. This must not happen with the aid fund and we shall need to act accordingly. We need, however, to address a number of issues which go beyond these emergency measures. We need to deal with these issues in the Committee on Budgets and we shall be looking here for close contact and close cooperation with the Commission and the Council in order to get things moving as quickly as possible. But we also need to take account in our calculations of experience in formulating policies in other areas. Satellite data on flood management need to be included in the framework research programme, as does seismic research, because we are not just talking water here, we are also talking earthquakes – think of the Azores. We need to think about how to impose mandatory specifications to ensure buildings are stable. We also need to think very carefully about straightening rivers and about flood plains. And urgent help is needed. In the medium term, we need to create a solid basis for future help from the European Union – including financial help – and take preventive measures across the whole of the political spectrum which concerns us. Only then will help be credible, because only then will people take us seriously and, even then, we must not promise more than we can deliver. I should like to thank everyone who has helped and I trust we shall pull together over the coming weeks and months in order to carry out the work in hand. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I speak as someone who is involved with setting the Budget, and people in that position sometimes have the feeling that they have to start by saying very clearly that we, too, who are involved with the financial side of enlargement, are in complete support of that enlargement. We know it is not only a question of money; it goes far beyond that. It is a question of peace on this continent, a question of standards, a question of security for the people who live all over this continent. If we are to meet a challenge as great as the one before us, we must not only have the political will, but we must also ensure that the policies we make are backed by those for whom we make them, namely the people. That means they must have confidence, and confidence exists when they have the feeling that things are also being handled in a proper and orderly way when it comes to funding these issues. In that connection we must say that this enlargement will demand something of everyone. Those who dream of advancing without any difficulties through landscapes in bloom fail to understand the matter. We want to subject the financing of enlargement to very precise tests, which means that we are not issuing any blank cheques for the acceding countries, but we do not want to set up any hurdles either. We very much welcome what the Commission has proposed. In the matter of the structural funds, one of the areas where most expenditure is made, we are pleased that it has followed the approach taken by Parliament and intends to adopt a Regulation similar to what we are doing with the cohesion fund in order to make it easier for the candidate countries to absorb the funds. But we also say very clearly at this point that this model is a model for transition. We will not be creating a cohesion fund here that, in the future, will give rise to another model or to another fund that will then never run out but, insofar as it is possible to move over to the normal structural fund, that is what we shall have to do. In the area of agricultural aids we support the Commission. We agree that the rural areas should be seen as targeted units. We also believe that direct aids are now part of agricultural incomes and that up until 2006 there is a simple model that can be funded, is clear and that we can also support. For the time after that we shall have to give thought to how it is to look. There are no blank cheques today, because we know the financial framework only up to 2006. At this point we can guarantee full support. After that, it will be necessary to think again. But that also demands something of those conducting the negotiations. We will give them very critical but constructive support. We take a similar position on foreign policy. Anyone looking at future developments in external aid must count on things happening that cannot be foreseen today. As an example I will simply mention Kaliningrad. Here we shall of course also be subjecting the European Union’s external aids to very critical scrutiny, but we are very much convinced that this is possible and that, here, too, we will be able to make progress accordingly. Citizens can be assured that between now and 2006 there will be no discernible problems. For the time after that there will have to be proper negotiations. All who sit round the table carry a heavy responsibility. As a Parliament we will have a part in deciding how things will move forward, and we will be looking at that very closely. But we will also be following these questions very positively because we believe that European Union enlargement is the task of the future to which we must apply ourselves, where everyone must know where we are heading, where we must first talk about how much we are prepared to pay, but we will always take a constructive and positive attitude, as we have up until now.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the supplementary and amending budget on which we are to decide today is one that will surely please the Finance Ministers, as they will be getting EUR 10.5 billion back. On the basis of mutual trust, we have withdrawn the amendments we tabled at first reading stage. We have to rely on the measures the Council has taken, and the Council can have confidence in our procedures. We have also done this because Commissioner Schreyer said last time that the funds we had reinstated could not be utilised. We cannot but wonder, though, why the funds are flowing at no better a rate than we find here. We have a total of EUR 113 billion left over, EUR 82 billion alone in the area of the Structural Funds, and, quite apart from this, EUR 11.4 billion in the area of internal affairs policy and EUR 12.9 billion in the area of category 4. In the long run, this cannot be tolerated. Having already spent many years lamenting the arrears that have to be reduced, we have to come up with something a bit more definite. The question is whether the late entry into force of some of the programmes adopted actually has anything to do with it. The question also arises of whether the form in which we allocate these funds, with the amount of bureaucracy required, does not in many instances prevent the appropriation of money that the European taxpayer has made available in order to improve the situation of many people in Europe. I speak for the Social Democrats in suggesting that we, over the coming weeks, should push for a joint efficiency force, and I ask the Commission, in particular, to play its part in this. Such an efficiency force would be composed of people from outside – experts in administration and management, and also experts from the Court of Auditors, because the whole set-up has of course to be run properly if we want to work more efficiently, more quickly and with less bureaucracy. These outsiders will have to submit proposals to us concerning how the relevant application procedures might be improved. This should involve us making relevant enquiries of, for example, officials of the Commission who are affected, the national and regional partners, businesses and organisations, and the regional banks, who have a role to play in the allocation of funding. The Euro Info Centres, which have a lot of expertise at their disposal, should also be involved. We must aim, not to start by getting this money into the European Budget and then return it, but to actually allocate it to the practical policies that we decided on. In doing this now, we must act with greater determination than in the past. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, it is a fact that the beginning of every year, or a day relatively soon after it, finds us facing the same procedure as today's. One could get the impression that, for the Finance Ministers, Easter means great big Easter eggs from Europe, which take the form of returned funds, which of course take some pressure off the national budgets, and on which we in this House have to take decisions at the beginning of each year. As has already been said far more than once, with this Supplementary and Amending Budget we will be talking about EUR 10 billion, and the EUR 2 billion that have as good as been announced are yet to be put in front of us. We must, though, remember that at the end of last year we repaid EUR 1.2 billion, whether on a one-off basis or in anticipation, which means that for this one year we are talking about over EUR 13 billion in unused resources. In the same way, at the end of every year, when Christmas is approaching, we do not necessarily have Christmas presents for Parliament, and each time we have to fight to raise small amounts that are not allocated to important political tasks. Over the last three years we had Kosovo, where we really had to fight hard to end up with any money at all. This had to do with Serbia, it had to do with aid for fisheries in the southern parts of this EU of ours – in Spain and Portugal – and we even had to dig into our emergency reserves in order to guarantee the continuing reconstruction of the Balkans last year. Yet today's backflow is not really cause for rejoicing, as it only means that there are resources that have not been utilised. This can mean that the programmes for which they were intended were not there, or that serious work was not done in the Member States, or that the options for giving help to the public have not been sufficiently exhausted. What it does mean in any case is that all of what has been announced must at some point or other be implemented, and every one of today's payment reimbursements is a burden for the future, because, if it is not paid out today, it will be paid out at some point in the future, and so only limited rejoicing is called for. I think that we have to make it clear that this is not really helping. As long as two years ago, I suggested on one occasion that, instead of letting all the money be returned, we should put some – 10% of the returnable resources, for example – into, as it were, a reserve or emergency fund. That would, for a start, be another way of going about things. Funds would not be constantly moved back and forth, so we would, instead, be able to make rather more reliable plans, and it would also help us to move forward in other areas. Supplementary and Amending Budgets can be talked about and looked at from many different angles, this one being one of them. We in Parliament intend to amend the Supplementary and Amending Budget in such a way that a substantial amount does not go straight back to the Member States. We have just heard that there are payments that have to be made in many areas, with past commitments having to be met. In the coming days and weeks, we will be intensively seeking discussions with the Council. We will pay precise attention to how amenable to discussions the Council is, and to how openly it deals with us. I do think we can find good solutions to this. We must all be aware that cooperation means that all are ready to talk to each other. That is as much the case as regards the Supplementary and Amending Budget as it is in the Budget procedure. We are ready, but we are also prepared for very intensive discussions with each other and, if need be, for an in-depth exchange of arguments.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union is an endeavour – an endeavour for 500 million people on this continent, people in the EU's fifteen Member States, but also in the countries that want to join them in it. In contrast to what you have said, Mr Verheugen, it is not an effort that we have to make now and which we can no longer get out of, but an endeavour that we want to engage in because we want to create a future Europe that will be a community of solidarity in that future generations can work in peace with one another and with economic success on sound social foundations and under optimum conditions from the point of view of the environment. Such an endeavour must be worth something to us – not only in terms of what we ourselves, or politicians, put into it, not only in terms of drumming up people's support, but also in terms of figures in black and white, by which the project must be backed up; it means that we also, of course, have to give thought to how we can set out, including in financial terms, the individual steps that must be taken. That is not just a fear on the part of the public, but an important issue. As a householder myself, I, naturally, pay a great deal of attention to that. We have just heard that we will be able to cope with all that within the framework of the Perspective that was adopted in Berlin in 1999. All of what the Commission has presented will indeed last us until 2006. There are though, a few things in all these columns of figures that we need to discuss. Mr Verheugen referred to one of them himself. It is expecting too much of the new countries who will be added that they should be net contributors from the very outset. You cannot demand that countries whose gross domestic product is certified as being only 50% of that of the existing Member States, that they should start out as net contributors, for the precise reason that payments have to be effected directly, whilst repayments would be made only after a period of time had elapsed. In this financial perspective, we have described pre-accession aid packages that, in the first instance at any rate, worked on the assumption that new countries would be added with immediate effect from 2002. However, they have not been, but, spread over the years, the EUR 3 billion remain the same. If ten countries actually are added in 2004, the EUR 3 billion left over would be for two countries, Bulgaria and Romania. We will have to discuss what is actually meant by this and how it has to be implemented. Finally, we must think about how things are to go on after 2006, for you cannot simply say that this will be enough until 2006, and that we will just carry on after that date. You mentioned that the Structural Fund and the Agricultural Policy are in the ratio of 75:25. In our current Budget, the ration is 45:35, in favour, let it be noted, of the Agricultural Policy. We cannot make such massive changes to it that it will be as you have just said by that date. What this means is that we must discuss in precise terms how we go on from here. We will monitor that during the Budget very constructively, but with a highly critical eye. Mr President-in-Office, this morning you introduced this topic for us. With all respect for you and your office, I have a request to make. In the whole of your speech, you did not once mention Parliament as being a fellow-player in connection with these enlargement negotiations. We are legislators on the Budget every bit as much as the Council. It would be good if the way you conduct business were to take us into account. (Applause)
Walter (PSE

 Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, let me, of course, start by thanking both our rapporteurs for the work they have done, which is outstanding. I would like to take today's debate on the guidelines as an opportunity to pause and do a sort of interim report. We have completed the first half of our parliamentary term, and when we recall the tasks that faced us at its outset, what had to be funded by the Budget, what was made available to us and what we allocated to others, we see that the world has, of course, changed a great deal. We have to deal with the problems of the world, which are not without their effects on us. Europe has closed ranks, and we stand alongside the world. We have taken on hitherto unmanageable tasks, and there are yet others for us to take on. The field of foreign policy has been mentioned: extensive aid for reconstruction in the Balkans, aid for Afghanistan and for the people persecuted and harassed there, the fight against the global scourge of AIDS, the disarmament measures that we need to reduce not only the number of landmines but also chemical and biological weapons, and also, for example sending a police task force to the Balkans to ensure that peace can enter there. The field of home affairs and judicial policy has, of course, see us agree, in the aftermath of the events of 11 September, to strengthen Europol and Eurojust and speed up their introduction; one of the Commission's new proposals is the expansion of civil protection in the event of emergencies. In the Convention, we are discussing cross-border structures and future developments. In the field of home affairs and judicial policy, we are discussing immigration and how to control it. Enlargement has been described as a problem area, and in it we have a number of things to sort out both internally and externally; whilst Mr Ferber says that there are calls to rethink the relationship between Categories 7 and 8, we must also note that, as opposed to the original estimates, on the basis of which we assumed that the first six States could be added as early as 2002, this position has of course changed, and that is something we have to be allowed to discuss. We, too, see of course that there is a lack of uptake, and, where too little is taken up, we must not heap up even more. Budgeting is not about demanding more; it is about making proper use of the taxpayers' available resources. There is a need, though, to take note of realities as well; everyone – including those Members of this House who even want to bake bigger cakes – has described the points we want to discuss together in order not to stage enlargement as a sort of cataclysm with the expectation of dramatic overnight change; rather, we have to prepare ourselves. We have to prepare the countries, and part of that involves, of course, our making appropriate provision and discussing it. The capacity for taking the right decisions presupposes that we talk about them. It is, in my opinion, irresponsible to simply stand up and say, for whatever simplistic reasons, that ‘we cannot even think about that’. In the last few years, we have had to move reform of the Commission forward, but we also have internal problems that have to be discussed further. The combating of unemployment must not be forgotten; it is one of our central tasks, and one in which the cooperation procedure has of course enabled us to make progress already. We want to prevent social exclusion. We want to promote technological development and, to that end, to make promotional funds available for ‘e
-learning’ and the new technologies. These great challenges, which have arisen in recent years, do not find us in a state of fear. We face this challenge with a confidence which we want to make visible. It is a good thing that this European Union of ours is working together, that we are increasingly trying to present a composite picture to the world we want to work with. We are not sitting here or standing up and simply calling for more money. We must look closely to find what options we have in this Budget. This is, of course, something that any serious housekeeper must do, but we must also highlight the fact that we have other things to do; if they are to work, if, on the one hand, the poor are not to be victims, if we want to help others who endure persecution, then we have to give some thought to how we treat each other. This is not a demand for more money on tap; it is about the purposeful use of money. We have to look carefully at where our money is being spent. Is the best possible use being made of it? If not, then we must redirect it, and apart from that nothing should be declared to be unthinkable. It is not more money that we want, but its purposeful use, and we seek the resources that are needed for Europe to continue to develop in the way constantly, and rightly, called for in all their resolutions by members of the European People's Party.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we have to vote on a supplementary and amending budget which, without doubt, is, and will remain, unique in the history of this Parliament, for we are negotiating a figure which amounts to 0.005% of the European Union budget and have even arranged a debate specifically for this purpose. We asked Commissioner Schreyer to appear before this House to discuss the reports and the action we are taking. There is good reason to discuss these matters, for they concern the financing of the Convention. This House pushed harder than any other European institution for the setting up of the Convention; we promoted and demanded it. We demanded it because we believe it is necessary to develop and introduce new procedures in Europe in order to improve interinstitutional relations and the interdependence between the three institutions. This means that there must be mutual respect, an awareness of roles, and transparency. The Spanish Presidency's initial proposal on the management of the funds necessary for the financing of the Convention alarmed us all, for it stipulated that the Council alone would provide the money, administer it and – above all –monitor how it is spent. It made no reference at all to Parliament! Of course, under no circumstances can this be a precedent for future relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Committee on Budgets and this House firmly rejected this model. In doing so, we had to adopt an accelerated procedure as there was no time to follow our usual procedure. Indeed, we had to involve coordinators to discuss the matter. We could not even make proper preparations within the Committee on Budgets. Nonetheless, we did so because we were keen to ensure that the Convention could be launched tomorrow. What this House has achieved is to ensure that in conformity with our powers, we are now part of the budgetary authority as regards the allocation of funds. We are one of the two elements of the budgetary authority whose task is to decide on the allocation of funds. Transfers of funds can only be carried out with our consent, which is also necessary for the granting of discharge. This gives rise to other issues and we have discussed these as well. In the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the solution identified is a good one. We have, however, gone one better, for our colleagues from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control have added an extra dimension, which is all to the good. We will certainly ensure that the procedure adopted for the Convention, and the implementation of this procedure, do not become a blueprint for any other institutions which may be set up at European level at any time in the future. One existing institution – namely Coreper – will assume a function which has not been assigned to it at all at European level. It will be the body to which Parliament, the Council and the Commission grant the right to consent to discharge. It is astonishing: the Council will grant consent for the discharge of Coreper – one of its own institutions! This is very bizarre. This will not be a blueprint for any future arrangements in the European Union, and the discharge procedure will not be carried out on this basis in any other context. We will vigorously resist any moves in this direction. Parliament will defend its rights, and we will monitor developments very closely. However, we will vote in favour of the report tomorrow because we recognise that the Convention must be able to start its work. It is important to send out a positive signal to Europe by demonstrating that we are no longer applying the old procedures but are adopting a new approach, a new direction, and are shaping the future of Europe!

Madam President, a brief parenthesis to remove the spanner from the works: we reached an agreement which, from Parliament's point of view, was perfect as far as development policy output targets are concerned. But we do not to spell it out again in the resolution in question, so we are withdrawing Amendment No 1. We believe that Parliament has made excellent progress within the budget on this point and Amendment No 1 is therefore no longer necessary.
Walter (PSE

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my thanks to Carlos, Kathalijne, Francesco, Esko, Joane and Terry. It is they, of course, who have provided us with these documents for today’s debate, and I believe they have done an outstanding job. The result we shall obtain from all of this will be a very good one. Allow me at this point, I spoke out of turn last time, to address Mr Vande Lanotte, the representative of the Council. After Mrs Parly last year, you are the second President of the Council whom I shall remember with profound gratitude. If this trend continues in the coming years, if this level is consistently maintained, we shall yet manage to establish really close cooperation and mutual trust one of these days between the Council and Parliament. Keep an eye on us, Commissioner – you must treat us better, otherwise you will suddenly find that we are far more in tune with them than with you. The point I wish to put to the President-in-Office, however, concerns Laeken. As I have already remarked, one of the things you will be discussing in Laeken, naturally enough, is the future structure of the European Union, and this discussion will not be confined to the question of a constitution in the sense of defining the structure and purpose of each component of the Union. No, we must also talk about the way in which we can achieve a budget that is transparent in every respect. It is impossible to explain to any of our citizens the fact that, having underspent various allocations by 4.6 billion euros, as the Commissioner said, we should be fighting for weeks and months here to obtain an extra 200 million or, when acute emergencies occur, that we actually have to push the entire budget back and forth to deal with them at the expense of our long-term strategies and basic political aims. We have had to make a large amount available for Afghanistan this year, and indeed it is very important that the people there do not merely see Europe as an authority that comes to punish but that they also experience Europe as a helper coming to assist them in their development. We have allocated aid to the fishing regions and aid to the border regions. This, too, was very important, because it signalled to the world that we are taking the current changes seriously and that we are restructuring in response to them. Allow me a brief remark in parenthesis. Time and again, as we all know, the cry from Bavaria has been that we need money for the border regions. These are the selfsame Bavarians who, on other occasions, denounce the system of revenue redistribution among the Länder
 and who, in CDU and CSU papers on structural issues, advocate the scrapping of all structural aid. On such occasions they turn round and demand a great deal more money. I have been a very fervent supporter of assistance for border regions and shall continue to support it, but those who beat the drum with high-powered press releases must ask themselves whether this is a consistent way to act. We also have fundamental matters to deal with. We must forge ahead with the reform of the Commission, because we want a modern administrative system. We must forge ahead on e-
learning, one of the areas with the highest growth potential in a developing economic area like the European Union, not only because we want to grasp our economic opportunities but also because we want to avoid a split within our populations between those who can afford to acquire computers at a very early stage and those who are excluded from the information society. We must cooperate more effectively in Europol and Eurojust to combat terrorism. We cannot have a situation in which the criminals are driving Ferraris and the police are trying to chase them in Fiat Unos! I mention these two makes of car deliberately, because they come from a certain country, a country that would do well to consider what it is doing to Europe at the present time. In the domain of foreign policy too, we must agree to tackle important issues. The Balkans must continue to receive attention. So must the Mediterranean region. But we must also heed the silent agony of the voiceless in the world. This is why we have been active this year in the struggle against AIDS. Silent agony, however, is easily neglected. We must keep closer watch. We must not wait to be rocked by violent explosions in the world. On the contrary, the European Union must become more sensitive, in cooperation with the regions of the world where our help is needed, especially to the need for food aid to ward off starvation but also to the need to help the countries in those regions to improve their administrative systems and infrastructure, thereby guaranteeing that those countries can develop by their own efforts in a manner which reflects credit on the quality and diligence of European cooperation with the rest of the world. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking most sincerely the three rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Costa Neves and Mr Seppänen, for the work they have put in. Anyone who follows the process as intensively as the coordinators sometimes do, can see how much work is actually involved. Hence my special and wholehearted thanks on behalf of all my group. I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council is still here, as I think every year's Budget process must bring with it the opportunity to point out one thing: this Budget process is not complete. Its ability to contribute notwithstanding, this Parliament is not yet in full and complete possession of the power that citizens' Parliamentary representatives must have when the budget for the coming year is at issue. I have hinted that I will say that over and over again. I will do as Cato the Elder did to the ancient Romans – he was the one who wanted to see Carthage destroyed – but perhaps I will not go quite that far. I desire only the destruction of an undemocratic process and I will always be reminding you of that. This Budget process, even as regards the agricultural budget, is complete only when it has got us well and truly on board, and when we have complete responsibility for receipts and outgoings. I know that I am not meeting with much resistance on your part, but of course we have to develop this further in discussion and argument. Only then will the citizens of the European Union be able to decide by their votes whether we, this Parliament, have done well or not. (Applause)
 The Council and the Commission must of course have a part in this process in future. We will accord them high honour for it. I believe, though, that Parliament, being composed of elected representatives, is the primary partner in dialogue. We will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here. We are working on Budget matters in a very restricted framework, which itself is prescribed by the Financial Perspective, to which we adhere, even though we see that additional demands are made on us which were not recognisable as such at the time the Financial Perspective was adopted. We must adapt to this and facilitate further developments within our Budget framework. At present that is surely still possible, for we see from the backdraughts at the end of every year that there is still enough air. So, either there is not proper implementation – a fault which will have to be tackled – or the items really were estimated too high. Even there it is still possible to let some air out. I will tell you though, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, that we will in the foreseeable future – in other words by the expiry date of this Financial Perspective at the latest – have to talk about further developments. When it comes to the further development of the Financial Perspective, we will have to do some thinking about much more intensive and definite ways of meeting new challenges. Up until then, we will have been letting air out all over the place. We will be back on the launch pad, and will have to discuss what appropriate terms for this House's budget and the Budget as a whole might look like. We will be ready to energetically dispute over further developments with you. On the road to this destination, we will give the Commission the support it needs when it comes to modernising its administrative procedures. We will be at its disposal when needed staff are to be taken on. But, on the contrary, we will also be making quite massive demands. We will be demanding a great deal so that our programmes, which we cast in numerical form in the Budget, actually come into being in the course of the year. No longer will we stand by and watch payment arrears being built up. Progress is being made – I will admit that here and now. I certainly would not claim that we are where we were two or three years ago. But despite this progress, there is still a need for a massive amount of further work. As I have said, we will support you, but we will also make demands. In the area of individual Budget lines and categories, too, we will hold fast to that which has proved its worth. The people who rely on us to give support when it is needed, will be able to rely on us in future too. That starts in Category I, with the farmers who cannot change everything around from one day to another, but need a certain headstart. These people must also know that there is to be a change in this European Union. We, as a Parliament, will help to bring it about. In future, we will take an intensive look at Category I and bring in modernisation. We will introduce innovation. If there is no discernible development in these areas, which are in Category VII rather than Category I, but still affect agriculture, if SAPARD is not implemented, we will ask you to take the innovative resources that made LEADER such a success and transpose them so as to provide rapid short-term help. We will bring this in, and we will also take care that all the security for farmers will not prevent the consumers, too, being certain that produce will be safe for them and not injurious to their health. At first reading, we will vote to add the necessary resources to the reserve, resources that formerly seemed to be needed in order to properly treat BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. We are aware that these diseases have recently appeared among sheep and elsewhere. I do not know whether appropriate steps will be taken on this front. We will act accordingly in the first instance, until the letter of amendment has been presented and we have an overall view of things. We will make it our concern to meet and overcome the two great challenges presented in Category II. The reconstruction of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets is crucial and of the utmost importance. People there have relied on being able to pursue their livelihood subject to certain restrictions. The failure of the Morocco Agreement means that will no longer be possible. I am now addressing both the Commission and the Council when I say that we found that provision of these EUR 125 million, even though it was clear at the beginning of this year that the money could not be used, hardly a serious way of doing things. Despite this – or indeed because of it – the fishermen have a claim on help from us, and we will ensure in the Budget process that appropriate action is taken. The same applies to the frontier regions, which are not always rich and able to help themselves. I think, for example, of Bavaria; regions like that are a bit better off. There are other regions which really need more aid, with which we will be concerned. What we will be developing in Category III will be oriented towards the future. Developments following 11 September have shown us that developments are needed in this area. Europol and Eurojust must be developed further, and national sensitivities must be overcome. If terrorism is to be combated, all its advantages in the game must be done away with. We must not stand on old rights. There is room for progress here. What we want is to continue with what was begun last year, that is to say, the inclusion of people in society by means of access to the labour market. We must not simply forget this a year on from it having been a crucial point in Mrs Haug's Budget report, now that new problems are in the offing. People also have a right to social inclusion through training in modern information and communications technologies. This applies not only to cultivated and highly educated people, but also to those who perform very simple work. Thank you very much for your attention. I again thank the rapporteurs and hope that, in cooperation with the other two institutions, we will be able to bring this process to a successful conclusion. (Applause)

Mr President, I will pass on your answer to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets. He had asked me to wait for it. On a personal note, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, above all, who has been here with us throughout the whole of the discussions on the Budget. Things like that do not happen all the time. So, without wishing to seem presumptuous, I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, not only for showing us so much respect, but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us. Many thanks! (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the cohesion policy is an integral component of the European Union. The European Union will not make progress in growing together if solidarity does not always play some part. We all know that those who are stronger and richer must help those who are poorer or not yet as strong or in the process of catching up. We are talking today about what was to be seen over the last few years and, of course, also about the conclusions we must draw from that for the years to come. Today, I want to take a look at the current state of our cohesion policy, in other words: how are we spending the money we have allocated to this truly vital EU policy? Right up to Agenda 2000, we used to have the stormiest debates about how much money was to be spent. If, though, we now look at how implementation is actually proceeding, we cannot but have grave doubts as to whether this is being taken seriously enough. The new aid period began last year, so, of course, things cannot move as fast at the outset as they can halfway down the track, but it must be pointed out all the same that implementation is proceeding at a wretched rate in the various fields. There is simply no other way of putting it. This has been a frequent topic in the Committee on Budgets, and even the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has taken it up and will continue to discuss it. Looking at current discussions in the context of the Budget consultations – and here I must address my remarks to the Council – we see that the Council has allocated only 1% for next year's new liabilities, and that is then supposed to be converted into payments. One per cent of all we are prepared to commit, that is supposed to be paid out! We are producing a backlog, of the sort that we often used to have. We are piling up funds rather than fast-tracking aid, and fast aid is good aid, because we want many countries and regions no longer to need aid when enlargement actually comes about. If we really want to help them out of their plight, if we really want to make room for the new countries who want to join us, we must give aid fast and in concentrated form, in other words: there must be appropriate follow-up here. I call upon the Commission – which has already submitted proposals on this – but also upon the Council, to follow up words with actions, for cohesion is only any good as and when it actually reaches people, and that needs to be as soon as possible!

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I must begin by informing Markus Ferber from Bavaria that he will not necessarily find commonalities on those points where he hoped to find them. Let me explain why. He said that we must first establish a different form of institutional development for the European Union before we talk about the EU’s finances. I think this is wrong. This is especially apparent from the issues before us today. If you ask any member of the public nowadays what the European Union spends its money on, 30% will say ‘to cover its administrative costs’, and another 30% will have no idea at all where the money goes. That means that 60% do not know what we do with the resources provided by the tax-payer. However, the tax-payers know that what they see as massive amounts of money are involved. Enormous sums of money are spent, and I think that today of all days, the general public would be astonished, yet again, by what is happening at European level. On the one hand, we have a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget. In one of them, the European Union, the Commission, shows that it has no intention of complying more than cursorily with the will of Parliament, at least as far as the sections on UCLAF or the new OLAF structure are concerned. We made a very clear statement on this issue during the year. We wanted to shape personnel and the staffing structure in such a way as to create a new institution which fulfils modern requirements. In fact, it is only thanks to our colleague Herbert Bösch, who was willing to grasp the nettle, that no attempt was made to redeploy the staff and reshape this same institution – which, of course, was the focus of intensive debate last time – into another, which cannot develop entirely new structures as its personnel remains the same. This also deserves criticism here. My second point is this. We will be returning EUR 11 billion to the Member States. EUR 11 billion means that we have a budget underspend of around 10%. We have an underspend in the field of consumer policy, where just 74.7% of funds are being used. Consumer policy – that is a word to savour! This is the issue we have spent more time and energy discussing over the last few months, if not years, than any other – and yet only 75% of its budget is actually being spent. We have allocated funds to address one of the European Union’s major problems, namely under-employment. Let me give you the rate of expenditure in the field of employment policy: 39.6%. We have millions of unemployed, money has been made available, and yet less than 40% of these funds is being spent. Explain that to the European public! We are handing back billions! In category IV, i.e. external actions, we see that just under 60% of the funds allocated to the European initiative for democracy and the protection of human rights – an issue which we spend hours discussing for every resolution, as well as under "urgent business" – is being spent. The rest is forfeited and goes back to the Member States. Let me make it very clear: the European public must be told where the money goes. However, they should also be told where it comes from. That is being discussed quite specifically today, for it is always implied that the Member States provide the money. That is the case here today as well. We must ensure that the public understands the situation. We must make the revenue side and the expenditure side more transparent. We cannot continue to explain why we battle against the Council in the budget debates to secure an extra 11 billion, only to hand it back in the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget at the beginning of the following year because it has not been used. The money then goes back into the relevant national budgets. We must move away from this situation. There must be a reliable and accountable source of revenue which is transparent to the public. Whatever form this takes, we must not cobble together a solution – Markus Ferber is quite right on that point. We must not be tempted, as a knee-jerk reaction, to agree any old solution as quickly as possible, for an uncoordinated, unstructured debate only leads to confusion. We must be able to manage this. Once we have set this up on the revenue side, once it is directly linked to citizens, and the expenditure side is then controlled by citizens as well – for they will look very carefully at what we are doing with the money – no further funds will be returned to the Member States. Instead, they will ask us: how have you actually managed the money? This is where we draw together the two issues which we are discussing today – the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget, with massive movements of money on the one hand and own resources on the other. In other words, the issue is this: how much is the public actually paying for Europe? In my view, there is no need to be frightened about telling the public what we are doing. We have good arguments, we have very good policy areas and policies, and we can present them persuasively. There is no need to be frightened of the public: we simply need to approach them very openly and transparently, and invite them to work with us on building Europe here.

Mr President, I am truly amazed – I freely admit – by the last speaker as the official spokesman of the PPE group. I really expected nothing of the sort. I would have expected him to be closer to us, now that we know that the Greens have tabled a proposed amendment rejecting this supplementary and amending budget. But nothing should come as a surprise in the European Parliament, especially not in this area. The common foreign and security policy is one of the policies of the European Union which, to all intents and purposes, has yet to be developed. In the past, it is true, we had a situation in which several Commissioners had to agree between themselves as to who was to look after and deal with which part of the world. At times we remember this and smile. But, when you look at politics from the point of view of content, it is irresponsible of the European Union not to speak with one voice and to behave like a dwarf in the world when it is in fact an economic global player and – to put it nastily – could in theory push the Secretary-General and representative of the common foreign and security policy around like an operetta general. That is why we are convinced that anyone who wants to take the common foreign and security policy seriously and really implement it, anyone who wants to prevent the lack of European policy in the foreign policy area that we have seen over recent years, must support the common foreign and security policy. This morning, Mr Brok said in the debate on the transatlantic dialogue that we, as the European Union, had no profile in Ukraine and that blunders had been made, which is why we must take the Council's desire to make real progress here seriously and support it. So support in principle is there. When the supplementary and amending budget was presented to us – and here I concur fully with Mr Ferber – not only did it fail to convince us; on the contrary we got all worked up and opposed to it. It is wrong to try and hide such an important area which is so crucial to the future of the European Union beneath a gentlemen's agreement between Parliament and the Council in a budget over which only the Council has any influence. All that does is to demonstrate that you do not want any parliamentary control or any parliamentary support. Which is unacceptable. We said as much from the outset and we shall continue to take this view and to formulate our policy and vote accordingly. But if you enter into negotiations and can clear up this point, i.e. if you can demonstrate that the supplementary and amending budget has been changed so that we can assume in future that we have are involved and have a say, when there is a separate chapter under which the Council shapes future policy in the common foreign and security policy area with parliamentary support and control, then you have to agree to it if you really want to make progress. That is not the time to stand on the sidelines and say, we are waiting to see what happens next. In all events, one thing is clear: when in reply to questions from the relevant Commissioner one is told in the Committee on Foreign Affairs or in the Committee on Budgets, with the wink of an eye, according to my sources, that there is no overlap, then it is hardly surprising that people ask questions and want to know exactly how things stand. What we shall not support – and I say this now as a member of the budgetary authority, we are talking here first and foremost as the budgetary authority – are overlapping structures. We cannot stand and watch two different people doing the same work under the same structures for the same tasks in the European Union. That cannot be. In this respect, we have to know what the common foreign and security policy should look like in the future and who is to be responsible for it. We need concepts here and the Council and Commission need to know where they stand here. We shall, of course, bring our standpoint very clearly to bear in the overall debate. We shall wield our power as budgetary authority on every future demand in order to stop this sort of blunder. Now is not the time to be petty. Europe's share of the common foreign and security policy is still very small. We should not start by being petty. But we shall monitor how everything develops very closely, we shall address painful subjects and say stop as soon as we get the feeling that we are being taken for a ride. That cannot be. We shall agree here, but everyone should know that we shall be extremely vigilant in connection both with heading 5 and with how expenditure develops and with future developments in the common foreign and security policy. Of course, we shall also give our input so that a forward-looking policy for the world and for Europe as a whole can be developed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your comment, Mr Schmid, you saved me from having to say the same thing. Of course, it is tempting, when Markus Ferber makes such an offer, to take him up on it. Although seeing him with his trousers down is not a particularly appealing prospect, the idea of debating the issue he has raised here is not at all bad. Because a proposal such as the one he has just made, that is to give the financial perspective a thorough overhaul, is certainly something that needs to be taken very seriously and is a very good starting point. However, we have to recognise that we are, of course, dealing with taxpayers' money. We are dealing with tax revenue. It is all very easy to stand there and say: "The framework you have established is pure nonsense, we can just sweep it aside, because we need more." It is all very easy to say that with hindsight. Of course, the world has changed over the last few weeks and months, and I will make no secret of the fact that over the last few years I have repeatedly asked whether the financial resources for one thing or another really are adequate in view of the acute problems we are faced with. These acute problems are some of the issues the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to address during the budget debates. Consumer confidence and food quality are, of course, also acute problems. These are two of the really major priorities that in recent weeks and months have really run into difficulties because of unforeseeable events in the fields of agricultural policy and public food supply. But we cannot just stand there now and act as if nothing had happened, we cannot just bury our heads in the sand and say that everything must carry on as before and that what was agreed in the past will remain correct for ever. At this point we really must make the question of consumer protection and food quality, in the context of a reform of agricultural policy, one of our top priorities. Now let me mention another top priority and urgent issue. In this case I must insist that we cannot simply forget and sweep aside something that we have fought hard for for two years, by which I mean the issue of peace in Europe and, in particular, peace in the Balkans. This is not a subject that can just be brushed aside because a new and more serious problem has arisen, and perhaps one that affects us more directly. Rebuilding the Balkans and providing peacekeeping forces, providing support for the people there, are also issues that impact on the future viability of Europe as a whole. Everything that we fail to do now to create peaceful structures there may rebound on us at some time in the future. Which of you would like to guarantee that we will not be drawn into military conflicts again in the future if we give people the impression that we are more likely to support them when they are fighting each other? It must be obvious at the moment that the best thing is for them to work together with us to maintain peace in Europe. Another acute need that is also the result of events in recent years, but is at the same time also a pointer for the future, is the fight against unemployment. This is an area in which we have, in the past, been successful in Europe, in the European Union. Last year, the unemployment rate fell from 8.7% to 8%. The European Union itself has, of course, not borne the greatest part of this burden, but we can certainly claim to have played an integral part in making progress by virtue of our proposals and initiatives. If social inclusion is taken seriously and we refuse to accept that sections of the population are excluded from participating in the labour market, for example, then we have to take appropriate countermeasures here. People have a right to expect us to fight hard against unemployment. But social inclusion – as Neena Gill has already said – also means that with the advent of new technology everyone must have an opportunity to participate in this society. Such participation cannot depend on whether people have enough money to buy a top-of-the-range computer and use it for their children's education. We must make absolutely sure to involve everyone. One point that is certainly much more important in political terms than in budgetary terms is, as Markus Ferber has quite rightly said, the issue of immigration flows. I am pleased that we in the Committee on Budgets agreed that we would deal with this subject under the headings of "migration" and "provision of aid". How can we deal with immigration that is either unwanted or which we may find desirable at some point in the future? I am not talking about criminalising it or reacting to it emotionally, but we must tackle this subject. I regard it as being very positive that we can reconcile this with the wording of the corresponding part of Mr Costa Neves' draft report. My next point is the common foreign and security policy. This is another point that may not have a particular impact in budgetary terms at the moment, but which is certainly important politically speaking. We should no longer be worrying about how we in Europe can enhance the networking of military structures or how we can get more military units on the ground – European security policy should also be about disarmament, that is to say about dismantling the weapons of mass destruction that threaten us. This should not just be a one-sided matter; it must also be in our interest to contribute to a global process of dismantling weapons of mass destruction. That should be an important priority for us. In conclusion I would like to say that we intend to accept the draft report prepared by Mr Costa Neves, which we consider to be very good. There is room for improvement in some places, and we have tabled appropriate amendments, and I know that there is a lot of support for these, for which I am deeply grateful. We will always consider the budget – not only this year, but every year – from this point of view: do we as a Parliament actually have a voice in the budget as a whole or do we only have a right of say on one part of it? As we see it, there can only be one overall budget, without distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, and it needs to cover revenue and expenditure alike. Only then will the budget procedure be complete, and that is our long-term goal. (Applause)

 Madam President, we have made a further improvement to one part of the amendment, in agreement with the rapporteur. It reads as follows: "Hopes that true to the rules of social dialogue the Commission will continue to consult with the parties concerned." The change is in the word "continue". This is the only change, and as I said it has been agreed with the rapporteur and so he accepts it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have the first supplementary budget of the year, somewhat earlier than last year. Last year, we had a rather more pleasant duty to perform on behalf of the Member States. We were able to reimburse the sum of 3.2 billion to them. This year, in an area which plays an enormously influential role in European policy, we are forced to implement a measure which no one can possibly relish. Not only because of its underlying theme, but also because there is no alternative to the Commission's proposed approach. This is not just annoying but it enrages me to see that in order to rectify a situation, we have to support a process which is almost impossible to justify to anyone with any common sense. I do not want to say yet again that it is incredible that foodstuffs which were produced with massive amounts of money now simply have to be incinerated. We are not only dealing with a financial crisis. Of course I am speaking as a budget specialist here, but I cannot focus solely on the financial aspects, for we face a crisis of confidence as well. The people watching us cannot understand that we are just accepting this without demanding real follow-up measures. And as much as I value Mr Böge's calm approach – and he is certainly a good example of how we should be responding in this situation – no normal sentient and thinking person could possibly stay genuinely calm and simply say yes to what is being demanded of us. We are required to decide on a measure which stretches our credulity to the limit. So I have every sympathy with those who say, “Let's reject it.” Or those who say, “Let's put the thumbscrews on the agriculture ministers.” I sympathise with all of them, because what is happening here is almost beyond belief. In reality, however, what we must do is to bring about a change of course. But this cannot be achieved overnight. We cannot completely reshape our agricultural policy in the first two months of this year and make it the basis of our decision here today. That is simply not feasible. We cannot halt meat production overnight, because the calves are already gestating. And to pretend that all we need to do is press a switch to make everything better is simply an illusion. We have to be honest enough to admit this. But we must also make it very clear that if we support this measure here today, we are not giving the Commission or the Council a free rein. In the coming weeks and months we will be looking very closely at the proposals you submit to us. We will not be saying, “Carry on as usual.” Let me make this very clear. We must not take desperate measures in the heat of the moment, but there will be no 'business as usual' either. Instead, you will have to put forward proposals to ensure sustainable development and discuss them with us in detail. You must also understand that as far as the budget is concerned, the end – and the upper limit – have been reached with this decision today. There is no more after this. Everything that happens in future will have a dramatic impact, not only for us but also for you, when you have to prepare items or agree measures in the Council. You can assume that you have our agreement once again this time, but it will be far more difficult in future, unless very good grounds and substantive policy amendments are put forward in this context.

 Mr President, my thanks first and foremost to Florence Parly, who is just leaving but who, I think, is still within earshot. After the experiences of last year, I think she has created a very good atmosphere, both here and in the Council, with the active commitment which she has shown throughout her presidency. I should also like to thank Mrs Schreyer, who has continued to help us with her highly constructive approach and, of course, my friend Jutta Haug, who has done an excellent job, not forgetting Joan Colom i Naval and Markus Ferber. We are now at the point at which we must decide whether or not we can vote in favour of this budget next Thursday. Obviously we need to take a very close look at it and this is exactly what Parliament in general and we Social Democrats in particular intend to do. We believe that we managed to do a great deal of good during the discussions, both retaining and extending crucial priorities. With unemployment still at over 8% throughout Europe, the European Union needs to use the budget at its disposal to send out a clear message and to set about fighting this scourge in the economy to our citizens, which is why it is important that we have this 450 million at our disposal next year, starting with 100 million this year. It shows people that we take their problems seriously and are doing something about them. I am delighted that we have managed in Category IV of this budget to show those living in the greatest need or in the process of democratising their countries throughout the world that this European Parliament and this European Union has not forgotten them, even if we have our own problems to resolve, and that here too we are making sure that there is enough money to go round. It is important for the people in the Balkans to understand, following the long period of hostilities during which our side presented a united front, that they can also rely on us when it comes to reconstruction. There are people sitting in this House who are at pains to ensure that the money needed will in fact be provided as and when it is needed and that flowery words will be accompanied by specific actions. So I think that, along with much else which there is too little time to mention, we have a great deal to be pleased about. We have also passed a number of resolutions containing instructions. Allow me to say to the Commission, by way of example, that we have agreed to the 400 additional posts because we want to improve how various programmes are implemented, because we want you to be able to work better than you have been able to do in the past. But we also say in no uncertain terms that this implies a responsibility and a commitment on your part, because we shall be watching over you throughout this process. We shall be checking up, we shall be in contact with you and we shall be keeping tabs on what is happening, ensuring that there really has been an improvement before we are prepared to go even further with you. It is also a commitment vis-à-vis the Council. I have a couple of questions to put to the Council – not that I am questioning the compromise. But should we really have to try year after year to see what is left over from the previous year, what can be carried over to provide enough money for regions such as Serbia and the Balkans? Should we really have to check first and see what is left over? Is our message to these people: we will give you what is left over and then we shall see if we can add anything to it? Should that be our message? No it should not! By refusing to discuss the specific long-term aspects of this challenge with us, you have brought the whole spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement into question. You keep saying that the financial perspective is sacrosanct as far as you are concerned. But the Interinstitutional Agreement between the three institutions is also a valuable item and should help us to achieve joint planning security. The Balkans and other regions need planning security. Repeated use of the flexibility instrument also contradicts the Interinstitutional Agreement, because it was an instrument which this European Parliament secured in order to pay for contingencies and so that it could let it run up to EUR 600 million. It was never meant to be used for firefighting every year in areas which we have to fund in any case. You are undermining the Interinstitutional Agreement and let me assure you that we shall consider whether or not we intend to have a part in this next year.
Walter (PSE

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all I would like to extend warm thanks to the four rapporteurs who have done the groundwork for today. They have really excelled themselves and I feel this merits the recognition of the House. We are delighted to have found a basis for negotiations and a mood for negotiation, particularly as regards the Council, given that last year, we had a rather strained atmosphere to contend with, and this produced tension. The present mood allows for objective and focussed work, because instead of drawing up battlelines, we endeavour to actually solve the problems facing us. However, of course this also means coming clean with the tax payer and those who listen to us, on a whole range of points, so as to give them a realistic picture of the conditions we work under. Parliament has demonstrated repeatedly over the past few years that extreme financial prudence is the bedrock of our work. It is pure fiction to maintain that all we have ever been interested in is spending as much money as possible. That is not our approach! Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you only have to consider the fact that over the past five years, we have kept within the ceilings by EUR 15 billion, to realise that Parliament is at pains to deploy its funds as efficiently as possible. What we are not prepared to do though, is to simply dismiss out of hand, things we believe to be necessary, and which have been recognised as necessities following negotiations with yourself and the Commission, when there are new items on the agenda. We cannot have a situation where people who place their trust in us are let down in favour of the next ones in the queue. And so we must think about how to solve this problem. In the past – and we attach a great deal of importance to this – we have always kept to our mutual decisions under the Interinstitutional Agreement and the financial perspective. If the rates of increase seem to be high this year, then this is due primarily to the fact that the sharpest rates of increase are to be found in the sphere where we have the least say, i.e. agriculture. It is not that I want to complain about this. There has been a corresponding change in policy, and this must be financed accordingly – that is not what I am complaining about – but nor do I expect the President-in-Office to then stand up in this Chamber and say that there has been a huge increase, and comment that the Member States are financially prudent, whilst Parliament wants to push expenditure to the limit. That is not true, because you are the one primarily responsible for determining compulsory expenditure, and that is precisely where the figures are so high! When you look at the figures – a 6.3% increase in compulsory expenditure and, by your own admission, a 0.23% increase in our areas – then you will see who is really being financially prudent, so as to be able to pursue their policies, and who is responsible for the increases. With all due respect for the fact that the national Finance Ministers have set out to reduce their national debts and actually cancel commitments entered into in the past, so as to safeguard opportunities for future generations, I would point out that Parliament has commitments from the past too! We are not in a position to accumulate debt. Perhaps that is just as well. But we have made promises in the past, or rather made announcements and formulated common policies that will in fact need to be converted into payments at some stage. We cannot have a situation where we talk in a very relaxed manner about commitments over the years, and repeatedly make these promises, but then, when it comes to paying up, say that we are now unable to afford it and will have to cut back a bit in this area! I believe it is very important for the Council members to register the fact that payments are commitments entered into in the past that will actually have to be honoured. We can approach this in two ways with these payments. Mr Elles made the point that we could of course reduce the commitments and retain the payments, which would enable us to honour the commitments at some stage. But that would mean having to scrutinise our policies and cut back on them. I make no bones about the fact that the policies we agreed on formed the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the financial perspective. They are important to us. These things mattered in the past, but they still matter today – now that we have a different political climate within Europe – particularly as there is so much at stake. We want to tackle unemployment for example. One outstanding achievement to come out of this budget is that we are prepared to join forces to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which create the most jobs, thereby benefiting Europe’s economy. We want to do something for them, and provision has been made for this in the budget in terms of actual figures. We want to do something to combat social exclusion, and to help the weakest of the weak. One of the policies we have opted for in the agricultural sector is to move away from a system of direct subsidies towards enhanced support for rural areas. This is a key priority in Parliament’s book, particularly as we have a right to a say in such matters. We intend to make sure that this area, more than any other, is given a boost. We have made it our business, over the past year, to see that all the funds allocated for this sphere were indeed taken up, because it is vital to frame the necessary policies for rural areas and for the people who live there. We are more than happy to work with the Council and all the others, on this. I say this as a Social Democrat. It is traditionally said of the Social Democrats that as a party, they are not the natural representatives of farmers or rural areas. I will tell you now that we most certainly are, because we believe in equal opportunities. We have other priorities on the foreign policy front. We want to combat poverty, wherever it happens to be in the world. We want to drive democratisation processes forward, and we want to strike a balance between the traditional political fields of foreign policy now before us. We believe that a constructive approach to eastward enlargement should go hand in hand with a well thought out and properly financed Mediterranean policy. These two policy areas must be in harmony with each other. Anyone who pursues eastward enlargement, must also be aware that as far as we are concerned, the Mediterranean is also an important part of the geopolitical situation we have to engage ourselves in. Something else we have had to deal with latterly, and which has caused us a great deal of problems – thankfully I would say, because they stem from the fact that a democratisation process is underway – is the situation in the Balkans. When you, Mr President-in-Office, then say this must be financed from existing budgetary funds, I would ask you to consider just one thing: this year alone we have made 200 000 flexibility instruments available, and supplemented this with EUR 180 million from the emergency reserve. Therefore, this year alone we will have included EUR 380 million in fresh funds in the budgetary lines and made it available. This problem will occupy us for the next six or seven years, and probably even longer. When we see that we have already committed EUR 380 million in fresh funds to this area this year, then I am completely baffled as to how, if we estimate that we are going to need EUR 5.5 billion for Serbia over the next seven years, for example, we are going to be able simply to produce it out of thin air. This would be impossible! We are prepared to take a look at our budget and see where we could improve our effectiveness. This would go hand in hand with the reform of the Commission, which, as it happens, has already set us thinking about how we can make our policies more effective overall. One strategy is to create reserves, and then we must enquire closely, before we make the money available, as to how matters are to be taken forward. A second strategy is the one used by the Commission, i.e. the reform process within the Commission is being reinforced by making the appropriate number of staff available, so that the steady stream of additional tasks we have taken upon ourselves in the past, can actually be implemented. The worst thing that can befall us is to arouse hopes and then have to disappoint them. With your permission, I will again make the point, in the light of a current discussion, that over the past few years, and again this year, Parliament has discussed whether, people who are affected by natural disasters can receive aid from Parliament’s budget. Let there be no mistake, I think it is criminal to give people who have been affected by natural disasters the impression that we have the means to solve all the problems they face as a result. If we only include a few million in the lines – that is about all we can manage – it is just a stalling tactic, because when the people actually come to need it, we withdraw it again. When there have been one or two disasters at the beginning of the year, all we need to tell people at the end of the year is that we are sorry but we do not have anything left for them. There are people in northern Italy who need our help at the moment, but if they were to turn to Europe, we would have to tell them we were sorry but we do not have any money left because we spent it back in January, February or March. That is completely irresponsible. That is not the kind of perception we want people to have of Europe. When we announce something, or promise something, when we say we are able, and want, to help, then we must be in a position to follow this up. We must organise our political structures accordingly. We must go through what we define as being the central aspects of our policies with a fine toothcomb, and we must work together to see that our proposals are properly financed. As Socialists, we expressly offer our cooperation. I am looking forward to the forthcoming discussions with the Commission and the Council, and hope, in the interests of the citizens of Europe, that we reach some positive conclusions.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing much to add in principle to what has already been said. We too shall, of course, be voting in favour of the two reports. What I have to say refers to supplementary and amending budget 1 which, as Mr Ferber has just said, brings Christmas in July for the Council. The Council has the enviable task of being able to claw back and budget EUR 3.2 billion. If only we could attract the same intensive and intense attention and discussion when we discuss the fact that we are looking for 200 million in order to balance the budget next year and finance a task which has a huge effect on Europe, i.e. Kosovo or the Balkans as a whole. The figure under discussion at present is 3.2 billion, i.e. sixteen times that amount, and it will rightly be refunded, on that I have no doubt. The figure of 200 million will then probably be discussed elsewhere. We had this problem last year and we shall no doubt face a similar problem again this year. In terms of order of size, it may perhaps be a little more, but the principle is the same and it is a problem we have to solve. My request to the Council is: bear this in mind, including for the forthcoming negotiations. It would be wonderful of course if we did not have to give back all the money which we are now refunding, if there were an agreement between the Council and Parliament whereby we could retain some of the money for contingencies. That would, of course, enable us to change the whole modus operandi between us in the future. I admit it is a highly unusual proposal, but we should consider the possibility of a reserve for contingencies. I think that would help to defuse individual budget debates. I should like to address another two parts of the supplementary budget. The first is that, thanks to the excellent proposal by our rapporteur Mr Bourlanges, we have indeed managed to provide 20 million for Montenegro, where we have agreed to urgent procedure. However, we must find this 20 million by squeezing the margin dry. We cannot use the 3.2 billion; instead we must squeeze the margin dry. We do not need to be told, as the English say, to put our money where our mouth is, i.e. where it is needed; on the contrary, we are giving the money back and then looking around for spare change in order to perform our duties. I should like to ask the Council to be a little more circumspect in its announcements and promises in the future unless, at the same time, it intends to tell us what we should cross out elsewhere. I can only ask the Council in the present procedure – relating to supplementary budget 1 – not to cause any more problems by withholding its approval. It really would be most welcome for the forthcoming budgetary procedure if the Council could be accommodating here and vote with us. That would be a good sign and could shape the forthcoming budget debates. My request to the Council is: please proceed as I suggest; we shall be more than happy to acknowledge such a procedure.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressly welcoming Mr Ferber’s report in its broadest outlines. We have enjoyed extremely positive collaboration over recent weeks and months, cooperation marked by the fact that we expressed our opinions in no uncertain terms on the points where we diverged widely, but when you can reach a common line, then that is the path you should take. The challenge which faces us has been described. One can in fact do no more than repeat it. In the wake of Amsterdam – and I say this now in anticipation of what is yet to come in relation to this Parliament – we must reconcile the powers which Parliament now has with its potential, because at present they do not stand in a very balanced ratio. We must ensure that we can achieve equality in arms with the other legislative authority, namely the Council, both in respect of the scientific service and scientific research. We cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directly-elected Parliament to lag behind what the Council can do. If we take our work seriously, if we take ourselves seriously, we must operate under the same conditions so that we really can stand up for ourselves. There is no point in the President of our Parliament just putting her mark at the bottom of the page. That is not enough; it is the work beforehand which is crucial and it needs to be carried out seriously and it needs to be carried out well. In this respect it is both right and important – and I expressly disagree with Mr Dell'Alba here – that we prepare ourselves properly. Nor can there be any question of exorbitant cost increases now. Mr Dell'Alba knows full well that, thanks to a clever buildings policy – let there be no mistake about that – we have been able to release considerable funds over recent years. Having scrimped and saved this money ourselves, we then need to use it to good purpose. To good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this Parliament. We are still within the 20% margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it. At no point do we go over Parliament’s 20% share of administrative costs. I think that shows that our approach is very serious here and we do not want to promise any cloud cuckoo land. Another challenge before us – admittedly we have been pushed into action here by official discussions in various quarters – is the need to bring some transparency into this Parliament. We shall accept this responsibility and take up this challenge. Not because we are afraid of being forced to do so. No, we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here. We are endeavouring to create a serious basis for what we do here, i.e. financing for the groups, and we want a set of rules so that the European political parties and party organisations can raise funds. You cannot call for this sort of development at European level without financing the basis commensurately, that is quite right. The basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where. We shall do everything we can to make progress on this point and to bring more transparency into the process, so that everyone can see what money is going where and can judge if it is appropriate or unsuitable and criticism can then be levied where criticism is needed. And it is needed. However, we must head off criticism on procedural grounds or because we have accommodated certain sums under various budget headings. Transparency is needed here and, as we said last year during the budget debates, we have our work cut out here. Allow me to comment now on the question of enlargement, because that is the only point on which we disagree with Mr Ferber and, above all, with our colleagues in the PPE group. What worries me here is that Mr Stoiber’s visit to your group last week had a greater impact than we all feared. My next comment is addressed to my honourable friend, Mr Pöttering: it was you who said at a European Union conference “onwards and upwards”, and that enlargement should be speeded up for political reasons, because we cannot afford to put it on the back burner. But, when we are specifically called upon to move forwards, we should do so decisively. I know that the issue of when and how enlargement should take place can be the stuff of first-rate political debate, a debate which could set the axe at the very roots and I call for extreme caution here. As far as specific preparations are concerned, we need, for example, to make preparations for more buildings. And if you do not start looking for buildings, for example in the candidate countries, until things are so far down the road, you will be faced with prices which make your hair turn grey. So we need to get our act together and make preparations which allow for sound financial management. As far as preparing for new languages is concerned, if you read the Cot report, called for by the honourable Member of your group, Mr Elles, you will see that we shall have an additional 460 language combinations in the future. According to one estimate, this will mean another 500 translators and interpreters. Do you expect us to believe that you are suddenly going to jump up like a jack in the box with a list of people who are highly specialised in Estonian, Latvian, Czech, in all these new languages which we shall have? No, preparations need to be made now. And in order to avoid falling into the trap, as Mr Ferber rightly explained, of taking administrative decisions which anticipate political developments, we must, of course, ensure during the course of the year that we have a precise discussion on the distribution of these posts between the various languages. We shall support the release of the Cot report – that is one part of Mr Elles’ motion. We are in favour of discussing this during the course of the year, but we are expressly against saying as of now that we refuse to fill the 35 posts. That would be frivolous and would send completely the wrong signal to the Member States and to the people who hope to become an integral part of the Union.

Mr President, Commissioner, first may I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr Ferber and Mrs Haug on the work which they have carried out. In the first year in which the full budgetary procedure comes to fruition, we are all bound to be highly enthusiastic. Everyone wants to have their say, as we have seen in the very active and lively debates over recent days and weeks. The Union budget of EUR 90 billion represents so many hopes, the hopes of people looking for support. They may be farmers in the European Union, who obviously want appropriate remuneration, a just reward, which they have earned, for producing healthy food. They may be the regions in Europe which are lagging behind in terms of economic development and which expect much from the solidarity of the European Union, namely assistance to help them develop into a balanced system of cohesion within the European Union, as far as living and working conditions are concerned. There are the hopes of the unemployed, who want us to support them along the path back to work. There are the hopes of the young, there are hopes throughout the world, in which we, as the rich continent of Europe, and we are the rich continent of Europe, can give assistance. And there are hopes at the heart of Europe, where we have a cancerous growth called war, where there are people who are forced to live in appalling conditions, people who need a future, people who need hope. We do not want any curious divisions of tasks, as are presently becoming apparent, when this money is distributed over the coming weeks and months. It is becoming apparent that there are people on the one side who are making promises left, right and centre and raising their estimates. Contrary to what has been said here time and again, agricultural spending will not fall, it will rise by nearly 5% or even more than 5% next year. We must not upset the farmers too much in this European Union. We cannot have a situation in which people on the one side, i.e. the Council, promise money and increase the sums involved and then come to us in Parliament and say, be sure to keep overall expenditure down, make cuts in all areas and tell all other ‘hopefuls’ that there is nothing for them. This division of tasks is unacceptable. Nor can we have a situation in which the international community sits down at the donor conference, promises money and says to Kosovo and everyone living in the Balkans, we will support you, you will get money for what you want. In future, excavators will be rattling past, not tanks. You must be able to reconstruct and we want to help you. We cannot have a situation in which they promise so much and then come and say, take the money we need from the most needy. That cannot be. We have stretched out our hand. Mrs Haug has stretched out her hand. She has said that we are prepared to work openly with the Council and the Commission. We want to show you that there is no need for a repeat of last year’s tragedy, with heckling and confrontation throughout the entire budgetary procedure. We can work together. You should know that. Take the outstretched hand. But I say quite clearly at this point that, if you signal that you are not prepared to cooperate with us and that we are on course for a confrontation, then this Parliament is not defenceless or powerless and we shall use our powers for the people who place their hopes in us and we shall certainly not disappoint them. Take the outstretched hand and do not engage in the same pettiness as last year, because it damages all of us in Europe, including the people who pin their hopes on us.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Budget 2000 is the budget which will take us into the next millennium. It represents a gesture. It represents a gesture in terms of political content; but it must also be a gesture of how we should actually have to deal with each other. I would like to start by saying that we as a Parliament must thank our two rapporteurs in this respect, with respect to the debate of the Budget 2000, for carrying out excellent work, for getting things under way which have been discussed at length in this House. I remember the new regulation in connection with the Technical Assistance Offices which Commissioner Schreyer referred to this morning. We had a meeting of the Committee on Budgets last week at which very clear commitments were entered into as far as the future is concerned, so that we can expect to make progress here and exercise control. We shall support you in a constructively critical manner on this question of the future development of the Technical Assistance Offices. As far as past experience is concerned, namely the proper deployment of appropriations, we have made a gesture by increasing OLAF staff numbers. We have made quite unequivocal gestures as far as one of the largest items of budgetary expenditure is concerned, namely agricultural policy. We want to break away from mere market price support and move towards rural development and additional appropriations will be provided in forthcoming budgets in order to do so. We have made it clear that only consumers are important in our Europe, which is why we have strengthened the Food Safety Agency, in order to make a gesture at this point, and we have entered relevant appropriations to make up for social weaknesses in the budget, so that progress can be made in combating unemployment. These are things which have been discussed in this Parliament with great unanimity and on which progress has been made on the initiative and with the support of our rapporteurs. The decisive point in this discussion or rather the point which caused us the most work and the most worry was of course the question of how to finance properly one of the greatest challenges facing Europe in the coming years? I refer of course to the Balkans and, more specifically, to Kosovo which will be targeted as a priority next year. You can rest assured that we in this House will do everything to lay solid foundations. We made this very clear during the budgetary procedure. We are interested in having sound foundations so that we do not just lurch from one problem to the next, but so that we can work together on a solid basis for years to come, because the problem in the Balkans is not a problem which can be solved in a year. We have shown very clearly that we do not just want to demand more here; we also want to do our homework. We have made transfers in the budget, very specific transfers. We have not made any general reduction; instead we have said we will make reductions as and where possible. We have expressly made an exception for non-governmental organisations or aid programmes, such as those to combat AIDS in third world countries, which need all the support they can get. We have done all this with a great deal of unanimity. This also demonstrates how important these matters are to us. You have seen for yourself that there is a great deal of unanimity in every debate and in every vote in this House. Completely irrespective of our ideological backgrounds, we have conducted ourselves in a manner which must have made it clear to you that we take the matter and the manner of our dealings with each other very seriously indeed. And this will be our motto for the coming years. I must support Mr Böge all the way on this. We shall also endeavour in the future to create a basis of trust in our dealings with each other, a trust which was perhaps lacking at several junctures this year, both on our part towards you and on your part towards us. So we are holding out our hand, as Social Democrats and Socialists, as a sign that, if tomorrow morning you in fact table the declaration as described, we shall support it. And we shall ensure that there is a proper budget for the year which also offers a perspective. But we shall also work consistently towards ensuring in the coming years that again we do not lurch from one problem to another but that we have a serious plan on which everyone can build, especially those who really need the money. In other words those now living inside the European Union and those living outside the Union who have a right to our solidarity. We shall continue to do our homework in the future. We shall take our potential as a Parliament very seriously, on that you can depend. But we shall also make an effort to work more closely with you, so that we do not need, as in this year, to find a solution so close to the end of the year. When you have trialogues and conciliation, you should use them for their intended purpose so that compromises can be found before the eleventh hour. We call on you to move towards us and we will move towards you. But, as we have said, you can be sure that we also know what we can do if we are trifled with!

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would expressly like to thank Mrs Dührkop Dührkop for the excellent work she is doing in the way of follow-up to Budget 2000. I believe it has rarely been the case that a rapporteur has had to contend with in excess of 60 carry-overs and five supplementary and amending budgets in the course of one financial year. A multitude of amendments and additions to the original budget plan prompted her to say, in the course of the last discussion we had on supplementary and amending budget 4 that she no longer recognises her own baby, that is to say Budget 1999. If what I am about to say has a ring of criticism about it, then it is not directed primarily at you Mrs Schreyer, for you are not the one who has had to take responsibility for this over the past few weeks, but when we as a Parliament draw up a budget at the end of a year, i.e. in the autumn, then we take for granted the fact that we are setting priorities in this budget and that these priorities are also the ones that will actually be applied in the course of the budgetary procedure and will be put into practice. Put another way, we assume that the things we consider to be important will actually be implemented in the form of policies. What we are in fact seeing is this budget being amended rather drastically for the fifth time. I am aware that we requested that the budget be amended a fifth time, directly on account of OLAF, and we stand by this, but all the same we must ask ourselves whether there is any point in setting priorities in the course of budgetary negotiations if they are only going to be revoked at a later date. Here is an example from last year: ultimately, the Committee on Budgets and also Parliament pushed very hard for a line covering aid for Armenia and Georgia to be increased. We were aware that not everyone was in agreement with this but pushed it through nonetheless. What we have found to be the case is that in the course of this year the additional three million that we earmarked were not used at all, rather they were completely dispensed with because the measures could not be implemented or because the decision was taken not to implement them. That is our problem. In future, we would like to know – and this is why we intend to monitor implementation more closely than before – what becomes of our priorities? We intend to ask you repeatedly in the course of the year what has actually happened in certain cases. This is also a task that we will entrust to our committees when we say to them: when you outline policies and literally follow our every move in the course of the budgetary procedure and say we need another EUR 100,000 there, for example, then would you please continue to follow matters up when it comes to implementation. I am also directing this comment at our own committees. It is not enough just to make one’s presence felt here in the budgetary procedure. What we have done in the course of the last few years is to incorporate an ever increasing amount of reserves into the budget in order to be able to improve control and become more heavily involved in implementation. But that truly cannot be the right way of going about things! Allow me also to direct a comment at the Commission on the subject of SAB5: you are of course aware that we were a new Parliament, – and I really must make our disapproval very plain at this juncture, as we approach the end of the year – yet still you introduced a supplementary budget in the summer recess, when we were completely unable to react to it because the new Parliament was not up and running at that stage. That is no way to behave! It is our intention – and you can rely on this being the case – to keep a very close eye indeed on this in future, that is to say on how you behave towards us and what prospect there is of us actually living up to our responsibilities. There is one more thing I would like to say as what I have said so far relates to the current budgetary procedure. We are now embarking on very difficult negotiations and there are figures in the frame again which none of us are very confident will actually form a sound basis. We concluded an interinstitutional agreement at the beginning of this year which was to strengthen people’s faith in cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. If this faith is to be justified, then what we produce in consequence of our decisions and in our discussions must have a firm basis. I want to make that very plain and make specific reference to the figures that have been placed before us for Kosovo. We must have very reliable figures for this, otherwise we will be constructing a budget that will grind to a halt in the course of next year. This would mean us having to reallocate and redistribute from left to right again something in the order of hundreds of millions, and a budgetary procedure cannot be used to this end! We want there to be a firm basis now; we want it to be made plain that the situation in Kosovo has gone on for several years now and that we must work together on this for several years to come. We want there to be a firm basis that is long-lasting. For we are not justified in undertaking an infinite number of reallocations and carry-overs and supplementary budgets when this gives the impression that we did not make a good enough job of our work to begin with. (Applause)

 Madam President, may I ask how it is that there is a change to the voting order? We have Amendment No 430 on the European Year of Languages as the next amendment to be voted on. Could someone, either Mr Bourlanges or yourself, give us some information on this?

 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, firstly, Mr Böge, a minor correction: I would like to thank the three rapporteurs, not two. Mr Pittella also submitted an extremely important report to us; I would therefore like to thank the three rapporteurs for the genuinely constructive cooperation which has accompanied the budgetary procedure this year. I must also thank all those who have approached us from the individual committees with their requests and who, in the majority of cases, in the vast majority of cases, have shown a great deal of understanding for the fact that in a limited framework much is desirable but not everything is possible. We are dealing here with monies which are of course limited, and indeed limited with our approval, but which must reflect the tasks which we have carried out at European level. The European Union budget for the year 2000 is a special budget, not just because it was initiated by the old Parliament, but because there was also a binding interinstitutional agreement which we adopted at the same time and which has had to be continued after the re-election. It is this interinstitutional agreement which restricts us, but which has also opened up additional opportunities for us; I shall come back to this. Thirdly, Budget 2000 is noteworthy because this year we are entering the period of the next Financial Perspective, which runs to 2006, and today we must put down important markers for the coming years. Fourthly, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union is in a situation of facing many new challenges, for example in matters of internal policies, the area of freedom, security and justice, the employment chapter or increased opportunities in health protection and even consumer protection. However, additional tasks also require that we make available the necessary funds, since otherwise it is nothing more than lip service and budgets should not be mere lip service. We must, therefore, clearly define our priorities and make it very clear what they are. We have done this in the past and will do it in the future. Turning to the President-in-Office of the Council, I must say: obviously for us this is about people, people in the form of the taxpayer who must raise what we spend here, but also the people to whom the money must be made available, for whom we are deciding policies. We are not making policies as a game between the Commission, the Council and Parliament for our own benefit, but in order to create the best possible conditions for the development of the European Union and for the people with whom we are dealing. In the past we have placed great importance on the citizens being able to verify that we ensure careful handling of our taxes. In terms of appropriations which concern commitment appropriations, Budget 2000 is lower than the budget 1999. Just go to the finance ministers in your Member States and tell them that they must submit a budget plan which is lower than the plan for the previous year. I would like to see that. That is the first thing we must get on top of. Here we are acting accordingly and anyone should be aware of this if they come to us and say that we only want increases. That is not the case. We handle the money very, very carefully. However, because we are working with and on behalf of people, one of our particular tasks is Category 4, external action. Here the Council has actually come up and said: we want to finance an important future task and an important current task which must be spread over the coming years, i.e. aid for the people of Kosovo. To finance that we are carrying out a 10% cut in all lines.  Mr Böge said that this is visionless and this is a neat term. Are you aware, for example, that in these lines we must then cut by 10% financial aid for Israel and the Palestinian people, i.e. the aid for establishing peace in the region? Are you aware that we must cut by 10% population programmes and funds for combating the scourge of AIDS in developing countries? Are you aware that tackling anti-personnel mines, which is also in our budget lines, will have to be cut by 10%, or that we must cut by 10% measures by non-governmental organisations in developing countries, e.g. for street children in Guatemala or in other regions of the world because we do not want to have any vision, because we do not want to take a close look at where these funds ought to come from? This cannot be the policy which we want to pursue. An across-the-board cut with the lawnmower is indefensible and, therefore, we must and will fight it and we will cite Category 4 as part of the interinstitutional agreement. Although it is difficult, we will observe the other parts of the interinstitutional agreement. We also have problems with other categories, e.g. Category 3, which contains the traditional focal points of our policy: environmental policy, youth training programmes, research and trans-European networks with their possibilities for creating jobs and improving our competitiveness in global dealings. Here also things are very tight because we are outlining ever more tasks but are not getting the necessary funds. We are shifting tasks from national to European level, expressis verbis,
 but then we are not getting the appropriate financial resources. This cannot be a sound policy. We need to discuss this. All the same, within this Category we will not endeavour to increase the funds. Within the interinstitutional agreement, we have established that, in future, agricultural policy too can be definitively co-decided by us. In future, we cannot just promote the production of individual products, but the development of rural areas. This is an extremely important matter for us, and finally, allow me to say something on staffing policy. In this too we have acted extremely responsibly, as in previous years. Except in two central areas, we have not provided for additional jobs. OLAF must be strengthened, whilst the second area concerns veterinary protection and food controls, where we have made a very modest increase of five staff. This much we owe to the people, who demand that we ensure that they have safe food to eat. These, in brief, are the focal points. (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Mr Prodi, in your speech on 21 July 1999 you said that your bywords were transparency, a sense of responsibility and efficiency. It is precisely in the area of budget policy that these three basic principles need to be given concrete expression. If we want to win back the confidence of our citizens, we need transparency regarding the implementation of the EU budget in all its details, a sense of responsibility in handling tax revenue and efficiency in transposing Community budget policies. Clearly, this is a task for the Commission as a whole, all Commissioners and all departments.  In the person of Mrs Schreyer you have introduced us to an experienced politician who still has to find her way around one or two corridors here and go through one or two new experiences at a European level but who is also, however, someone who has become quickly and comprehensively acquainted with the very complicated material of budget policy and who is very aware of the forthcoming challenges of budget policy. She has set out budgetary discipline as being, for her, one of the cardinal virtues. This is praiseworthy stuff. However, we shall also take care to ensure that it is not just a question here of describing new tasks and slipping these into our budget. Instead, we shall need, together with yourself, to go before the Council and say that new tasks require new money. I was gratified to hear Mrs Schreyer say, very undiplomatically, that the distinction between non-compulsory and compulsory funds has to be removed. This would mean equal rights for all parts of the Parliament. A courageous statement like that is worth repeating. She also said that control over revenue needs to be shifted in this direction, something we must set about discussing very soon. I think Mrs Schreyer is among those proposed candidates who will do full justice to their tasks in this Parliament. We shall have no cause – over here at least – to doubt your team.

 Madam President, I would be interested to know how we, or those who come after us, will speak about this problem in ten years’ time, whether we will have become wiser or not. I cannot answer that question today. One thing is certain: security of supply will be improved by more competition; we have always been clear about that. Even competition cannot do that without supply, however, which means, I believe, that security of supply, of natural gas in particular, will depend very much on a European foreign policy for energy, in other words diversification and security of supply through access to gas. Like many others, too, I also advocate proceeding gradually. I believe that, as with oil, the responsibility rests in the first instance with the companies. I imagine that in two years’ time there may be a review and we may be rethinking the present situation. I do not believe we are under any pressure of time.

 Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and I hope that one reading will suffice. I would like to concentrate on just one thing, namely sinks. I disagree on this point. I have just returned from a trip to South America as part of an official delegation. Surprisingly enough, they have been looking very closely at this Linking Directive, at any rate in some of the ministries, and I was repeatedly told how important it is for them that sinks, in other words forestry, should be included. I can see why. If we included forestry, it would be an extraordinarily great help not least in fighting poverty in those countries, or in creating alternatives to drugs in places where they are cultivated. I would also like to mention that just under a year ago France concluded an agreement with Colombia which did include forestry; there is therefore a conflict between Parliament and the Council of Ministers that we will not survive in the long term.

 Madam President, I have to admit that before I entered the European Parliament I was involved with nickel-cadmium batteries for ten years. We even built a factory and I took out a number of patents, which have now expired. I therefore have no economic interests to register. I also have to admit that at the time we did not give much thought to what was to be done with the things later. I therefore believe we are right to be looking at how such batteries can be recycled. I would advise you not to ban things, however, but to introduce alternatives more quickly, and such alternatives exist in theory. Small fuel cells may easily come on the market this year or next and they contain no heavy metals. They also come from the same firms as make nickel-cadmium batteries, at any rate many have experience with them, and that would be my recommendation, instead of rushing straight to a ban.

 Mr President, you may well be surprised to hear me say that, in 25 years’ time, we will be able to derive every bit as much energy from a cubic centimetre of silicon as from a cubic centimetre of uranium, but that is the case – it surprised me, too – and it highlights the enormous potential latent in renewable energies. My second comment has to do with the Bonn conference; I would like to suggest that we in this House should also send a delegation to represent us at it, as a whole array of legislatures from around the world will be doing. It would be a disgrace for the European Parliament not to have a visible presence there in the shape of a group of MEPs with an official mandate. Thirdly, let me say that, in the resolution – to which Mrs Rothe very rightly referred – the term ‘poverty reduction’ occurs twice. I see it as extremely important that we should make the connection between climate policy, energy policy and poverty reduction. For example, the instrument for doing this – or at least one of those that are suitable – is decentralised energy supply systems using renewable energies and another instrument that we are at present discussing in this House, that is, emissions trading, what is termed the Linking Directive. We can be grateful to the Commission for having, some time ago, brought out a very interesting brochure in which it set out the means that could be employed in this way to benefit the renewable energy sector in the Mediterranean region alone. The figures quoted in it are extraordinarily high. I think this is an instrument of which we could make much more use. After all, we have to finance renewable energies, and we all know that they do not come cheap. My final observation must be that what rather worries me about renewable energies is that they are currently going through an upward phase. They are on everyone’s lips, renewable energies get good write-ups in the press, and rightly so too. Who knows, though, what will happen in a couple of years’ time, when the costs go up? Will they be just as acceptable, or will we perhaps come to the conclusion that you can have too much of a good thing, and decide cut back a bit? To do so would be extraordinarily dangerous, for it would inhibit continuity in a sector that forms part of our industrial policy. What this boils down to is that we need continuity, and the small- and medium-sized enterprises that have invested in renewable energy sources need security. (Interruption)
 Yes, costs are falling, but they are, nonetheless, relatively high. I am perfectly familiar with the debates in my own country about the costs of renewable energies. In Germany alone, it is estimated that they will cost us between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion in a couple of years’ time. It may well indeed be that many will see this as a pain barrier through which they do not want to go. I just want to warn that continuity should be maintained rather than broken if those who invest in them today are to have security.

 Mr President, I am almost tempted to start a debate with Mr Langen on moratoriums; I opposed moratoriums in biotechnology, and I would be against one in this case too. I would prefer, though, to concentrate on research, for we need a policy on it if the European economy is to be competitive. The astonishing thing is that this is an area about which we are all agreed, and yet, especially in the Member States, it has experienced cutbacks over recent years. Most spectacularly of all, in France – for the first time in Europe – researchers are even taking to the streets, and their counterparts elsewhere are perfectly prepared to do likewise, so it is not just the farmers who are demonstrating; the researchers are obviously doing it too. I see that as interesting, but also regrettable, for this makes it quite plain how the high-flown utterances of Heads of State or Government contrast with the austerity of their actions. Now, along come the finance ministers and tell us that there is no money. The question is, though, whether we cannot do any research because we have no money, or whether we have no money because we are not doing any research. To take just one Member State as an example, Finland shows us very clearly how it is possible, even when times are hard, to succeed by investing in the future. Today, Finland keeps on being hailed as the highest-achieving country in the European Union, and it has not even been a Member State for that long. What this means is that Finland has done a great deal, even without the European Union. So I would urge us in this House to keep on track in campaigning for the 3% expenditure on research and for the launching of an innovation strategy for small- and medium-sized enterprises. I will conclude by urging Members to this House to be present at the Science Convention that we intend to organise in Brussels for early April, in order to make it clear that this strategy still enjoys support from this House, at least.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs most warmly for these reports, as also all those who played their part in preparing this debate. I would, though, also like to thank the Commission, for in my many years in this House – almost twenty-five of them so far – never before has a Commission dared to put its head as far above the parapet as this one when it comes to the safety of nuclear power stations and the safe disposal of radioactive waste. I really would like to thank you for that. I see that as progress, as an advance on what we have had up to now, for a remarkable contradiction is apparent. On the one hand, one cannot deny that there are of course such things as radioactive risks and that these are transnational in nature, but, on the other, we refuse to acknowledge that these transnational risks need to be managed on a European basis. These directives do nothing to resolve that contradiction, but we have, all the same, moved on a bit. It is for that reason that I favour a directive rather than the recommendation that some Member States are demanding, some of them with very different considerations in mind. Not the least reason why I favour a directive is that it will be capable of being extended in future. Admittedly, as many have already said, these directives leave responsibility with the Member States, but, as things stand today, that makes sense and that should be affirmed; directives do have the advantage that the responsibility, being with the national governments, will become more transparent in future. What that means is that we – or rather those of us who will be re-elected – will have the opportunity to hold, in this House, a debate on inspection reports. My next point is a brief one on the Vidal-Quadras Roca report: what is waste? There has been much discussion of the way in which waste has been defined in an actually political way, which the Commission text has also done to some extent, in other words, that waste is waste if it is not reused. Physically speaking, though, it can indeed be reused, and that is why retrieval is extraordinarily important. It may very well be that, in a century or two’s time, what is now waste will perhaps again become fuel; it is certainly feasible in terms of the physics involved. As we should leave future generations that option, retrieval must be a possibility. I might add that this should also be done for ecological reasons; we may well not believe this to be possible, but one day it may be that. Next, let me turn to reduction – of waste, of volume, of toxicity – and I would like to address something that we have not discussed in this House, but that we certainly will have to discuss in the future, namely the transmutation of long-life isotopes. It is, in principle, very definitely possible for transmutation to reduce the half-life of long-life isotopes, especially the minor actinides, and also the volume of these pollutants or of this waste, so that less toxic matter has to be finally stored. Interestingly enough, though, this requires research, and a new generation of technology, and the possibility cannot be excluded of this becoming part of the technologies and philosophy intrinsic to and incorporated in the reactor, perhaps in the fourth generation of nuclear power stations. Although I mention this only in passing, that too is not something that should be ruled out. Work is in any case being done on it and on Generation 4, and the Commission is playing its part in it. The next point to which we had to devote a great deal of attention, is the funds issue, that is, of how the decommissioning of a power station or installation is to be funded. What we have now got presented to us by the Council is a much-reduced form of this, and it is probable that a majority of this House will vote in favour of it. Whilst I think that is sensible, one question that will not thereby be resolved is that of competition, in view of there being not only the Euratom Treaty, but also the competition articles. It may well be that someone will realise, and point out, that there are enterprises that have to put aside a lot of money for these funds, whilst others get funding from their governments; does this not put at a competitive disadvantage those who put money into these funds? The directive makes no reference to anything of the sort, and I do not suppose that this is what the Council of Ministers intended, but I am certain that this issue will again need to be discussed in the next few years. All in all, I see this debate and the directive as progress, and hope that we will, tomorrow, adopt the reports by a large majority.

 Mr President, just a few words on the support measures: to be sure, past decades have seen a lot of money poured into the promotion of nuclear energy, just, incidentally, as it is today into renewable energies. I think that is right. If you put that in terms of kilowatt-hours, in the case of nuclear power, the amount is down in the one-thousandths, whilst, with renewable energy, we are talking about tens of cents. I am not saying that I am against it; I just want to make the proportions clear. Tomorrow, the issue of the Euratom loans will probably boil down to the question of whether we should support nuclear power stations in the course of construction or those that are being used, on which subject the only thing I have to say is that we are indirectly supporting nuclear energy in Russia by buying more and more gas from the Russians. Russia will be unable to supply much of this gas in future unless it cuts back on gas at home, which will be replaced by electricity from coal-fired power stations and from nuclear power stations that are being built. Perhaps we should give some thought to that when we talk about a European energy strategy. Our increased use of gas does, it is true, mean that we are improving our record on CO2-emissions, but elsewhere, more CO2 is being produced from coal-burning power stations, or nuclear power is being promoted. That is something else we should bear in mind; it shows that our own energy strategy is not always consistent. I believe that we should vote in favour of these Euratom loans, quite simply because of the improvement in safety. It was for this reason that the Council of Ministers, after Chernobyl, increased the funding for Euratom loans. I believe that the argument still holds water today.

 Mr President, my report is less controversial, but, I believe, no less significant. It makes the simple claim that Europe must invest more in research. The proportion of Europe’s gross domestic product devoted to research expenditure is to increase to 3% by 2010; one-third must be raised from public funds, and two-thirds to be contributed by industry. Only in this way can the European Union become the most competitive region in the world, which is what Europe’s Heads of State or Government called for in Lisbon as many as three years ago. The Commission endorses this call and has calculated that, by 2010, industry’s expenditure on research will have to increase by 9% per annum, and the public contribution by 6% per annum, if this target is to be reached. We are nowhere near doing that. Even though the EU is more populous, the USA spends USD 140 billion more every year on research; the National Institute of Health, which deals solely with medicine as a life science, has USD 28 billion at its disposal – more than the whole of the rest of the world spends in this field. Its budget has doubled over the past five years, and, in 2004, it will be getting another billion dollars, itself equivalent to over two-thirds of the budget of the German Research Foundation. The National Science Foundation will also have its funding increased by 6%. The USA is not alone, though, in increasing its expenditure on research, which is already at a high level; Japan has sharply increased its spending on research, even though its economy is flagging. In 1997, all parties in the Japanese parliament joined in taking the initiative in adopting a ten-year plan, with substantial rates of increase to encourage young scientists. Canada, which was facing economic recession some years ago, has consciously invested in science and technology and is now reaping the economic rewards of its efforts. In the past year alone, the sum of CAD 800 million was made available for the purpose of attracting foreign professors to the country. In Europe, by contrast, spending has been static and has, in some countries, even been reduced; despite all their pious utterances, most EU countries are cutting back on education and research. Fewer and fewer students are interested in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology. Enterprises are moving their research to the USA. UNICE is already talking in terms of the threat of de-industrialisation. To be sure, there are exceptions: Sweden and Finland are showing us what everyone should be doing. Why is it, though, that it is the larger countries that are neglecting research? I have just received a letter from Italy, where a competition was held to appoint 1 600 scientists to university posts. They have now spent two whole years waiting to be appointed because the funding has not been made available. Surely, though, this cannot be just about money; after all, we spend a lot of money on subsidising all sorts of things, including EUR 900 million from our budget for tobacco cultivation alone. It is evident that what we lack is not money but the right priorities; it is in the past that we invest rather than in the future. What is to be done? We have to change course, or else our repeatedly calling for a knowledge-based society in Europe will become a sad joke, and then nobody will take the EU seriously any more. It will be seen as a tired and enfeebled colossus, a continent filled with boastful babble, fragile and old, nothing more than a historical museum. I therefore have three demands to make in the hope that Parliament, the Commission and Council will endorse them. Firstly, there must be an increase in private-sector expenditure on research; a rate of increase of 9% per annum would be feasible if we were to do as the Commission communication on research policy recommends. To do that, we have to try every incentive, including tax exemption. Secondly, we have to increase public expenditure. What this means for the EU’s research budget is that the Seventh Research Framework Programme must run to at least EUR 30 billion. I might add, by the way, that this figure corresponds to the annual increase of 6% for public-sector research expenditure that I have called for and takes account of the growth in the EU’s size. Thirdly, the EU should act on the advice of the scientific organisations and set up a European Research Council, from whose resources basic research would be funded. If we are to change course, the new policy has to be set out, so I suggest that we hold, before the European elections, a European Scientific Congress in Brussels or Strasbourg. Enough has been written, enough has been said; the Commission, too, has presented a convincing document. Enough of statements of intent; now is the time for action. (Applause)

 Mr President, we have had many discussions on space travel before, and I am glad that the subject is now accorded much greater importance in European debate than was the case ten years ago. I might add, with all modesty, that this House can take the credit for this. We grasped the strategic significance of space, but also the fact that very little money is to be made from it, so that means that space travel needs to be supported by public funds, but what will certainly show a profit in the years to come will be the activities derived from space travel in the fields of telecommunications, measuring techniques, and so on, which we have often discussed. There is no future for space travel, though, without carriers in the form of satellites, if – let me add – there is no manned spaceflight. In Cologne, there is now a centre providing training for astronauts. Our disagreements are in fact not so much about the purpose of space travel – about which I believe there to be broad consensus – as about its military aspects, which are a new factor. Let me say that I do not think that we should shy away from this issue, as – in contrast to ten or twenty years ago – Europe now has its Foreign and Security Policy. We cannot separate one from the other. I will admit that I find learning rather difficult, but one is never too old to learn more, and so I would very much urge that particular attention be given to this aspect.

 Madam President, let me start by saying that, two or three years ago, I prepared a report on the European Union’s oil supplies, and I have to admit that what I asked for then was the same thing as what the Commission is calling for now. At that time, I called for the reserves to be increased in order to be on the safe side in the event of supplies being interrupted. That sounds like a plausible thing to do, and that, in any case, was the policy we introduced in 1974. I have, however, learned in the meantime that any benefit from this bears no relation to the cost involved, and the United States’ experience with its Strategic Petroleum Reserve demonstrates that emptying the reserves has remarkably little effect on steeply rising prices. That should give us pause for thought. What this means is that costs are running high and the benefit to us is relatively small, so I would like to say that I agree with my fellow-Members that this is perhaps not the right road to take. Perhaps we would have something different to say if supplies really had been interrupted; we would probably be in a state of shock and attacking the Commission, asking why it had not responded to a crisis situation of this kind. The only thing is that I see such a situation as highly unlikely. It is far more probable that the greatest risk is the economic one set out by the Commission itself in its proposal, that of prices rising, probably creeping upwards. That is what our main problem will be with gas over the next ten or twenty years. The end result of Europe’s increasing dependency on gas will be a slow rise in prices, which we will be completely unable to influence unless, in twenty years’ time, we have managed to persuade the Russians to be nice to us and reduce them. That will be the real problem. Dealing with it will require, not a directive such as this one, but dialogue with Russia and also with OPEC. That is what the Commission has already made a start on, and that makes a lot of sense. I would like to close with an observation on the networks. If we extend the networks, as we plan to do, the effect of this will be similar to that of maintaining reserves, as networks – the ones for gas, at any rate – are a sort of reserve, and extending them produces the same effect. That, thank God is a point on which we can agree.

 Mr President, it was quite remarkable how the Commission and Parliament were able to reach a tidy compromise under the providential leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva. I think it is also an expression of European identity, because climate policy has a good name in Europe. May it continue to do so. When it comes to emissions trading, we must be careful not to confuse two things. Trading in emissions does not save one tonne of CO2; that is only saved by investment. But emissions trading encourages investment, that is to say it triggers a search for the cheapest way of cutting CO2. It is also sensible from an economic point of view and industry and many government leaders, many of whom still find emissions trading strange, need to see that. Secondly, Mr Seppänen – and, to some extent, Mr Lange as well – have rightly pointed out that a few questions are still unanswered. For example, are emissions rights securities? How are they treated? These are questions for which an answer will probably have to be found in the future, at either national or European level. As regards cost factors for undertakings, Mr Lange is quite right to say that undertakings’ balance sheets will probably look different in future than they do today, especially if CO2 costs more than it does today. Today it costs EUR 5 to EUR 6 a tonne. Once it costs EUR 20 to 30 a tonne, the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy. Let us hope that these will be the ones we are looking for, namely cuts in CO2.

 Mr President, let me start by saying something to my friend and colleague Mr Désir, who spoke before me because he had a plane to catch. Much as I respect him, the great majority of our group backs this resolution, this compromise that we have reached. I might add that we also take the view that this directive safeguards the service publique 
or – as we would say – services of general interest. Indeed, what results from it is a new legal certainty. Services of general interest are compatible with competition, and, should the public interest so require it, the Member States will also be able to decide on derogations from the law on competition. What the French may, however, find painful is the fact that péréquation
 will come to an end, so that prices will not be the same everywhere, but I wonder what disadvantage is involved in the possibility of prices falling in one part of a country? That is precisely the effect we intend competition to have. I would remind you, by the way, that one of the reasons why we started this debate on the liberalisation of energy markets at the beginning of the 1990s was that prices in Europe were very high, so that it was not only the companies, but also we ourselves, who were complaining that we were at a competitive disadvantage against the USA, our main competitor. These directives, in fact, represent the end of a long process. Having been in this House for a long time, let me point out that this process actually began at the end of the 1980s – with the absurd variation, incidentally, that the White Paper on the internal market made no mention of energy – and that, at that time, it was by way of the European Court of Justice that the attempt was made to open up the internal market. We said at the time that we did not want to leave the opening-up of the market to judges, but wanted to make it a political process, and that political process has now been concluded at European level by the resolution on these directives. What comes next? That is the question. Transposing this directive into law will not be straightforward. It will affect the companies, and – as national enterprises become European enterprises – the work of trade unions as well. This liberalisation will entail new legislative tasks, especially as regards our obligations in the areas of environmental and climate policy. We will also have the important task of introducing elements of these into liberalisation, in that it will be a new task to make climate policy compatible with competition policy as embodied in these two directives. It will, not least, be important to involve the candidate countries in this process. I too would like to end by thanking all those who have played their part in this. Let me say this: it is not often that we work together in such a collegial fashion!

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that is an extraordinarily bright idea, but we will first have to read your document and see what is proposed in detail. I could envisage us concluding treaties with the states surrounding the European Union, and all the technical integral parts of the Treaty on European Union or of our future constitution then applying to these states as well, so that – in the area of energy, for example – these states would have a share in the liberalisation of the energy market, in the projects for trans-European networks, and so on. If that is what it is to boil down to, then it is a very good idea. I do, though, see this as raising a number of questions, to some of which you have referred. For a start, why, if there is to be cooperation with the Mediterranean – for the thing is called Euromed – then why not with Russia and with other states? Why, in point of fact, is this cooperation to be only in the field of energy? Are there no other integral parts of the Treaty that could be used in exactly the same way? It is unfortunate that we will then, in accordance with our own Euratom Treaty, always have to divide our activities into nuclear and non-nuclear, so it would appear that we need two different treaties. Far from the least important question is whether this sort of cooperation in competition – and competition is what this is about – has to be backed up by joint undertakings in research, and whether there is also financial support for one project or another. So I look forward with eager expectation to what you are going to put before us on this; perhaps you could respond to one or other of these questions right now? As I have said, I think this is a brilliant idea, one that needs specific elements added to it. I am sure that we will have discussions on that in Parliament as well.

 I do not want to be a bore, but, as you said I had not put a question, let me ask what response we have had from these countries. Are they interested in such a solution? I am sure you have had talks with some of them. Perhaps you could say something further on the subject.

 Mr President, the worst thing about this situation in Venezuela is that the two sides have stopped talking to each other. Their inability to enter into a dialogue is causing society, and even the State itself to fragment, leaving behind a vacuum that other undemocratic groups are only too eager to fill. At this stage I should therefore like to draw your attention to the fact that an initiative has emerged from the Latin American Parliament and the European Parliament to form a joint group, to establish a dialogue with Members of Parliament on both sides in Venezuela and in this way also to support the efforts of the Group of Friends of Venezuela to bring the two sides together. I hope that it will eventually be possible for us to build this bridge. Incidentally, I suspect that given the current crisis in Iraq, the longer this conflict lasts the more likely it is that the oil involved will lead the United States to call for action to be taken. The fact that well over 10% of America's oil comes from Venezuela is not without its consequences for them, or for the other countries of Latin America either, because rises in the price of oil are due, at least in part, to the situation in Venezuela. The man in the street in the countries of Latin America is the one who will pay. Apart from getting the two sides talking, what else is to be done? I think that sooner or later we will have no alternative but to let the people decide. Here, though, I think it is important to keep the constitution as a basis, because despite all of its shortcomings the validity of this constitution has not been contested. Latin America's reputation for not respecting constitutions goes before it. This is all the more reason for us to ensure that where a constitution is actually recognised at international level, we do stick to it. If it is to be amended then it should be with the agreement of both sides to perhaps enable elections to be held at an early stage. But as I see it the only way out seems to be for the people to decide, and no one else! (Applause)

 Mr President, I can well imagine that the Commissioner is right about depleted uranium. As far as I am aware, and if my memory serves me right, it even has its civilian uses, but that is something that would have to be checked. However, as we know nothing about what long-term effects the dispersed material may have, there may be some surprises in store for us. I would like to say something about landmines. What we have to know about landmines that some 230 million of them are currently stored in a number of countries. Between 70 and 100 million of them have been laid around the world. It is unfortunate, moreover, that new ones are being laid all the time, so that great significance attaches to the issue of how we locate these landmines and destroy them, primarily in human terms – that is, about ensuring that people do not get hurt in the process – but also in economic terms – that is, about keeping costs down. I would like to encourage the Commission to make the right use of the funds that we have inserted in the Budget for research purposes. In recent years, we have kept on adding funds to the research framework programme for the purpose of researching new technologies for locating landmines, so they should be used for that purpose. Progress has been made, and for that I want to express my gratitude, but these things are extraordinarily complex, and I would like again to encourage you to help, perhaps by developing some sort of multifunctional location device. For my final comment, I turn to disarmament. There are other things – weapons of mass destruction, for example – that have to be disposed of. Every year, our Budget allocates some EUR 100 million to the disposal of chemical, biological and atomic weapons in the countries that formerly made up the Soviet Union. I would like you to submit a report on this, and for us to have a debate on it or produce a statement on the subject. After all, a great deal of money is involved and this is, above all, very much a live issue.

 Mr President, I just wanted to tell Mr Lang that opening itself up to world markets has paid off for Chile. Living standards have gone up, Chile's growth rate is far higher than that of other Latin American countries, and I just hope that this policy catches on in them as well. What I would like to say to Commissioner Patten is that we are already engaged in active cooperation with members of Chile's parliament. We had a meeting with them here in Strasbourg as long ago as the autumn – even before the Agreement was ratified – and had, surprisingly enough, an extraordinarily lively debate with the Chilean Congress and House of Deputies. The problem we now have is not with the treaty. The treaty is excellent, and I also wish to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his superlative report. There is a treaty, but it must not be allowed to remain an empty form of words. It has to be filled out – with something real. Let me, by the way, remind you of the fact that we also have a scientific agreement with Chile. If that is not to remain a mere formality, it too has to be filled out, and that is what I want to urge us to do. Money is needed if that is to be done, but money is not the most important thing. If that is to be done, the main thing we will need is will, the will of the European institutions, but also the will of enterprises and organisations. What I hope at the end of the day is that this Agreement, whose objective is also very strongly political, will contribute to Latin America growing together, will contribute to stronger relationships between Europe and Latin America, and, above all, that cooperation with Chile will help to overcome the conflicts in certain Latin American countries, some of which conflicts – in Colombia, for example – are raging openly.

Mr President, you have given me a keynote to use. Of all those who have spoken so far, I live the furthest to the south, and if it was not for the Alps, I would have a clear view of the Mediterranean. So I claim the right to speak on behalf of the Members from the South and to assert that we too have an interest in the North's well being. I take it for granted that you, Mr President, agree with me! I would like to be brief and to touch on the following topics, the first of which is energy. What matters here is that the Baltic Ring should at last come into being, with an electricity interconnection right round the Baltic. That would be a great help to us and also to the Baltic States. The second point I want to make is that we must at all cost prevent any mishap involving oil or gas in the far north. It would take many years for nature to recover, far longer than would be the case in the south. That is something we must avoid come what may. My third point is the main one: disarmament. Quite a bit has already been said about the submarines that are rusting away in north-western Russia and the plans we have for dealing with them, for which I would like to give the Commission every credit. I do, though, want to suggest to the Commission that they should make a statement setting out what disarmament measures they and the Council are jointly considering, what has been decided on, and what is being done through our Budget, so that this House can have a debate on all these measures, which we are co-financing. The Commission deserves thanks for having organised a major disarmament conference in Brussels at the beginning of December, which I attended, and I am amazed at the vast number of initiatives that there are. It is only right, though, that this House should discuss them and make them known to a wider public. If I might return to the subject of energy, I would like to bring a paradox to your attention. Here in Western Europe, we are replacing coal and atomic power with gas, which we will, in future, be buying increasingly from Russia. The Russians are selling us more and more gas, because it earns them more money than if they use the gas at home – where, however, they are using coal and atomic power instead. Taking all these things together, then, no savings are being made either in atomic power or in CO2. I ask that we in this House should take seriously the question of whether our policy is the right one, and that this issue should be on the agenda for the dialogue with the Russians on energy. What is going on here is quite simply absurd, at any rate from an outsider's point of view. I just wanted to point that out.

 Mr President, I fully endorse the previous speakers' comments, and I assume that there will be a majority in favour of the Damião report tomorrow. There are many reasons for this. The Commissioner is absolutely right to describe biotechnology as the undoubted key to the future. Some have grasped this already; others will take longer to do so, but it is undoubtedly the case. Mr Liese is absolutely right: biotechnology will also help us find solutions for sustainable development. I would like to add an explanation here, for biotechnology does not work with 'classical' thermodynamics, but with irreversible thermodynamics; in other words, it works with very small potential differences to produce a very substantial impact. Otherwise, we would not grow old, but would leave this mortal coil at the age of 15. In other words, biotechnology has many benefits, and this is widely recognised. Indeed, 'red' biotechnology is already recognised by large sections of the Green Party today. The problem is this: how do we deal with green biotechnology? This may also have to do with the fact that many people in Europe say that they do not need it; they say they have enough to eat, and the problem is distribution, not new products. There is a very different view in the developing countries, however. For example, if I have a product which can be produced using a minimum amount of water, or have a species of rice which contains specific vitamins, this is a matter of survival for many people in the developing countries. It does not matter to us, because we can buy other products with our large amounts of money. What does this mean in practice? It means that the development of biotechnology, including green biotechnology, in Europe could help many other people. Let me clear up one misunderstanding at this point, which has also played a role in our own group. It has been claimed that we aim to combat hunger in the world with biotechnology. This is not what is said here. What we say is that biotechnology alone cannot defeat hunger in the world, and that other measures, such as better distribution of the food available, are far more important. That is what it says here. Let me clear up this misunderstanding from the outset. However, biotechnology can make its contribution to reducing hunger in the world. Let me conclude with one further comment: our conflict here in this House is not that we will reject the Damião report tomorrow, but that we will vote differently during the legislative process. This is why I call on everyone to conduct a much more far-reaching dialogue here in this House, and with the Commission, on these issues. Otherwise we will continue to live with this dichotomy, which we are finding so difficult to cope with. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate policy is a process that will inform everything we do in the twenty-first century and I trust that Europe will continue to play a leading role here. I have something to say to the members of the parliaments. We have more and more global processes, not just now with Kyoto, but on other issues – I am thinking of the International Monetary Fund, financial policy, worldwide credit policy, environmental policy and trade policy – which are in fact decided solely by the executive. The parliaments rubberstamp them, they have no choice. The question is: surely, with increasing globalisation, parliaments could be more involved in the opinion-forming process? This question is directed both to us and to our parliaments. We need to find new ways of working together instead of just taking recourse to the executive – in this case the Commission. Secondly, Kyoto must be ratified and that will be our main job in New Delhi. We must convince our counterparts, especially our Russian counterparts, that this makes sense. Thirdly, when we talk of reducing CO2 – and other greenhouse gas emissions, but mainly CO2 – we always mention renewable energy in the same breath. And so we should. I have no wish to contradict that. It is just that, in New Delhi, we will be in a country that generates well over 50% of its electricity from coal. If they could bring their coal technology up to current European standards, we would save much, much more CO2 throughout the world than with all the other very costly reduction measures put together. This is a fact and we must face it. In other words, if we want a climate policy, we need an active coal policy and we should mention that in the same breath as renewable energy, because 80% of the world's energy is still generated from fossil fuels. Finally, I think that climate policy also gives us a chance to foster a new relationship with developing countries, in the form of emissions trading. The Commission itself conducted a very interesting study in its institute in Seville, with a time frame of up to 2030, when, it states, emissions trading with Asia will be worth around EUR 80 billion. That implies a capital inflow of around EUR 80 billion for these countries. Know-how will be transmitted to these countries and the advantage to us is that the reduction in emissions will be entered against our account, meaning that both sides will benefit from the trade off. We should be thinking more along these lines.

 Mr President, if I had more than two minutes at my disposal, I would, in the most amicable way possible, demolish Mr Langen's arguments. I do believe that the Commission has produced a thoroughly good draft, which I am sure we have improved, because Parliament always does everything better. I want to make the following points. Firstly, we already have a trade in emissions; across the world, some 70 million tonnes of CO2 have been traded since 1996, at – let us assume – a price of USD 3 per tonne, amounting to USD 210 million worth of business, and the trade is increasing at an exponential rate. There has to be some order in this trade, and, in Europe, this directive helps us to do that. That is why it makes sense. I am very much in favour of past experience in the Member States being taken into account, which means that we need a transitional period, but one that must come to an end. As far as I am concerned, 2008 is that end, when the same rule must apply across Europe. I also want to point out that European competition law still applies to trading in emissions, and – Kyoto notwithstanding – the Commission can always intervene in the market if it believes that competition is being distorted. This trade in emissions is in fact ushering in a new era in our economy, as waste gases – CO2 in this instance – are having a price put on them. Where that price is estimated – the Commission is assuming EUR 20 per tonne – one can very readily imagine what significance this will have for the economy, for the energy sector, and for ecology. We really are coming up to a paradigm shift, and, that being so, I am sure that this will not be the last debate on this subject. I hope that Parliament's resolution will after all be the basis of a rapprochement between us, enabling us to come up with a solution that makes sense.

 Madam President, if I am not mistaken, Parliament and the Commission agree on the essential points: trade barriers need to be dismantled, integration needs to be fostered, Europe needs to speak with one voice in the IMF, and so on. I do not wish to repeat it all. I should just like to make two short comments and refer to Mr Patten's final remarks. Firstly, I have been working on Latin America for many years and – to my horror, I have to say – I have observed that Latin America's importance on the world stage is diminishing further every year, while Asia's is growing. There must be reasons for this, reasons that are far more complex than just a measure or two. We should discuss this openly. The second comment that I wanted to make concerns a survey that was carried out recently in Latin America. Part of the population – around 20 000 people – were asked whether they believed that authoritarian governments were better able to solve the problems than democracies. In 1996 in a similar survey only a minority put an authoritarian regime first; the majority was in favour of democracy. Today over 50% of the population are saying: yes, we need authoritarian governments to solve our problems. This means that the crisis that we are facing today in Latin America, and in particular in Mercosur, also presents a risk to democracy. This reminds me of the eighties and early nineties when our debates on Latin America mainly concerned democracy. At that time we understood that we needed to pursue a social and economic policy that restored people's faith in democracy. That is why I do not think that it is pointless for us to concern ourselves with Latin America; if we do not then we will only end up drafting more motions on dictatorships. (Applause)

Mr President, to follow on from what you just said, a very good morning. Perhaps this is also a sign of the new start which we are planning with the sixth research framework programme. My thanks also to the rapporteur. I do not say that merely as a courtesy because I think we have worked well together and have basically followed the rapporteur's line and I should like to make a point of thanking her for her initiative. As far as these rules of participation are concerned, I would like to say that we have put a great deal of responsibility on the Commission and demanded a great deal from it. I do not envy the Commission its task, because it will be no easy matter to implement the sixth research framework programme; you only have to think of the provision requiring the Commission to give reasons for any decision rejecting a proposal. That is one of our old demands, but with several tens of thousands of projects, it places an enormous responsibility on the Commission. If it succeeds here, my hat off to it, because this is certainly one reason why many people are still just as enthusiastic about taking part in the European research programme. But it will not be easy. The main difficulty with this sixth research framework programme is that so many Member States are taking part in it – fifteen Member States, plus the countries which want to join the European Union, plus the countries in the European Economic Area, plus Israel and, in the future, Switzerland too. In other words, there are a great many participants and "managing" them, by which I mean implementing the research framework programme properly, will be no easy task. I also understand why it wants to encourage projects, networks of excellence, integrated projects etc. which are as big as possible and presumably this will also be the future of the European research programme. However, this means that other, mainly smaller projects will increasingly need to be taken over by the Member States and the regions, leading to a stricter division of labour between the European Union and the Member States. I am absolutely delighted that the matter of the two-stage procedure has been described in greater detail. I expect this two-stage procedure to lighten the load somewhat, depending on how it is implemented. The Commission has a certain amount of experience here and I trust it will be able to improve on it. The faster we implement the sixth research framework programme, the more money we shall save. Parliament has made its contribution, and there is a consensus in favour. The thing now is to hand out the money as quickly as possible and I wish you every success in doing so, Commissioner.

Mr President, as is only right, Parliament is largely united on this issue. No doubt, any problems are on the Council's side, and I only hope that we do not have a repeat of what happened many years ago when Mrs Scrivener, who was a Commissioner at the time, submitted a similar package and the Council ended up rejecting it. I hope there will be a better outcome this time. A number of speakers have rightly pointed out that there are cheaper ways of making CO2 avoidable, and there can hardly be any dispute about that. On the other hand, biofuels have a range of advantages to offer that should not be underestimated. As we produce biofuels, so our energy dependence will diminish. I believe that the burden they will lift from agricultural policy is an argument that will carry particular weight in consequence of the addition of the countries of Eastern Europe to the enlarged EU. I speak as someone who has had a certain amount to do with technology when I say, thirdly, that I believe it will give technology a certain boost, in that new processes and techniques will be developed, and businesses can rest secure in the knowledge that they will be supported throughout the years that they are working on biofuels, as is only right and proper. I want, though, to draw attention to two things that this directive will certainly bring in its wake, and which – as I have already said in committee – will not be to everyone's liking. The biofuels directive will of course increase biologists' desire to create more efficient renewable raw materials with a low environmental impact, and step up their efforts at doing so. That should not be forgotten. We will also have to import biofuels, which means that Europe will become a new market for countries such as Brazil, Argentina and the USA, and we should be careful not just to create a market for others, but also a market for ourselves.

Mr President, may I say to the President-in-Office that he should not be deceived by the number of empty seats in the House. We have a great deal of interest in Latin America. Perhaps we are behaving like a semi-conductor. Sometimes, the more empty positions, the higher the standard. Maybe that also applies to Parliament. I should like to join with Mr Fernández Martín in asking the Commission to speed up the implementation of projects. When we parliamentarians visit Latin America, the response to our proposals is always, yes, you make excellent proposals, you decide to give us money, but the money never comes. The credibility of the European Union does not depend on a to-do list, but on whether or not we keep our promises. So my request – and I assume I speak here for the whole House – is that the projects be implemented. That the money we budget be disbursed. Thirdly, and this comment is addressed to the Latin Americans with us now, the more Latin America joins forces, the more Mercosur and the Andes countries and the whole of Latin America joins forces, the more clout they will have in negotiations with the European Union and other countries. Take a leaf – and this really is meant as well-intentioned advice – out of the European Union's book in this case. The problem for us in negotiations with Mercosur and other regions is that we have to listen to several, rather than one voice. And, whether we like it or not, it slows down the negotiating process. I personally am not involved in negotiations, but several people have told me as much. It would be better if you were to speak with one voice. I should also like to say how delighted I was with the Mercosur-Europe Business Forum which was held in parallel in Madrid. This is the third time this forum of companies, associations and politicians from Mercosur and Europe has been staged. We need economic and technical dialogue between Europe and Latin America similar to our dialogue with the United States. Perhaps the Commission could make a contribution here too. My last comment is that there are numerous problems, but there are also opportunities waiting to be exploited. In Parliament, we are currently processing several directives which will offer trading opportunities: a directive on biofuels – where we can offer them new markets – and a directive on CO2 emissions trading in the wake of the Kyoto agreement. This too offers new opportunities for collaboration, to Latin America's advantage. All this deserves to be discussed.

Mr President, Madrid is a summit of Heads of State and Government. But may I take this opportunity to point out in all modesty that the European Parliament has cultivated very close relations with Latin American parliamentarians for years now; in fact, the longest-standing relations between the European Parliament and other parliaments are with Latin America and date back to the early 1970s. How Latin America develops over the coming years and decades will also depend to a very considerable degree on its relations with Europe. I think that we underestimate our potential. I should like to make the point here that relations with Latin America must, above all, include a scientific and technical dimension, an industrial dimension, as we have with the United States –why not with Latin America as well? May I remind you that Europe's two biggest scientific institutes are in Latin America: the ESO or European Southern Observatory in Chile, which has done a great deal for astrophysics in Chile, and our space centre in Kourou, because French Guyana is also on Latin American soil. I also advocate intensive dialogue involving industry in Europe and Latin America. Something along these lines began with Mercosur and could be extended to the whole of Latin America. Mr Patten rightly referred to Kyoto and climate policy. If I had the time, I could work out what emissions trading might mean in the future for Latin America. The President has signalled to me that I do not have the time. If I did, I would work it out for you and you would be astounded at the possibilities it encompasses. In short, we have a great many opportunities for relations with Latin America. We must use them, not just talk about them! (Applause)

 Mr President, this is a great piece of work, and I would like to thank Mr Caudron most warmly, as well as Mr Busquin, who has left his mark on this programme with new ideas. I wish him great success in implementing this programme. It will not be easy to manage and implement such a large programme, with not only the fifteen Member States, but also other states taking part in it. We wish you good luck on the way ahead, in any case. I note with great satisfaction that two issues which I have put forward again and again have been included, the first of these being research into improved methods of clearing away anti-personnel mines. I would ask the Commission to keep these efforts under one roof if at all possible. The second is the issue of disarmament, a contribution towards the abolition of nuclear, bacteriological and chemical weapons, a technical contribution to their destruction. Open today's newspapers and you read about how the two former superpowers are disposing of the heritage of the Cold War, that is, they want to disarm on a really massive scale. If the European Union were to join them in this, that would be a noble endeavour. We have achieved a compromise on the ethics issue. The Commission has issued a statement which corresponds in essence to what Parliament resolved at first reading. I would ask that we bring forward discourse on the finality of science, and also on ethics in Europe. The actual problem is not with the Council, Parliament, or the Commission, but with different publicly-expressed opinions. Playing a part in bringing forward the broadest possible public debate on the purpose, content, and finality of science and technology in Europe would be important and should become fundamental as the Sixth Framework Programme progresses. In saying this, I would like to give you an assurance that Parliament is interested in this. Being myself a co-founder of STOA, I am aware of the importance of the task of technological assessment, and hope that we will work well with the Commission.

 Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteurs very much for all of their preparatory work. In my opinion, the debate or discussion about these directives and regulations has been a good example of how together we can get to grips with a complicated issue at least enough to know where we concur and where our views differ. Incidentally, I should like to recall that at the end of the eighties, when the Commission published its White Paper on the internal market, energy was not even mentioned, which shows that we are dealing with an extremely complicated matter here. At the time there were many who said, hands off, that is far too complicated, we in the electricity and gas industry understand this much better, let us deal with it. We chose another route and I believe that competition is indeed the right way forward. I am also in favour of our establishing unrestricted competition. Incidentally, if we did not do this, in the end the European Court of Justice would probably force us to change the way we do certain things, for example to recognise that the customer is the domestic customer and not a customer defined by us. You see the Treaty always carries more weight than any Parliament resolution. I should, however, also like to advocate that we not only deregulate, but also regulate. What we are doing here is actually regulated deregulation, if I am allowed to say that. But that is precisely what it is. We are not only opening up the market in gas and electricity, we are also setting the conditions – the environmental and social conditions – under which this will take place, or we are leaving it up to the Member States to do so by enacting their own regulations. I believe that these are two sides of the same coin. This is perhaps where we differ, Mr van Velzen, in our assessment of these directives. Neither do I regard this as complicating the process; I think it is part of it. We need a market and we need regulated competition, but energy is also something to which the public has a right. Security of supply must be established and the environmental conditions must be set. This is an integral part of this directive. The opening up of the energy markets is also a fundamental prerequisite for the functioning of the Kyoto Protocol. Without competition and without an open market, we will not be able to have emissions trading in Europe. This is part of the Kyoto Protocol, which, after all, almost all of us wish to ratify.
Linkohr (PSE

Madam President, it is quite remarkable how Parliament is united across the boundaries of group and nation on this issue, and the Commission and the Council, too, are of the same opinion, that we want to ratify Kyoto. I hope that tomorrow's vote will see us achieve the greatest possible majority and perhaps even unanimity on this issue. There is a cultural significance to this, for – if I am right – Europe would be assuming cultural leadership on an important issue for the first time since the Second World War. In the past, we always followed the Americans, trailing them by five to ten years. This time, Europe is indeed ahead. That is something that I welcome. Only a few, though, are aware of what this ratification signifies. Signing it takes no time, but putting it into practice is extraordinarily difficult. Some have already referred to that. I find it all the more regrettable that, on this issue, we – we, the popularly and directly elected European Parliament – are only being consulted. This is a great economic upheaval – and we are only being consulted. That strikes me as extraordinarily regrettable, although I must say that I would still say ‘Yes’ to Kyoto if Parliament had the right of codecision, and I assume that my fellow Members would do likewise. I also call to mind the fact that we are acting on the basis of the precautionary principle, which has, in the meantime, found its way into our lawmaking. Were we not to act, our inaction could, under certain circumstances, lead to us being sued in the European Court of Justice and compelled to ratify Kyoto. This agreement also has its advantages, for we are putting our industry and ourselves under pressure to develop the most energy-efficient products and processes, and, finally, we are making ourselves competitive, even though I cannot deny that there will also be difficulties for some branches of industry.
Linkohr (PSE

Mr President, I will start by saying something about money. The EUR 17.5 billion are in my view insufficient, above all when you consider the ambitious goals that Europeans are always setting themselves. It is certainly far too little when you consider the imminent enlargement of the European Union. These funds are one day to be invested for 25 or even more Member States, and that is not enough. That, though, is how things are these days. I hope in any case that the Council will approve at least these EUR 17.5 billion, or else, and here I agree with Mr van Velzen, there will be trouble. European research policy is very much seen in terms of participation in the research programmes. I want to vigorously urge the Commission to do everything possible to make the submission of applications and their processing easier, so that the researchers can spend their time on real research rather than on filling in forms. My third observation is on fusion. We wrangle about this over and over again, and I respect the different opinions that are held on the subject. The only thing I cannot accept is that this research will not bear fruit for a very long time. We urge the young to start early on providing for old age, even though, from a young person's point of view, old age is a long, long way away. We are talking here about the same sort of provision. Whether a fusion power station is eventually built or not, is for those who come after us to decide. We should, however, give them the option. I have always considered it very important that the European Union should concern itself with highly sensitive questions that had formerly been beyond our scope, for example, new methods of detecting and removing landmines. It is fortunate that we have had a programme of this sort within the European Union for a number of years, and it has achieved noteworthy successes. My heartfelt plea is that this programme should be continued, ambitiously developed and coordinated, if possible, by a single office within the Commission. I am thinking here of the Joint Research Centre, whose achievements to date deserve to be highlighted. An attempt is similarly being made, incidentally, to involve European Union research in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological or chemical. I would remind you that the Commission will be making a statement this afternoon about the banning of biological weapons, which has to do with the fight against terrorism. In the former Soviet Union, today, there are still enormous stockpiles of biological and chemical agents that cannot be destroyed for lack of the necessary funds and often also of the necessary technology. This is an opportunity for the European Union to do something for the security of Europe and of the world. As far as bioethics is concerned, I urge support for the proposal by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which simply takes account of the different understandings of the law on this subject in the Member States, and we as European legislators cannot supplant the Member States on this point. Such a respect for sovereignty is reflected in this proposal.

Mr President, I like this report, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what he has said and, moreover, congratulate the Commission on its Green Paper, for, by it, the Commission is making us aware of our dependence on energy. I can recall no debate in the past twenty years which has pointed out our dependence on imported energy in the way this Green Paper has. Thank you again. I would like to make two observations on nuclear energy. Unlike many in my group, I take the view that it has a future. I believe that we should also express that in a positive way. Secondly, and this is perhaps even more important than the first point, I would like to observe that we have been given the task of developing a clean coal-fired power station. I say this also with reference to our obligations as a result of Kyoto. A clean coal-fired power station is not only of interest to Europe, but also to the world. For let us not forget, as the Commission repeatedly emphasised, that in the next one or two generations, our dependence on fossil energy, at any rate worldwide, will be up to 80% and it is all the more important to master combustion technologies.

Mr President, I too voted in favour of the Langen report in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and believe I was right to do so. On the other hand, I also understand how our colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy put a different emphasis on things. That, too, I consider understandable, for otherwise we would not need both committees and could do everything in one. I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day. I will be quite frank in saying that I have a number of difficulties with the Schörling report. The main one is perhaps that I believe substances should be evaluated not only according to the danger they may present, but also according to their characteristics. In this sense, they are not simply capable of being substituted for each other, at least not all of them. There are substances that are dangerous, but which are useful in certain chemical processes. Secondly, I believe that whether or not a substance is dangerous has to be founded on scientific statements. It must be verifiable. I am always very dubious about suspicions of danger or risk. Being very subjective, these can be understood but not verified. The vast number of testers required leads me to ask where they all are. Safety does not increase in line with the amount of hyphenation or the number of regulations, but is increased by actual testing. So we will have to look into that. And one more little observation: which substances are actually necessary to society? How does one ascertain something like that? Who ascertains something like that? I still need some clarification on that point, but I am happy to listen. I would, by the way, like to remind the President that, this evening, we are discussing over EUR 800 billion in turnover, 400 billion of it in energy and 400 billion in chemistry. That is a hell of a lot for two and a half hours. (Applause)

 Mr President, there is no doubt that nuclear power installations are not wholly safe from terrorist attacks. No reactor could withstand the impact of a Boeing 747. It would simply be wrong to assert anything else. What is true of nuclear installations, though, is also true of other technological systems. Mr Vitorino rightly pointed out that even a dam can be destroyed, and the Second World War shows that the consequences can be devastating. An attack on a gasometer, such as can be found in the heart of our towns, could be positively appalling. I might mention that some pressurised gasometers already operate at a lower pressure for safety reasons. If methane were to escape from a high-pressure holder – a heavy machine-gun would suffice to bring that about – and spread over the town, then once it mixed to a certain degree with the surrounding air, the town would simply burn to the ground. Accidents of this sort have occurred in the past; thank God we have managed to avoid them in the past ten years. The same applies to the water supply. It is relatively straightforward to poison water. We can all imagine how immense the consequences of that would be. Now, I accept that many in our countries are opposed to nuclear energy, and that, in some countries, they may well be in the majority. Although it is not an opinion that I share, it is one that I respect. This argument, based on the risk of terrorist attacks, could lead us to get rid of the gas industry or stop drinking water, and I find that absurd. My conclusion simply follows the line taken by the Commission. I admit it is not likely to make very good press copy, but it does have the advantage of being sensible. We should identify the dangerous sites and improve the protection of targets. Perhaps we should also take other security measures, but these must be implemented without delay. Studies are something we do not need. Mr President, please allow me a final word. We should not give the impression of total security. That can be had only at the price of total surveillance, which cannot be reconciled with a free state under the rule of law.

 Mr President, as rapporteur I cannot but agree with that. Not being myself a lawyer either, I would be interested to know what the Commission's position would be in the event of Nice not being ratified before the Treaty expires, for then, or so my reasonable human understanding tells me, a legal vacuum results, and that is something we should have looked into. In that respect I would like to support Mrs Ahern in what she has said. Having already, however, been called to speak, I wanted to point out to you that Amendments Nos 1 to 5 are founded on a misunderstanding. We did not vote on them at all in committee. They may well be substantially included in the Turchi report – there is no need for anybody to worry about that – but I recommend that we should not vote on them today, and, insofar as I am entitled to demand such a thing, I demand that.

 In this instance, I ask for a vote on the legislative resolution, in particular because of items 8 and 9, on which we have just voted. In my judgment, it is sufficient if we proceed to examine the Turchi report, but because of items 8 and 9, I would really attach importance to us now actually voting on the resolution. I ask you to vote in favour of it.
Linkohr (PSE

rapporteur.
 (DE) – 
Mr President, Mr Turchi deserves our agreement. What the Council is offering us is a bit rich. In Nice, fundamental democratic values were invoked, and in the same breath the ECSC Treaty is annulled and a research fund established, without the possibility of Parliament having any part in deciding the matter. I must say, they really have a nerve! Back to the matter in hand. We are, in fact, funeral orators here, for we are burying a treaty which, almost fifty years ago, was the prelude to the European Union, but whose death is a remarkable one. It is a death and a rebirth together, for other treaties arose from this one, and at the end of the day, the European Union is based on what it had in mind. In this context, I would like to point out that Robert Schuman at the Paris Conference in 1950 – held on 9 May, which is of course our Europe Day – observed that this was the first stage of European federation. He did not speak in terms of a coalition of nation states but of a European Federation, showing himself to be much more far-sighted than many of our statesmen and stateswomen and, indeed, than those among us who cannot yet bring themselves to utter the word 'federation'. I am just pointing this out; I assume that it will be mentioned in the history books. Secondly, this treaty is now to give birth to a research fund. Mr Turchi has pointed out that the money is not simply being returned to the Member States, but is being invested in a fund which is in future to finance research into coal and steel. This is sensible, but it does create problems. One is that Parliament has no control over this fund. I mentioned this contradiction at the outset. A second is that it creates difficulties for the research framework programme. What demarcation is there between the research framework programme, which we decide on democratically, and the Research Fund? Thirdly, what is to happen to the acceding countries? Every one of them wanting to belong to the Research Fund must in fact make an initial contribution to it in order to take any part in it. Even that creates more than one class of research in the European Union. What I suggest – something which has been taken on board by the Research Committee – is that we should resolve this conflict, and, moreover, in a positive way by, in the course of the next few years, creating from this Research Fund a Research Foundation which would develop alongside the research framework programme. Funds could be paid into it by Member States, but also from private sources – it is above all the private sources I am thinking of – in order to finance research projects other than into coal and steel. In the meantime, we are fortunate in having many affluent people who do not know what to do with their money when they reach a certain age, and who make donations. Trust funds come into being, and this Foundation can be built up by donations of this sort and so be able to concern itself with subject areas far more wide-ranging than coal and steel. I hope that Parliament will agree to this recommendation. The consequence would be that the Commission would reconsider and would perhaps present a report on how this could be translated into action. We have some experience of this in Germany. Parallel with State support for research, we have a research foundation which has functioned well ever since the 1920s and uses a minimum of bureaucracy in putting wind in the sails of German research. It would be no bad idea to do that on a European scale. Let me finally observe that proposals 1 to 5 in my report are founded on an error. I recommend that we should not vote on them. They are in any case covered by their inclusion in the Turchi report and in the amendments. I therefore recommend that there should be no vote on them. I might add that they were not voted on in committee either. This really is a mistake. Apart from that, I hope that this research fund really will give rise, in the next five to ten years, to a second support for research in the European Union. We would thereby be making good this undemocratic error which is, in this day and age, really intolerable.

Mr President, I too say bravo, Commissioner. Well done. For the rest, it never fails to astound me just how united Europeans are on the question of climate change and the measures needed to counter it. I think that climate policy is a policy people can identify with in Europe and we should turn this to our advantage. I also think that it is our duty to work on the American public, so that they follow our lead. Perhaps, in this case, we are one step ahead of the Americans, just as public opinion on other questions is often one step ahead of Europe. I should like to comment on one point of view: the impact of this climate policy on energy policy. The whole point of climate policy is that it requires us to put a price on CO2 in the future. Let us suppose that your estimates are right and that CO2 costs about EUR 30 a tonne. That means that electricity from brown coal will rise by about 3.5 eurocents and electricity from hard coal will rise by about 3 eurocents. The price of renewable sources of energy will not rise, i.e. they will become more competitive. But nor will the price of nuclear energy rise. As is it not excluded from emission trading and is only banned where there is joint implementation, this works to the advantage of nuclear energy. This completely changes the weightings within the energy spectrum. That is not the subject of this evening’s debate, but it will be subject of debates over coming months and years. I just wanted to point that out. For the rest, I share the view of many of my fellow members who said that this is a process. We have only just begun it and we must stick with it. The very fact of having been there is, I think a very good thing.
Linkohr (PSE

Mr President, the applause from all groups for Ms Jackson’s speech shows that in Europe, there is consensus on climate policy. There is obviously some sort of consensus in public opinion in the USA as well, but public opinion in the USA is different from Europe’s. This is why I believe we should not only be talking to one or two parliamentarians or government representatives; the Europeans should actually be thinking how they can influence public opinion in the USA, and indeed in Japan, if the Japanese decide not to go ahead. The task of managing climate change is so enormous that going it alone will be extremely difficult. That is precisely the issue which arises here. Even if the others do not go ahead, are we prepared to continue the course agreed at Gothenburg, which I support? Making a verbal commitment is easy. Agreeing to take on these burdens is simple and costs nothing. However, translating this into reality will be an immensely difficult task. My fear – I admit this quite openly – is that the Europeans, or many Europeans, will hide behind the US. In truth, we are a long way off meeting the standards set in the Kyoto Protocol. We all know that. The Commission feeds us a never-ending stream of fresh statistics. We face a Herculean task – I just want to make this clear. Despite these difficulties, however, let me say that for the first time since the Second World War, Europe now has the opportunity to take on political leadership at world level. We should grasp this opportunity with both hands, well aware that this is not a simple task. Incidentally, it is a noble task, not a dirty job, which Europe should address, and if others do not join us until later, we should accept this with good grace. My third comment relates to the text itself. I cannot stop myself from saying this: I must point out that what we are demanding, namely "halting" climate change, is sheer nonsense, of course. I have no idea how this slipped into the text. There has always been climate change, but this time, we are making our own contribution to it, and that is exactly what this is all about.

Mr President, if we had held this debate on the oil supply of the European Union six months ago, far more attention would probably have been paid to it and a host of journalists would have been here so that they could report on it the following day. I doubt if this will be the case today because things have calmed down somewhat since. Surprisingly, back then, when oil prices were indeed rising, albeit not so dramatically, the streets were full of protesters and if a country had held elections, the government would probably have had terrible trouble getting re-elected; even though there is nothing they can do about it, psychologically it makes a huge difference. People were confused and many took to the streets in anger. What exactly is my point here? My point is that oil policy can have an extraordinary effect on public opinion in our countries and we must be take care when talking about oil. Obviously, people are getting used to higher prices. The price of oil has since risen to 30 dollars a barrel, yet there is no revolt – at one time, even that rise would have constituted a danger. What I am trying to say here is that this is not an insignificant issue and we should make an effort to help stabilise prices – knowing full well that prices will, of course, tend to go up before they go down over the next few years, due to the shortage of oil and for ecological reasons, and that abrupt changes are dangerous. The Commission published a communication back then, on which I should now like to congratulate it. I think it is an exceptionally helpful and intelligent communication and I think the most important message – and it is this message which I also want to get across in my report – is that we need proper relations with OPEC. We need dialogue with OPEC and, more importantly, we need the European Union to speak with one voice in this dialogue. Not with fifteen, with one. I am pleased to pay you the compliment, Commissioner, but I would have said it anyway: it must be the Commissioner who speaks for the European Union. I can imagine that the band which OPEC is aiming for will be pegged at between about 22 and 28 dollars a barrel. Even 30 dollars would not be a catastrophe, even if, because of inflation, we would, of course, be more comfortable with 25 rather than 30 dollars. So where are the bones of contention, including here in Parliament? First, there is the question of tax harmonisation, of the harmonisation of duty on mineral oils. I am an ardent advocate of this sort of harmonisation, although I know that many of my fellow members take a different tack, believing that tax policy should be subject to competition. However, I think it is absolutely essential and fair, in the interests of truck drivers and haulage companies in competition with each other, that we harmonise competitive conditions. The second divisive issue that is causing problems is the use of stocks. Now I too know that these stocks, which we have estimated at 90 days, are, of course, minute compared with the size of the oil fields underground and that releasing these stocks will have little impact on the cost of energy. I am not so naive as to have overlooked this. However, I believe that it makes sense, psychologically, to release them in a crisis, but I admit that we could argue the point. The third point we need to discuss – and I am being very cautious here – is the use of fiscal instruments in the event of a crisis. If you object that this is highly adventurous, then I would remind you that the French government granted tax relief back then, contrary to European directives, and has kept it in place to this day. In other words, we have to deal with a real situation here, which we cannot allow to put us under pressure. What gives me food for thought is that OPEC stands together with the USA on climate policy. In other words, they are a partner in the US alliance, which could be dangerous when it comes to climate policy. I really would like to be able to discuss climate policy with OPEC. I think that we could well broker a compromise here. (Applause)

Madam President, I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on this proposal. If I understand you correctly, however, this Sixth Framework Research Programme contains far fewer specific programmes than the fifth and I should like to ask you why? What are the reasons? We therefore have fewer specific programmes for the sectoral themes. Up until now, we had one for biotechnology, one for energy, one for the environment, and so on. In future that is all going to be under one roof. Are you not afraid this will make the framework research programme less visible? Is there not also a danger that the lobbies representing various professional groups and sectors will be less involved in the Sixth Framework Programme because they are not clear what area it falls under? My question is: Can you give us the reasons why you have fewer specific programmes this time than last?

Mr President, I am sure the Spanish project is a highly emotive issue in Spain and I can understand that. But it is first and foremost, of course, something that must be decided in Spain itself. Taking a longer view, however, I have to say that the south’s water supply is our concern too. A question as important as this cannot be left to the Spanish alone. I can quite imagine that in 10 or 20 years’ time we shall have to be dealing with very different projects about which we dare not even think today. But there is something else I should like to mention briefly, that is the growing willingness to privatise the water industry. People are thinking about it, and I expect the Commission is too. The Ministry of Economy in Berlin has now made a study of the pros and cons of these issues. Personally, I would be very reluctant to privatise water. I know that Great Britain already has experience of this, but it is at least a subject we should approach very cautiously. It would raise problems with far-reaching constitutional consequences for our Member States. To give just one small example, in Germany we have around 4 000 municipal water companies, in France 2 or 3 large companies. When we go for privatisation, this means that the small undertakings are simply bought up. That cannot be what such liberalisation is all about. It is something we surely do not want. I do not want to go into any more detail now, I have no time to do so, but I believe it is a subject we shall have to deal with more closely in the months or years ahead.

) Mr President, Mr Purvis has done a good job as several speakers have already said. I think it is a good report. Imagine if we could understand how algae produce oxygen from sunlight. Such things exist. We could imitate it. It would transform our energy industry completely. To understand that, for example, is an enormous challenge. Or look at a sea urchin’s spine under the microscope. You get a fantastic picture of how new materials might be built. To understand how that is made could dramatically change our industrial culture. We will only understand it if we are curious enough to find out, if we approach new technology, new science with curiosity and not with fear. That is John Purvis’ message and I would like to endorse it. Moreover, as regards developing countries I would like to point out that there is one developing country that has made enormous strides in biotechnology. That is Cuba. For 40 years, Cuba has been investing in biotechnology like hardly any other country and today has a turnover in modern biotechnology of well over USD 100 million. I only want to mention that because other countries are named here. Despite all the criticism that can be levelled at Cuba in other respects, I think that is a major achievement. In the energy industry we have tended to go the way of conventional thermodynamics. No living creature operates according to conventional thermodynamics, otherwise we would not live as long as we do. Irreversible thermodynamics, small changes, will perhaps show us a completely new way forward in energy. That is also something we need to understand. Then what we have been doing hitherto will perhaps one day be seen as an aberration. I think we should be showing a little more courage with this technology, paying attention to the risks of course, but there has never been any progress made without curiosity or courage, and the same applies for biotechnology.

Mr President, the Commission has given us a good basis for discussion. However, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for substantially improving and enriching the original ideas. The ideas themselves, in fact, are not new. We have been talking about them for the last ten or fifteen years. There have been reports and studies – we already know everything we really want to know. The question is how we can implement it all. How can the technology, which is already available, be combined with the money, which is also available? And here I wonder whether the European Investment Bank could play a bigger part. The second problem I should like to address concerns administrative matters. Let me cite one small example in the federal State from which I come. Our State has a number of universities, but let us just take one of them as an example. Some of the university buildings were to be better insulated and have better energy systems installed. It took many years before the buildings were refurbished. Why? Because the buildings belonged to the Ministry of Finance, but the Ministry of Science was their user. In other words, one ministry would have had to invest, but another would have benefited from the investment. Because each of them has its own separate accounting system, they did not sit down together. It took many years until they were able to agree – and it took an EU study to bring them together, incidentally. Absurd it may seem, but that is how things are! By the way, in my home town, cars with extremely high petrol consumption are going for a song at the moment, whereas dealers are finding it difficult to sell cars with low fuel consumption. This is a third problem, a question of consumer behaviour. Consumers bear responsibility too, not only legislators. If administrators, consumers and legislators get their act together, we can achieve something, and I eagerly await the Commission’s proposals. I can assure you, Commissioner, that we shall support you in these efforts, and we shall also present initiatives of our own to that end.

 Mr President, the two rapporteurs have already mentioned the essential points. Many thanks to both of them for their detailed explanation, first here in the House and secondly in their reports. The association agreements with Chile and also of course with Mercosur are valued highly by the European Union. Therefore we support the Commission in its negotiations and also regret of course that the European Parliament is not yet formally involved in the definition of negotiating mandates. Turning to the matter in hand itself, and I speak now on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we feel that the free trade area which we wish to establish with both Chile and Mercosur must conform to WTO rules. Secondly, we do not want to damage the regional economic and trade relations between Chile and her neighbouring countries but rather to encourage these relations. This is a matter of urgency, a point also emphasised by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra. We do not want to wait until the round of WTO negotiations has been concluded. Let me remind you as well that the new Bush administration in America has already announced its intention to make the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) a main focus of its external relations. The question then immediately arises: Do we want to leave Latin America to the United States, in a kind of division of tasks, whereby the United States takes care of Latin America and Europe takes care of Eastern Europe, or do we want some kind of presence in Latin America? I feel that it would be neither in our interest nor in the interest of Latin Americans if the world were divided into two in this way. When all is said and done, I believe that there should be a regulation which promotes the integration of the South American continent and also takes account of the historic links between Europe and Latin America. I would also like to say, as regards our policy on Latin America in general, that I urge the Commission, the Council and also us here in Parliament, to give Latin America a higher profile in our external relations and in our debates. Unfortunately, and I must once again mention this here, we no longer have at our disposal as important an instrument as Irela, the Institute for European and Latin American relations, which provided great assistance in the past, even occasionally when dealing with more delicate matters. This is now regrettably as dead as a doornail. I would incidentally like to give an example of just how important this institute was in Latin America. Only recently, a member of the Irela supervisory board, Celso Lafer, was appointed Brazil’s foreign minister. This then shows what a high profile we gave previously to our relations with Latin America. In this respect, I would ask the Commission, together with Parliament, to look for a solution to enable a sensible replacement regulation to be found and to enable us to have at our disposal an instrument that can give these historic and important relations with Latin America the profile they deserve.

Mr President, I believe the report is a sound one, and I congratulate the rapporteur. I also find the term ‘research area’ very effective. I believe this is a good initiative from the Commission. I should like to say a word or two on Mr Alyssandrakis’ remarks, which invite the comment that, if Greece spent more money on research, it would be less dependent on Brussels. (Applause)
 That is the problem for many countries in the European Union. They have cut back on their research funding for both large and small projects. European research cannot fill this gap. If we want to have a European Research Area, the EU and the Member States must both play their part, otherwise we shall be faced with an imbalance that we cannot redress. I also see the administration of these research projects as a major challenge, especially when we enlarge the European Union. Brussels will not be able to go on administering them in the long run. That is why we should try, perhaps with the budgetary control apparatus, with the Court of Auditors, to develop procedures that will lighten the administrative burden in this domain. Besides, the research effort cannot be governed by the principles of prudent accounting. Research means taking risks, and some of these risks will inevitably be financial. The crux of all research activity is the final outcome. The bottom line is the result of the research and not necessarily the financial balance. I should far rather have a successful project on which some losses might have been sustained than a project with a perfect balance sheet but no useful findings. (Applause)

Mr President, it has already been said that our group will approve the Council proposal. Mexico is an important country. It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Accordingly, this agreement is of great political importance. But I would like to stress that it is also of great importance to us to approve this agreement, because it is evidence of the common foreign policy of the European Union. I address this remark in particular to the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy. In this, I differ from my British colleagues for whom it would be preferable that the Member States concluded individual agreements with Mexico. I regard the fact that the European Union is tackling this issue as a united front as a great step forward. For us, the agreement with Mexico has a high priority. What is more, it is the first in a series of agreements we are currently negotiating with Mercosur and Chile. Implementing the Mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function. As far as our foreign trade policy is concerned, this will improve our trading situation in Mexico. The share of Europe’s trade with Mexico has fallen back to simply ridiculously low levels. This situation must improve and I believe it is also in the interest of Mexico not to be solely dependent on trade with the USA but to have a well-balanced trade position, with Europe playing a role. This, I believe, is a truism. To this extent, the agreement is in our interest as much as it is in the interest of Mexico. While approving the EU/Mexico agreement, we should nevertheless honour the fact that Mexico is changing. The election of President Fox means that, for the first time since the Mexican revolution, there has been a changeover of power. Mexico now ranks among the states in which democratic changeovers of power will become the norm. There is also hope that the conflict in Chiapas, in the south of the country, will be settled peacefully. Mexico has opened itself up to the USA, but it is also prepared to open itself up to Europe. I would therefore very much welcome it if, for instance, the newly elected President of Mexico were to pay a visit to Europe in the not too distant future, and perhaps speak to us here in this Chamber, and if European heads of state were to visit Mexico. A final word on the Lucas report: as is always the case, it is clear that we do not agree on the explanatory statement contained in the report. Here, the rapporteur is free to express his or her opinion. But I would like to say in this connection that cooperation with Mexico, a country with which we entertain friendly relations, is critical. What is more, this works in both directions. We want to have the freedom to say what we do not like in other areas and we also ask our friends to tell us what they do not like. That can best be exemplified by the situation with the USA: we have had some very serious clashes with the USA – and vice versa too, I might add – without that having changed our cooperation partnership and our mutual trust in any way.

 (DE) Madam President, first of all, I should like to say to the Commission that it has done its job well. It is my wish that the European Union will continue to speak with one voice at the forthcoming international gatherings, and I consider it utterly futile to spend our time now apportioning blame to individual ministers. That will get us nowhere. We know that the failure of this conference is not the end of what has been a very lengthy and highly complex process; the process will continue. However, we must ask ourselves where improvements can be made. The first point, which I also frame as a question to the Commission, is whether this method we have chosen here, with conferences at which representatives of 180 nations have to agree on a joint document, does not ask too much of us, especially when time is pressing towards the end and the differences between the main parties have not yet been settled. Is it not time that this issue was dealt with by the U.S. and European Heads of State and Government at the G7 summits? Secondly, this does not mean that I aim to give us such an easy time. When we point the finger at the Americans, we must not forget that a number of fingers are pointed back at us. It is not as if we Europeans had all done our homework. CO2 emissions are on the increase here too; we know that, and we have discussed it often enough. The question is whether we actually need a global convention before we can start to reduce our own emissions. May I remind the Commission of its communication on emissions trading and on the conference in The Hague, in which it spoke of being able, in certain circumstances, to present a draft directive in which the quotas agreed by the environment ministers in 1998 would be prescribed and in which sanctions would be laid down for quota violations. My question is this: are you willing to do that, to present such an instrument, even though we have not completed the Kyoto process? Is there actually anything to stop us introducing emissions trading in the European Union in the year 2005, now that a number of countries have already made a start on emissions trading within their national borders? My final comment is that I find it right and proper that you have remained firm on the issue of “sinks”, primarily because it is extremely difficult to measure “sinks” accurately. We were supposed to bring home measurable results, by which I mean physically measurable results, but that aim has not been compatible with the Americans' position.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy also sees emissions trading as a reasonable solution. However, we also believe that it should only apply to 50% of the total reduction in emissions. The key point about emissions trading is that in future not only electricity and gas will have a price, but also CO2. That sounds very simple, but it means a total revolution in the energy business, in the energy sector. We need to be aware of that. It will have enormous consequences and I am convinced that it can also help to reduce emissions. What is the likely scenario for the next few years? I hope that following successful completion of the negotiations in The Hague, the European Union will ratify the Kyoto Protocol. That means that we will be legally committing ourselves. The next thing required is for the Commission to bring forward a directive sharing the burden among the 15 Member States. So we need quotas. But these quotas must be linked with sanctions, otherwise they will be meaningless. In other words we will then have a common energy policy via environment policy, which would be a very circuitous route. We could then start emissions trading within the European Union in 2005. Once more, I hope that we will be able to adhere to this scenario, more or less, and that we will not let ourselves be put off by the fact that others, perhaps even the United States, will not have signed it for the time being. We should support the Commission here and present a united front as far as possible.

Mr President, I would prefer it if, for once, we could have a debate on Latin America following well-prepared discussions in the committees, rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other. It seems to me that we only ever deal with events in Latin America on a case by case basis, but otherwise pursue a very reticent policy. It is a shame, because the continent merits more attention. As far as Peru is concerned, a number of speakers, and also our resolution, have pointed to the fact that President Fujimori’s forthcoming resignation offers scope for a fresh start. I am not so sure whether this will be the case though, because there have already been one or two disturbing developments on this front, and I will only be convinced once Fujimori has actually stepped down or been voted out of office. I therefore think it is extremely important for the European Union to get fully involved with this country, and with the situation in Peru, for example by maintaining an orderly dialogue with the forces of opposition. I would like us to send the delegation that we wanted to send to the elections – which then failed to take place for reasons we are all familiar with – to Peru now, with a view to supporting those who are working towards democratic reform in the country. And if that were to be the outcome of this afternoon’s sitting, I would be more than satisfied.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in your communication on the European research area you also referred to the poor mobility of researchers and to the problems within Europe.

 Mr President, I shall also be voting for this resolution, which I consider to be reasonable. If it can help to defuse the battle of words between the two sides somewhat, than it will certainly have served its purpose. I regret that the Czech Republic is unable to defend itself here and present its case, as it is always good to hear both sides of such a complicated argument. However, in the same spirit of openness I would also like to say that I do not think it is right for the Austrian Government and Parliament to be delivering a kind of ultimatum here. That is not the way we have handled these things in the European Union up to now. It is quite evident that there is a problem, but if we start issuing ultimatums then the next thing will be that a delegation will arrive representing displaced persons and demand that the Czech Republic can only join the Union if the Benesch Decrees are withdrawn. And then some other group will come along demanding something else. You have to be careful with ultimatums like this. There are other ways of solving such problems. But I would also like to suggest to the Czech Republic that they should pay serious attention to the concerns expressed by the German Association for Nuclear Safety. That was another point I wanted to make. My last, but important point, is one for the Commission. We hear a lot about environmental impact, and that is fine. But we also have the Euratom Treaty. Article 37 of that Treaty effectively stipulates that the Commission must be kept informed about any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in any form whatsoever. The Commission also has to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. I know that the Czech Republic does not yet belong to the European Union. Nevertheless, I would be interested to know what the Commission's view is in relation to this article, and whether it considers that the Czech Republic has respected it. It would be interesting, as Gordon Adam has already asked, to know what its view is on the environmental impact assessment.

Mr President, it is a pity that none of the British delegates who support the government’s stance have taken the floor. It would have been interesting to hear their arguments too, because I am quite sure that they must have had a few thoughts on the matter . In Great Britain, it has been permissible, since 1990, to experiment on embryos up to fourteen days old. I believe this is the next logical step. Why does Great Britain behave differently to the continent? That is certainly an interesting question. The difference obviously does not depend on which government is in power. It was a Conservative Government before, and now they have a Labour Government, and yet nothing has changed. Why is public opinion in Great Britain unlike that on the other side of the Channel? It would be entirely appropriate to discuss this kind of issue during this debate, because we have the privilege of being in the company of delegates from the four corners of the European Union. That was the first comment I wanted to make. Secondly, I wanted to say how impressed I was with Mrs Bonino’s comments. It really struck a chord with me. I too would advocate that we should allow ourselves to be guided by the laity in matters of principle. The State is not religious, but it has a duty to respect religion. I too have respect for whether someone is Catholic, Evangelical, Jewish or whatever. But I also want my opinion to be respected. However this is only possible within a lay context. Claims of infallibility have already done Europe untold damage. We should endeavour to leave this behind. No one has a monopoly on ethics. People who see things differently are ethical too. Incidentally, we have seen time and again how bans are watered down in practice. Everyone could cite examples of this. That is why I am firmly convinced – whatever we decide here – that in a cosmopolitan society performing research from a variety of perspectives, knowledge will out. At the end of the day, we will have no choice but to deal with this knowledge in a responsible manner by trying to circumscribe it. Mr Wurtz, a ban on any type of research may be called for, but it would be extraordinarily naïve to believe that this ban would be observed. In the final reckoning, we will have no choice but to lay down boundaries. I feel as many other people do about this issue. The thought of embryos being meddled with and experimented on makes my hair stand on end. There are certainly boundaries. But practical experience has shown me that at the end of the day, it will probably not be possible to do a great deal more than simply circumscribe everything. There is no need for us to take action at present. We still have time. We need to think very carefully about how we are going to proceed in this matter. We have committees for this purpose, and sometimes reading a good book has its uses.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have two things to say. The first is that I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports, which were well worth reading. Secondly, I should like to say directly to the Commission: stick to your guns, stick to your guns with the Council! Because the real problem is that the Council, that the Member States, are forever wanting to have their say on a matter which the Treaty says is your responsibility. Just imagine that the Americans had implemented their aid under the Marshall Plan after the war in such a way that for each sub-programme they had asked the Member States of the USA whether they, for example, ought to fund a reforestation project in the south-western part of Bavaria or not! It would probably have taken until the end of the last century to disburse the Marshall Plan aid. This is not what I want to happen to you. Mr Patten, stick to your guns! Parliament ought to support you on this. The Council or the Member States have a right to be consulted, but they do not have a right to co-decision. I suspect that this will also be the decisive issue for the Commission when history judges it one day. You will be judged on enlargement towards the east, but also on whether you create your own room for manoeuvre in external policy. Now we are not demanding a voice for the Commission alongside the United Kingdom or France on nuclear capabilities for example. But where the budget is concerned, the European Union's own budget, you are the executive. We should secure this position and defend it! In Parliament you should have an ally here!

 Mr President, I still remember the 1980s very well, when Latin America, including Paraguay of course, attracted enormous attention in Europe, because at that time a great many people, and above all young people, were interested in restoring democracy to Latin America. Fortunately, by the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s nearly every Latin American state had returned to democracy. But in several countries there are signs of a return to the old ways. Paraguay is one of the worst examples of this. It therefore makes sense that the European Parliament, which has always regarded itself as the patron saint of democracy in Latin America and elsewhere, should express its views on this. The second point that I would like to mention relates to Paraguay and Brazil. Mr Lipietz has already touched upon this, but with a somewhat different emphasis. I regard it as being extraordinarily helpful that within Mercosur, to which both these countries belong, a code of values has now been adopted under which dictators, or attempts to establish a dictatorship, no longer have a chance of success. Oviedo was arrested in Brazil and I hope that he will be extradited to Paraguay. This is proof that Mercosur is more than just a free trade area – it is a political area in which democracy is protected. By the way, I totally agree with Mr Lipietz when he says that what is at stake in Paraguay is not just General Oviedo, but human rights as a whole. There is nothing separating us on that. However, you cannot of course write a whole book in a short resolution. I hope that we will be able to discus this issue at some other point, and I assume that we will also be able to reach a consensus then.

 Mr President, I shall be brief, because almost everything has been said already, while I was waiting my turn. The situation in Peru, like the situation in Paraguay, gives cause for concern. Nevertheless, I must say that what we have witnessed in Peru is nothing new. The President of Peru has for years been failing to play by the rules that we expect in a democracy. So I would not just send a delegation of observers to Peru, but I would also recommend that the European Union, the Council and also this Parliament should pay more attention to the whole region. We need more than just a resolution every now and again, we need to be constantly alert and critical, so that the people who are working for democracy are aware of our support. Furthermore, I would like to point out that is not just the OAS, important as it is for Latin America, that has supported democracy in Latin America. The European Union and this Parliament have in fact also played a key role here. We have spent a great deal of money in this region and it would be gratifying if now and again people talked about the European Union’s contribution in Latin America, and not just about North America’s role. This is not intended to be a chauvinistic remark, I am just making it so that justice is done towards us. I hope that the European Parliament’s views on Peru will not go unheard in that country. I know that a great many people set a lot of store by what this Parliament says. Lastly, I would also like to mention that the longest standing relationship between the European Parliament and another parliament is with the Latin American Parliament – to which Peru also belongs – and that involves certain obligations. I accordingly hope that we will obtain a large majority in favour of this resolution.

Mr President, I should like to follow on from Mr Liese’s closing comment on climate change, to which Mr Marset Campos also referred. It is perhaps not by chance that we have suffered tremendous devastation in Central America, Venezuela and Mozambique, not to mention in Europe, and it is likely to increase. It seems reasonable to suppose that it is not increasing by chance and that it really is the result of man-made climatic changes. I would therefore like to see a link established between how we view these disasters and energy policy. There really is a link and I should like to draw your attention to it. I only wish there were not. The second point I would like to make is that aid should be used to integrate Central America. This has been a perennial cause for concern to the European Parliament and we have called for it on many occasions. In the final analysis, of course, this is up to the people of Central America. But perhaps the shock triggered by Hurricane Mitch gives us an excuse to overcome the hostilities and difficulties between the individual countries. In any case, the people would be grateful and, for the rest, our aid would be worthless without any progress with integration. The third point I should like to make concerns the implementation of this aid. I do not envy the Commission this task because I know full well that, in a few years’ time, a report on the alleged or rightly criticised misuse of funds will land in our lap and I should like to point out that the cost of controlling these funds often exceeds the gain. I hope that we shall be giving the Commission a certain amount of room for manoeuvre 
in the use of these funds because the speed at which programmes are implemented is often much more important than accounts in black and white down to the last penny. I know that this is a comment which a parliamentarian should not make nowadays, but I make it nonetheless because I am right. Finally, I should like to point out that the hurricane in October 1998 went beyond Central America. It is now June 2000. In other words, we too are an unwieldy apparatus and perhaps we too need to consider how we can speed up the process. Even if we pass a resolution today, we are still a long way from building up the country; on the contrary, it will take many years, perhaps a generation. I consider that to be far too long.

Mr President, unfortunately Mr Murphy cannot be here with us this evening and I therefore have the honour of representing him here today. However, I am at a disadvantage. I was not involved in the work of the conciliation committee, although I have studied the documents. So please forgive me if I am not quite as well informed as the members who helped in the conciliation procedure. I should like to thank those members because, even as someone who was not involved, I can say that this is an important directive. It is important to SMEs, it is important to the public sector, it is probably a far more important instrument for promoting employment than many of the resolutions passed here in this House. I can still remember the earlier debates: late payments are a breach of contract and this directive stipulates that the purchaser must pay the vendor the full sum owed within 30 days of receipt of the goods. Otherwise, he must pay a penalty in the form of interest etc. Discussions with the Council gave rise to a whole series of problems which we have now managed to settle, several sittings later. One of the main problems was the question of retention of title, whereby the vendor retains ownership of the goods pending full payment. It was also agreed that freedom of contract cannot be invoked in order to limit the effects of the so-called anti-abuse clause. We have agreed on a clear regulation here which ensures that the debtor cannot procure additional liquidity or additional advantages at the creditor’s expense. In addition – and this was an important point – the principle of equal treatment between the public and private sectors has been acknowledged. As far as interest is concerned, we have compromised between the 6% proposed by Council and the 8% proposed by Parliament, agreeing in the conciliation procedure on 7%. All in all, it is a reasonable result and, I repeat, it is a result which will mainly help SMEs in the Union. I personally was most surprised to read that late payments were one of the main reasons for bankruptcies in Europe. Apparently some 450,000 jobs are lost in the EU every year as a result. We often spend a great deal of money on very few jobs. Here we are achieving the desired effect cost-free, as it were, and I think that Parliament should make it clear to the outside world that it has done job security a huge service. Allow me to close with one more comment regarding the Commission. Late payments are a breach of contract even when it is the Commission which is late paying. This does not figure in the directive but, in my experience as an MEP, we often hear complaints when we visit SMEs and large companies alike, that the Commission is often far too late honouring the payment commitments which it has entered into in research promotion or other areas. I hope that the Commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive and make its own payments on time, because here too, I repeat, this is breach of contract. My warmest thanks once again to everyone involved and I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to extend my most sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, for this report, and, incidentally, to the Commission, for the document they have presented us with. In the short time available, I have just two comments to make: I would like to take up what Mr Rübig had to say about youth. People the length and breadth of the country complain that we do not have enough engineers. Young people are no longer going to university to study natural sciences. Where I come from, a survey was carried out in order to ascertain why this should be. This had surprising results. We had always believed that young people are no longer choosing to study the natural sciences or engineering at university because the job prospects are so poor. This is not the case. They do not study physics and chemistry because they are no fun. In a society that prizes having fun so highly, it is evidently extremely important for things to be fun. We are evidently failing to make the material attractive to people and suited to the lifestyles they have these days. They are from a different generation to mine. Therefore, I advocate that we bear this in mind when we find ourselves talking in such scholarly terms about the next generation.   The second proposal I would just like to make is as follows: we are discussing the European research area. We are going to enlarge the European Union, marvellous! Indeed all these States are already taking part in the fifth research framework programme at the present time, and they will also participate in the sixth. I would therefore recommend involving the Parliamentarians and Ministers for Research of these countries in the preparation for the sixth research framework programme as well. I would envisage doing this here in the European Parliament – the French expression is assises de recherche 
– so that we can have a joint discussion about the guidelines for the sixth research framework programme.

 Mr President, Mr Väyrynen’s comments just now about concentric circles remind me a little of a hole with circles drawn round it, looking at Switzerland and Europe. I hope this hole will be filled sometime in the next few years with the accession of Switzerland to the European Union. For then we would not have to negotiate and decide seven different agreements but all this would be a matter of course. I very much hope we will make progress in this regard over the next few years. But perhaps these seven agreements are a preparation for that debate and I very much hope that just as Parliament will be approving these seven agreements by a large majority tomorrow – or so I assume – the Swiss people will also approve them by a large majority on 21 May in order to make it clear that Switzerland is part of Europe. I would like to say a few words about the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation because I myself have been repeatedly involved in that area of cooperation with Switzerland over the past few years. I warmly welcome that agreement because basically it means that Switzerland will take part in the European Union’s framework research programme on an equal footing. To that end, it will pay a contribution in line with its GDP yet participate fully in the programme. That is a major advantage for both sides. Yet there is one drawback: it is the European Parliament and the Council that decide the content of this programme, not Switzerland. That means that Switzerland, like Israel, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, which also take part in this framework research programme, can only participate in something that is decided over their heads. They have no say as regards its content. So I would propose that we take our time preparing the sixth framework research programme and that we at least hold informal talks with the Swiss parliamentarians – just as we do with Israel, Norway and so on, i.e. states which do not belong to the EU but which do take part in the framework research programme. That is something the European Parliament could organise. Parliament could take the initiative and invite parliamentarians from these countries, so that we can know in advance what input the Swiss can contribute, what problems they may have, what proposals they may have. In fact, this would also be a step towards bringing Switzerland and the European Union closer together. I would very much hope we could do that. Aside from that, let me thank Mr Carraro again for this excellent report. Anyone who wants to learn will find a great deal of information in his report. Once again, many thanks and I hope we will adopt it by a large majority tomorrow.

Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr Turmes on behalf of my Group for the excellent and detailed work contained in his report. We certainly have no lack of reports. We have had the Mombaur report, the Rothe report, the former member, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, drafted a report, Mrs Ahern drafted a report and, if I remember correctly, I also drafted a report on this subject once. So there is no shortage of reports and they have all been translated into every possible language. What we need now are initiatives to implement our decisions. We have decided that the share of renewable sources of energy should rise from 6% to 12%. At present, if I remember the figures correctly, we are not yet even quite at 6%, but at 5.4%. In any case, I am merely repeating the Commission’s figures. How can we do this? Biomass and hydroelectric power account for 95% of renewable energy sources in the European Union. Wind, solar energy, photovoltaic energy etc. only account for 5%! In other words, if we decide to double these figures and if we come up against purely physical limits with hydroelectric power, if we cannot build more large power stations as and where we please, and there is a limit to what we can do in the Alps, then we have to think of something else, for example a bridge with agricultural policy. I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to build a bridge with agricultural policy, to enter into an alliance. If, for example, the enlargement of the European Union encompasses countries such as Poland, which have large agricultural areas and a high proportion of their population working in agriculture, most of whom will become unemployed over the next 10 or 20 years as these countries engage in intensive farming, then there is room for manoeuvre here. There is, of course, the question of how we can finance this, but at least we have technical room for manoeuvre. As far as renewable sources of energy and financing them at national level is concerned, I have just a few brief comments. The systems are so different that they must, at all costs, be made compatible in the medium term, so that we can create a real European market here. Secondly, aid must be degressive. Not radically degressive perhaps, otherwise there is no end result, but it must show a downward trend in order to ensure that the best technologies are used, because there is constant technical progress even with renewable sources of energy. I can easily imagine, and here I do not share Mr Mombaur’s view, that we may need to consider sanctions, otherwise the whole thing makes no sense. For example, we undertook at Kyoto to adhere to certain quotas. No one can be punished for failing to keep to the quotas. Had we introduced the euro like that, if no sanctions had been imposed for failing to comply with requirements, the euro would not have been a success. In the case of renewable sources of energy or the CO2 policy, nothing will be achieved in the long run without sanctions. We cannot enter into commitments willy-nilly and then fail to honour them. I keep coming back to this: without sanctions, this joint energy policy, because in the final analysis that is what it is, will not function. It is perhaps an unpleasant thought, but it will not function otherwise.

Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Ferrer for her excellent report. She has gone to a great deal of trouble and has used her report to set out the problems and the advantages and disadvantages of this project with Mexico. This is a trade agreement which falls within the competence of the EU and, as you rightly say, we only have the option of saying yes or no. We cannot renegotiate the agreement. All in all, our Group will vote in favour of this trade agreement, which we welcome. For the rest, I should like to say to Mr Folias, who worries about the problem of footwear that, generally-speaking, trade relations between Europe and Mexico have always proven their worth in the past. We might have been able to dispense with the Lannoye report on chocolate yesterday had Mexico not given us cocoa in the past. In fact, chocolate – "chocolatl"
 – is a Mexican word. We can therefore use past experience to help develop future relations with Mexico. The advantage to Mexico is obvious. This agreement will enable Mexico to redress the imbalance of its one-way dependence on the USA to a certain extent. I should like to remind the House that 85% of Mexico’s exports go north and only 5% come to Europe. Mexico stands to gain here by achieving a better trade equilibrium. Mexico’s automobile industry, which is partly of European origin, certainly also stands to gain from the possibility of exporting vehicles to Europe. We too stand to gain, as does European industry, be it on the Mexican market or by exporting to the USA via the Mexican market. As far as trade is concerned, there are advantages all round. I should like to go briefly into, or at least touch on, two problems. The first are social problems; in other words, Mexico will certainly have to review its social policy because trade policies alone will not solve social problems. When free trade increases, there are also losers. Poverty in Mexico has risen rather than fallen. Social policy is therefore an important area for Mexico and we should build this into the dialogue with Mexico. The second is scientific and technical cooperation. I think that there is potential here which can be exploited between Europe and Mexico.

Mr President, if you compare the damaged area of Venezuela to Germany, then it is as if our entire coastal region had been destroyed and 200 000 people had lost their lives. That illustrates the huge scale of this disaster for a country like Venezuela. I am not being macabre when I say that the best thing which could happen to Venezuela right now would be soaring oil prices, so that it could finance as much as possible itself. Unpleasant because expensive for us, to be sure, but advantageous to Venezuela. In this respect, Venezuela is in a better position after all the damage which it has suffered than central America was after hurricane Mitch. But that is poor consolation in the face of the huge devastation. The demand for an international donor conference with the active participation of the Commission therefore makes sense. For the rest I, like the other Members, am waiting for the Commission to submit a plan to us as quickly as possible as to how it can help here, in agreement with the Venezuelan government. Venezuela can count on our sympathy, but it also needs money, imagination and help to rebuild. Allow me to add that globalisation does not just mean trade, it also means solidarity. However, it is also reasonable after such a devastating catastrophe to inquire into the causes. I fear that we will have to deal with more and more natural disasters in which people are partly to blame. Of course, people are powerless in the face of a natural change of climate, but then greenhouse gases are also part of the equation. That is where the problem lies. Unfortunately, Europe is not honouring its Kyoto commitments. I hope that this disaster and, unfortunately others, will give us cause to consider and to take measures so that we do not always have to talk of catastrophes every time there is an emergency and can perhaps also discuss what preventative action can be taken to avoid disasters on this scale. If that is nature’s way, at least we should not have a part in it. (Applause)

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Chichester for his report and for his proposals. This will certainly not be the last debate on environment and energy policy that we have in this House. However this report has enabled us to make some headway.   Had we been conducting this debate 10 or 20 years ago then there would have been very different things at the forefront of our minds. We would have been discussing sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide or dust. We have achieved a number of successes in this area in the course of the last few years, I am very glad to say. Europe’s air quality has improved and a whole range of initiatives has been set in train in those areas where there is still room for improvement. The biggest problem in this respect is still posed by Eastern Europe of course, i.e. those countries wishing to join the European Union, and we ought not to disregard this problem in my view. Furthermore, we ought not to forget that some of these qualitative improvements were achieved purely on account of the fact that gas replaced coal, although just how beneficial this was is a moot point. In any case, this change and new technologies have definitely enabled us to improve the air quality and indeed this point has been made in the report as well. Mr Mombauer rightly pointed out – at least this is what I understood him to mean – that without a doubt, the internal market we have now created requires certain efforts to be made on the part of the Member States. But it also requires the European Union to come up with framework directives, that is a framework in which competition can take place under environmentally friendly conditions. That is the new task which the European Union has in store for it. And so we need there to be more, not less concerted EU action in this area.  Secondly, I would like to point out that, as far as we are able to predict, the fossil energy sources, that is coal, oil and gas, will predominate for a long time to come in Europe alone, to say nothing of the rest of the world. In other words, if we want to improve the quality of the air, if we want to tackle the greenhouse effect then we must also continue to focus heavily on combating these effects, which are caused by burning fossil fuels. Unfortunately we do not discuss this nearly enough, but it really is still the case that improved burning technologies – and energy-saving devices too, incidentally, but above all improved burning technologies – offer the best chance of success in this area. I believe that when it comes to research, there is still a great deal we can do here to increase effectiveness. The fuel cell is certain to be of benefit to us in the years to come and the same goes for the combined heat and power system. These technologies, which are highly effective, must be promoted, possibly by means of taxation if market forces alone do not do the trick. I also believe that it is very important, when it comes to energy policy, to do more in the way of galvanising individual citizens into action and making use of their powers of imagination. It is worthwhile having citizens come up with initiatives in the field of energy policy. They stimulate individuals‘ imagination and also their willingness to take risks. There is a whole host of examples of initiatives that have been pursued in villages or towns, or by individual groups, which have led to a great deal of energy being saved or to new technologies being implemented more rapidly than is usually the case. We should prize such things highly. On a final note though, I would like to mention two phenomena not directly associated with the European Union but with the world climate. Some of you may have read that in China there are such phenomena as smouldering fires. Huge quantities of coal burn and smoulder. Some of these smouldering fires occur naturally and some are started by people. They produce enormous amounts of CO2, far more than the amount we are cutting down by over here. The second phenomenon concerns the burning of what is known as associated gas, in Russia and also in the Near East. Quantities of CO2 are released in these countries that vastly exceed the amounts we have cut down by here in Europe in the course of the last few years. As such, incidentally, larger quantities of gas are being burnt than we import from Russia. I would just like to draw your attention to this phenomenon. This calls for more than just a report. What is really needed here is for policy to be developed as well, perhaps even at the highest level. I felt it was imperative that I refer to this phenomenon once again.

 Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists will also be voting for this report. We believe that international cooperation is bound to benefit from research, without denying that there are also certain risks. However, in the case of China, I would also like to point out that cooperation with this country in not a one-way process with Europeans bearing their fine gifts on a golden platter – we can also learn from the Chinese. As we are going to discuss Argentina later on, I would like to remind you of something. The compass came to us from China via the Arabs, and if we had not been given the compass, we would probably not have discovered America either. We could then forget about the report on Argentina! So European culture has learnt something from China, and I hope that will continue to apply in future. Our problem with China – which has already quite rightly been pointed out and which is not limited to this one country – is human rights. With China there is also the issue of Tibet, their threatening behaviour towards Taiwan, and so on. Nevertheless, I would like to warn again using research as a political weapon, as a means of putting pressure on a country over such issues. I do not believe that works. In any case, we end up punishing the wrong people since, in general, scientists are our allies, at least in spirit. The subjects listed here are quite reasonable – health, the environment, food and so forth. Let me remind you that we are not talking about nuclear cooperation. Nor are we planning joint development of arms, no, we are considering reasonable issues of benefit to people there and also, indirectly, to us in Europe. To conclude, perhaps I could mention an idea of my own. I can well imagine that in view of China’s great importance it would make sense to have an EU-China research institute or a facility where Chinese and Europeans could work on one or more long-term projects. So Chinese and Europeans would work together on a single site, be it in China or in Europe. An experience of this kind, learning each other’s language and understanding each other’s culture, could be extraordinarily attractive and stimulating for both sides. There is no mention of this in the project, but I simply wanted to propose it here. Perhaps we could consider this when we sign our next agreement with China.

 Mr President, fortunately we do not have the same problem with Argentina that we have with Russia or China. I am happy to say that Argentina has put its military past behind it. It is now a democracy – to be taken with a pinch of salt, perhaps, but a democracy. That is why as rapporteur I would also like to recommend that we include the democratic aspect in this scientific and technological cooperation, by which I mean that Members of Parliament from Argentina and also from the European Union should discuss research and science topics and perhaps point the way to the future. In recent years, Argentina has made efforts to increase public expenditure on research and technology, but it remains at a relatively low level. 0.5% of GDP is spent on research. That is far too little, even if, within Latin America, it is still one of the top-spending countries. But that is no way to approach the twenty-first century. Cooperation between Argentina and the European Union is therefore also a way of encouraging Argentina and other Latin American countries to increase the amount they spend on investing in future. It is no secret that Latin America’s share of world trade – and thus Argentina’s share – has fallen significantly over the last 20 years. This is associated with a lack of investment in the future. We are witnessing a flight, not only of capital, but also of people educated either in these countries or in Europe or in the USA, who have left their country and sought work elsewhere. In this respect – let me repeat this – cooperation with Europe is a form of encouragement to take the same approach as we do, that is to invest in the future. Nevertheless, the funds involved are meagre. In my report you will see a summary, provided by the Commission, which indicates that Argentina received EUR 18 million under the fourth framework programme of research. This consisted of nothing but small, yet very interesting programmes. EUR 18 million is not a lot! If you have that sort of money available, then you have to try to use it to attract larger sums. I would like to encourage the Commission to consider using these modest sums to encourage private companies to invest more in research in Argentina, and, once again, in other Latin American countries also. I have a figure in front of me which I find encouraging – and it ought to be extrapolated to the whole European Union: Germany’s chemical industry spends DM 12.3 billion a year on research and development, added to which there is DM 5 billion for research abroad, generally in the USA in practice, but also in countries in Latin America and elsewhere, and you will see that there are more and more investors in the research sector. If you extrapolate that, European industry as a whole may be investing DM 20 billion or EUR 10 billion in research activities outside the European Union, and if the funds the European Union is making available here could be used to attract private research funding also, that would be a benefit, and would mean that countries like Argentina would not be just tantamount to extensions of Europe’s workshops, but could also participate in research and development themselves. I would like to encourage the Commission to adopt that approach. The committee for which I am rapporteur will approve that. In addition, just as with China, I would like to remind you that research with these countries – with Argentina and other countries – is a two-way street. We benefit from it too. Given that this year is the two-hundredth anniversary of Alexander von Humboldt’s journey to Venezuela, I would like to recall that Alexander von Humboldt did not just take something out there – his curiosity – but he also brought something back, namely knowledge about tropical plants and about the geography of this interesting continent. On that note, I also hope that research cooperation with Argentina and other countries will benefit the people of Europe, the European Union.

 Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Laura González Álvarez and also the Spanish speaker who is coming after me. Without them, one might have assumed that this is a Northern European debate. This is not the case, as this is an issue which concerns us all. On climate change itself, I would like to express my fear that this issue is being continually pushed into the background, as something which is of less and less interest to the public and to politicians. Finally we have professed our beliefs and that appears to be enough for most people. That would be extraordinarily dangerous! Therefore, I would like to suggest two things: firstly, we should endorse Mr Lange’s call to reach agreement on the emissions trade with the close involvement of Parliament, because such a powerful intervention in trade policy would be very difficult to carry out against Parliament’s wishes. Secondly, I suggest that we establish a binding timetable, one with real sanctions against any EU State that deviates from the targets for reduction. The model I recommend is the concerted reduction of debt, which has now made the Euro possible.

 In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a brief statement for the benefit of Members. Today, we are voting on the compromise package on medicinal products legislation, a compromise influenced by a lot of different ideas from this House. I therefore ask Members to support Blocks 1, 2 and 3, but not under any circumstances Block 4 or parts thereof. If even only one amendment from Block 4 is adopted, we will have to go to conciliation, and it will not be possible to adopt the Common Position today; hence my appeal to you. The package we have put together with the Council is a good one, so please support the compromise. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate this evening concerns the revision of the body of legislation relating to medicinal products in the European Union and its impact on patients and the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, it is important to note that knowledge about the manufacture of medicinal products and the action of any given drug is not general knowledge. Due to the complex scientific interactions and manufacturing processes, very few patients in Europe will be able to evaluate the opportunities, risks and prospects of success of a treatment with any given drug. That is why we need an agency to evaluate the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products on behalf of the patient. This evaluation must meet high scientific standards, not only in the interests of patients but also in the interests of manufacturers. After all, if problems arise as a result of serious adverse reactions to a drug, the manufacturers are likely to forfeit their reputation and have to pay financial penalties, while patients have the physical effects to contend with. This means that the reform of the legislation on the authorisation of medicinal products, which is the subject of our debate today, must guarantee the safety of medicinal products but also establish general conditions which authorise and underpin research by pharmaceutical companies and thus boost their competitiveness. This not only benefits the companies concerned; it also safeguards jobs. Not least, patients benefit from the research findings and from new and effective medicinal products. With this legislation, we have, I believe, succeeded in resolving the dilemma between the need for high standards of health protection, on the one hand, and the industry’s calls for better conditions for research and competitiveness, on the other. In a global economy with different legal frameworks in Europe, Asia and the USA, and with the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, this was not an easy task. The global compromise with the Council that has now been achieved offers us the opportunity to conclude the package reforming the legislation on medicinal products in the second reading. It is a good compromise, as it generally reflects the views of this House on key issues concerning legislation, pharmacovigilance, the scope of the centralised authorisation procedure, protection and the composition of the Agency's Management Board. I believe that the compromise tailors the legislation to reflect scientific progress and economic developments, and patients will benefit from this. Let me comment briefly on the key topics. A particularly important aspect of the reform of the legislation on medicinal products is improving pharmacovigilance. This House has successfully enforced a high level of safety in the authorisation procedure as well as an effective system of surveillance and control. With the establishment of a database at the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), the Agency will in future play a key role in an effective pharmacovigilance system. This is especially important because a well-functioning pharmacovigilance system is essential for patients’ wellbeing. Although the compromise does not establish a compulsory centralised authorisation procedure for all new active substances – a proposal which was endorsed by this House at first reading – the list of indications has nonetheless been extended to include orphan drugs, with a further extension after four years to include indications for autoimmune and viral diseases. As a result, a wide range of new active substances will be subject to the centralised authorisation procedure in future. The European Medicines Agency in London will guarantee, through the structures and working methods envisaged in this legislation, that scientific resources are coordinated effectively, thus safeguarding the high standards of the evaluations. Centralised authorisation through the EMEA will ensure that all patients in Europe enjoy the same prompt availability of innovative and effective medicinal products. The provisions on data protection were another controversial topic. The protection period agreed in the current compromise, of eight years, plus two, plus one, for the centralised and the decentralised procedure, ensures, firstly, that there is an incentive to carry out research, and secondly, that the further development of proven active substances is rewarded. This uniform Europe-wide provision protects the economic interests of manufacturers engaged in research and the interests of generics manufacturers and – unlike the period originally proposed by the Commission – reduces the burden on the national health systems. The global compromise with the Council places patients’ needs at the heart of the legislation, promotes research and innovation and also safeguards the competitiveness of European industry. That is why I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the Council’s compromise. As is always the case with compromises, not all our proposals have been fulfilled. Nonetheless, I believe that we have found a solution, even on controversial points such as homeopathic medicinal products. Through the mutual recognition procedure, it is now possible for every patient in Europe to access these medicinal products. On the matters concerning the WTO, too, I believe that we have found an acceptable solution, although it is beyond the scope of this legislation to regulate these issues. The Commission has pledged to present a proposal on this topic in the new year. I therefore believe that the overall outcome is good and that the compromise is worth supporting. I do not think that initiating a conciliation process with the Council will produce a better result, especially as it will not solve the two issues that I have mentioned. Tomorrow’s vote – and I urge my fellow Members to support the compromise on that occasion – will enable us to launch sustainable legislation on medicinal products. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow rapporteur Mrs Grossetête, as well as the Secretariat, the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House and our fellow Members have contributed, through their many amendments over the last two weeks, to ensuring that we could achieve a good compromise with the Council. I believe this compromise is a gift to European citizens and not, as some Members of the House might think, to the pharmaceuticals industry. I take a different view. Those of us who have worked intensively on this package of legislation and are familiar with the details also know that the situation is different. With the EMEA, we have created efficient structures which safeguard the quality of evaluations, thus ensuring that safe medicinal products are available to patients. We have a database containing a wealth of information for patients, doctors and, indeed, for companies themselves. We have transparent authorisation procedures, and we have information about adverse reactions, to cite just a few examples of what we have achieved for patients. We have a centralised authorisation procedure which covers a wide range of indications. As a result, a great many new and innovative medicinal products are subject to the centralised procedure and can be made available at an early stage to patients. We have asked the Commission to compile information and guidelines to ensure that the information supplied to patients is genuinely independent. All these are things which directly benefit patients. In five years’ time, we will have a new authorisation procedure, which will include a cost-benefit analysis. In other words, we have achieved a great deal for patients. That is why I would ask everyone to be rather more cautious, perhaps, in their arguments for and against this package. On the two points concerning the WTO, I have tabled an amendment myself, but I think the most sensible approach is for the Commission to put forward a proposal next year which deals fully with this topic and does not simply produce detailed legislation on the hoof, which would not be a good approach. I therefore urge all fellow Members who may have a rather critical viewpoint to support this compromise tomorrow. It will benefit Europe’s citizens, and that is a real gift to patients, no one else.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in examining the legislation before us, we need to consider whether more EU involvement is needed when it comes to approving innovative medicinal products, or whether the mutual recognition procedure is the best approach. In other words, do we want a more integrated internal market for medicinal products with a view to giving patients throughout Europe swifter access to new, safe and effective medicines, or is the idea that extremely complicated authorisation procedures should continue to keep new medicines out of patients' hands for as long as possible? I would like to argue in favour of the wider registration of medical products with new active substances. This has advantages not only for patients, but also for companies, because they can market medicines more quickly than up to now and thus enhance their competitiveness. The support proposed for SMEs should compensate for the drawbacks of the centralised authorisation procedure, which do hit them. As I see it, legislation should focus on patients and their needs. That means that safety and the effectiveness of medical products must play a key role in the authorisation procedure. The procedure must be transparent. Patients, doctors and companies alike must therefore have access to any information not covered by business secrecy protection. In future, comprehensive information on progress with the authorisation procedure, on clinical tests carried out and on side effects and the prices of medical products will be downloadable at any time from a public database. In this connection, I regret that the Commission's information project on asthma, diabetes and AIDS did not receive the support of a majority of the committee. The Commission proposal was certainly ambiguous and gave rise to fears that advertising for prescription medicines was to be permitted. However, the committee's decision meant that an opportunity to improve patient information has been lost. I feel sure that this ought to be put right over the next few years. Pharmacovigilance, that is to say monitoring and reporting of side effects, is important to the safety of a medical product. The obligation to report side effects and submit periodic reports to the authorisation authority ensures continuous comprehensive assessment of any given medical product. There is a very effective safety net in the field of pharmacovigilance. This makes it easier to ascertain side effects and makes it possible to act quickly in the event of a crisis. For these reasons it will be possible to dispense with the procedure for relicensing products every five years. Another key aspect of reform is the plan to prepare the boards and committees of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for their future remits and for the enlargement of the EU. The structure of the EAEMP is intended to reflect that of the EU Food Safety Authority, with an open application procedure for the Management Board and the Executive Director. Anyone wishing to become a member of one of the agency's boards or committees should have a high degree of scientific expertise and must declare any relevant interests. In addition to the existing scientific committees, there will in future be a committee for herbal medicinal products with the same status. This will make voluntary central authorisation for herbal medicines possible, giving patients throughout Europe the option of using tried and tested herbal medicines. In addition to health protection, which is important for patients, there is also the issue of competitiveness and innovation in Europe's pharmaceutical industry. The harmonisation of data exclusivity is certainly a step towards increased competitiveness. Under the present arrangements, data exclusivity in Europe ranges from six to ten years, and this is in urgent need of harmonisation. The 10-year-rule gives a signal to pharmaceutical companies to intensify research and market truly innovative products. However, it also gives a signal to generic drug manufacturers to use the Bolar provisions. As I see it, the Commission proposal is a successful attempt to strike a balance between the justifiable desire of pharmaceutical companies to protect their data and the need of public health systems to improve access to cost-effective generic drugs. All in all, the legislation before us will make an important contribution to improving health protection in Europe, which will be of lasting benefit to patients. (Applause)

 Mr President, I agree with those who have said that public health protection is the most important objective, but that research also needs to be promoted. By means of the research incentives envisaged we will not only be making industry more competitive and thus safeguarding around 500 000 jobs in Europe, we will also be promoting the development of new medicinal products. The proposal for a regulation and the two directives before us do, however, at the same time demand that the pharmaceutical industry, in view of the almost ideal framework conditions – data exclusivity standards are nowhere else as high as in Europe – should demonstrate its capacity for innovation. Patients need innovative new medical products and not analogous products that burden our health systems without providing any extra benefit for patients. I believe that as the consultation procedure moves forward, Parliament should not lose sight of the triple objective of improving health protection, enhancing productivity and safeguarding jobs.

Mr President, Commissioner, we manufacture products, but what do we do with a product when its life cycle comes to an end? The Green Paper is about answering this question from an ecological point of view. So far, in my opinion, we have been giving inadequate answers to this question, with well-known consequences: substantial detriment to the environment by production and the use to which products are put, with associated detriment to the health of workers and consumers. Rather than carry on with this policy, we should get serious about one that is integrated. In that way, we shall be able to make financial savings and will not need to eliminate environmental damage. For these reasons, too, we need a strategy for the development of more environmentally friendly products and services. The report before us, completed by the amendments adopted in Committee, provides a good framework for a product policy on ecological lines. The Commission proposal for the discussion process in Committee was of little help, though. The statements made in this text were couched in vague terms, there were no evident structures for further action, nor was there any evidence of a coordinated discussion process. I do not think that any entrepreneur or consumer is going to be won over to an environmentally friendly product by such a hotchpotch of proposals. The Commission must see to it that the statements made in its forthcoming texts are of greater clarity. What is important to my group is that the environmental costs as a whole should be reflected in the prices of products. Tax incentives should also be guaranteed so that disadvantaged consumers can also buy environmentally friendly products. European product standardisation must be involved to a greater extent, and services should also be made subject to environmental criteria. Another option for the creation of a market for environmentally friendly products would be, for example, the use of economic guidance instruments. We should monitor their use and the effect they have, and it is vitally important that we should ensure that EU environmental legislation is not neutralised. In view of the unsatisfactory text produced by the Commission, the rapporteur has done a good job, but further action must not be limited to contributions to discussion. We urgently need definite proposals for the promotion of environmentally friendly products. Producers and consumers must be made sensitive to the various aspects of environmental quality. This report is a start, but the real work on its content remains to be done.

Mr President, water is the Number One food. I therefore consider constant use of water and protection of water resources to be indispensable. One means by which this may be achieved is, as required by the water framework directive, a price for water that covers costs, comprising the environmental costs and the cost of infrastructure and of treatment. Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used. Careful use of water is encouraged by having a basic price for basic services and increasing prices for use over and above that. The basic price must also take social aspects into account, for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society. One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture. The reduction of water subsidies in agriculture and the careful use of water resources will only be achieved by promoting rural development and finding new sources of income for farmers. Water polluters must also be called to account, which means that the 'polluter pays' principle applies. Every water consumer in Europe should additionally receive a statement of how much water he has used and how the price he pays for his water is made up. I see it as an important question, how much of a market we permit and whether private commitment conflicts with public and regionally-organised water supply and careful use of water. I believe that cooperation between public and private undertakings using private know-how and capital is an option when it comes to making the best use of water resources from an ecological and economic point of view, without regional supply zones being given up. So here I am not talking about deregulation and competition at any price, but about ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly water supply.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Paper before us has, in my opinion, served its purpose. All of the stakeholders – the Commission, Parliament, the companies and associations – have held in-depth discussions in the last few months about the advantages and disadvantages of PVC as a material. Industry's repeated request to exclude certain options from the process of reflection – such as, for example, substituting PVC with alternatives or finding replacements for the stabilisers cadmium and lead – must be refused. In my opinion, in a Green Paper nothing must be off-limits and no possibilities must be ignored if we wish to have a sound basis for deciding on a comprehensive strategy. Mr Sacconi's report remedies the deficiencies in the Green Paper in a balanced way. Thus, it is not only the critical waste-related issues which are assessed, but the entire lifecycle of PVC and possible alternatives. I also believe that it is important for the social dimension, the impact on jobs, to be integrated into the reflection process alongside the ecological and economic aspects. Because of its long lifespan PVC certainly presents advantages in some products, but these are reduced by the stabilisers used. Urgent efforts should therefore be made to find substitutes for these two toxic substances. In addition the percentage of material recycled must be increased. The debate about phthalates, which we have already had in connection with toys, must be urgently concluded with an independent scientific risk assessment. I hope that the last outstanding report will be included in the assessment of soft PVC in the Green Paper. Overall I think that if we make the right decision tomorrow we will have a good basis for a comprehensive PVC strategy.

 Mr President, in response to the rapporteur’s intervention, I should like to clear up one small point. The amendments to this report were tabled by myself. I just want to straighten that out because Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s name was mentioned. Azocolourants are dyes which release cancer-causing aromatic amines if they come into contact with human skin or with the mouth cavity. That was also the reason why a number of Member States issued interim regulations to protect consumers, as well as the reason for the Commission’s initiative, which we are discussing this evening, whereby azocolourants are now to be prohibited throughout the EU and a ban placed on imports of these substances from third countries. The draft we have from the Commission nonetheless has some gaps in it which compromise safety and which, in my opinion, need to be closed. That is the purpose of my amendments, to which a large majority of the committee agreed. We are mainly concerned with adding two further amines to the banned list because they have since been categorised as carcinogenic. Moreover, the general description of the area of application that has been given is too vague. We want an exhaustive, clearly defined list for the purpose of creating clarity and legal certainty. By means of the voluntary stamp of quality and the interim deadline of 1 January 2006, we have also succeeded in taking account of the special problems presented by the oriental carpets industry and, in spite of these problems, in also including hand-made oriental carpets in the directive in the medium term. We have also provided for an option whereby, until such time as new testing methods have been validated, two methods can be applied which take account of the differing demands which materials make upon the testing method. With the adoption of these amendments, which have been decided upon by a large majority of the committee, any vagueness and lack of clarity in the directive would, all in all, be removed. In this way, the directive would do justice to the demands which will have to be made upon it in view of the risk of actual damage to public health.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a directive we have here as an inadequate attempt to ban the use of six phthalates in toys for infants under three years old on the basis of the opinion of the Scientific Committee. As I see it, this goes no further than accepting the inevitable, and the proposal does not comply with the precautionary principle, which it is particularly important to apply when it comes to small children. Until it has been proved that all phthalates are harmless, there is no place for plasticisers in toys for children under three. Children in this age group will put any toy in their mouths. They learn about the shape of toys and the materials used to make them by putting toys in their mouths, and these children should be able to suck toys like this without any risk to their health. This can only be achieved by a ban on all phthalates in toys. We also need labelling for the three to six age group. This is not only because there are smaller children who play with toys produced for older children, but also because there are also children in this age group who still suck things. In addition, we want to help parents in deciding what to buy and in sorting out what toys are unsuitable for their children. The amendments before us, which call for a review after two years, for the evaluation of new test methods and for scientific studies on the dangers of PVC products, are helpful in maximising health protection for us all in the long term, not just for small children. To sum up then, it is for us to decide whether to opt for the precautionary principle and a high degree of protection, or whether we intend to hide behind scientific reports, which can, however, never relieve us of the responsibility of taking the necessary political decisions.

Mr President, we have not yet given up on the goal of a common European label, at least that is my interpretation of the common position. The eco-label may have suffered thus far from a lack of acceptance, but a working plan which allows for coordination with the national labels can only increase acceptance. Our proposal in committee to automatically award the eco-label to products and services which already carry national labels and which satisfy the requirements of the European label did not, unfortunately, achieve a majority. It would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the European label even more quickly and effectively. An important issue is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations. It is essential that expert opinion and protection of consumer interests have some influence on the awarding process. This can only benefit the status and merit of what the label stands for in terms of ecology and the consumer.  The aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations. There is much to be said on the question of fees. We need to introduce a system which covers the costs and it is therefore not right at this stage to fix maximum fees, which would seem premature until such time as we know the actual costs involved. In this regard I would disagree with Mr Schnellhardt because it seems to me that even though the well-known national labels do give rise to costs, suppliers are still happy to acquire them. It is right, however, that there should be a cost reduction for SMEs and for products from developing countries. Overall, we must succeed in establishing the European label in Member States which do not have their own label. If the common label has a function at present, it is that of filling the environmental label gaps in Europe. The path which we are taking is the correct one, but a recognised common European label is not yet in sight and a major effort is required in this area. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I note that there is still a great need for discussion and we will indeed continue with it in the next parliamentary term. Let me begin by expressing my best wishes and thanks to the rapporteur. He really had his hands full with one of the most difficult and important reports in this parliamentary term, and he has done an outstanding job of it. Some important comments have already been made. I would like to emphasise once again that it is a good thing that we have now formulated a uniform methodology. In this way, we can in future get rid of the mosaic of different toll systems with markedly varying charges. It is also extremely important for us that it has been possible to apply the full cost principle and to include infrastructure older than 15 years. There is, of course, another point that is close to my heart. The purpose of the Directive is not only to generate financial resources for the infrastructure, important though that indeed is. The purpose of the Directive is also to contribute to the control and management of transport, above all through levying appropriate charges. We will do this on the one hand through the differentiation of the toll and on the other through the possibility of cross-finance. In the differentiation of the toll, we will be able for the first time to allow for external costs such as ground contamination, blockage and noise costs. This represents a first step towards the comprehensive internalisation of the environmental costs, a result not to be underestimated. My group also endorses Amendment No 55, which deals with a further differentiation in these areas. As regards the increase of the toll for the purpose of cross-finance, the rapporteur has indeed proposed an excellent compromise. It is right that we have expanded the definition of the sensitive areas – something about which I absolutely do not agree with Mr Jarzembowski – so that the conurbations are also included in them, because that is where the most serious noise and emission problems occur. We have certainly not come up with the best solution, and it would be a pity if we now only get as far as the first reading. I look forward to the further discussion in the next parliamentary term and to future debates on the subject.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the good cooperation. Safety is the key issue in air travel – as it is in other sectors, but it is particularly so in air travel, not only since the tragic accident at Sharm-el-Sheik. As air travel is global, more and more third-country aircraft are using EU airports. One black sheep is enough to undermine safety. The directive which we will adopt tomorrow is therefore extremely important in the transport policy context and, indeed, in the eyes of the general public. We are finally establishing uniform Europe-wide procedures for safety checks on third-country aircraft, thus guaranteeing a high level of safety. In my view, the following points are important: firstly, the carrying out of uniform apron checks on aircraft about which a particular suspicion exists, as well as spot-check inspections in the case of aircraft in which defects have already been identified frequently in the past, and on all others; and secondly, the collection and dissemination of all relevant information on safety, as well as on specific incidents and the measures implemented. This transparency will result in the existence of black lists or white lists sooner or later. Naturally, I would prefer white lists, which is what the French Government once proposed, as a kind of quality seal for the safe airlines and also organisers of package travel, which would benefit all passengers and ensure greater transparency. Thirdly, measures adopted at national level, such as flight bans and so on, can be extended to all Member States in line with the relevant procedure. In my view, given the ever-increasing volume of air traffic, these efforts to achieve harmonisation come at the right time.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU Transport Ministers finally agreed on a Common Position on the reform of the Slot Regulation at the end of last year. I say 'finally' because Parliament had waited for more than one and a half years. Nonetheless, the Common Position takes into account many, although not all, of Parliament's amendments. Let me give you some examples. Firstly, the coordinator's independence remains untouched. In this context, we felt it was important to ensure a separation between coordinators and any individual party, to guarantee coordinators' financial independence, and above all to protect coordinators from claims for damages. The Council took up this issue. Coordinators are protected from claims for damages, except in cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct. This ensures their independence and means that they are not susceptible to undue financial pressure. At the same time, the coordinators' powers to impose penalties in the event of misuse of slots have been expanded. The most important advance for the future is, of course, the Transport Ministers' recognition of the new definition of slots as usage rights. This change in the system is essential, in my view, also for the second phase of the future Slot Regulation. The Council also followed our decision and has maintained flexibility and planning certainty for airlines. For example, the re-timing of grandfather rights continues to be possible, either for operational reasons or if re-timing of a series of slots brings the operator closer into line with the slots originally applied for. Here, we believe, the Commission was too restrictive. In addition, the range of exemptions to the 'use-it-or-lose-it' rule has been broadened. Now, unforeseeable events, such as 11 September, and unavoidable circumstances outside the air carrier's control do not lead to the withdrawal of a slot. These few examples show that from Parliament's perspective – from our perspective – we have achieved a great deal. We therefore intend to, and should, vote for the Common Position without amendment so that the Regulation can finally be adopted. One point is of major importance to me, and that is the famous Article 8a of the Regulation, which deals with slot mobility. Here, the Transport Ministers deleted the prohibition of slot trading. This means that there is still a black hole in the Regulation into which slots disappear. It means that slots will continue to be traded in an untransparent and uneven way – not only at Heathrow. This is an untenable situation for the internal market. I therefore urge the Commission to present a new proposal before the end of the year. This proposal must set clear and transparent rules for slot trading on a Europe-wide basis. Only then will the reform of the slot allocation system genuinely be complete. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their good cooperation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner is right: intermodal transport is competitive only to a limited extent, and the existing units – whether they are containers or swap bodies –cannot be easily used in all four modes of transport. The complicated and lengthy process of trans-shipment not only wastes a great deal of time; it also costs a great deal of money. By its very nature, intermodal transport is therefore at a disadvantage. Firstly, it is far more complex and therefore more complicated to organise, and secondly, there are very few actors who have a clear overview of the whole intermodal chain. That is why we must promote intermodal transport, and that is what we are doing with this directive. The purpose of the directive is three-fold: firstly, to create a new loading unit, the 
European intermodal loading unit; secondly, to establish specific intermodality requirements for all new loading units, and we hope that at least in the medium term, we will therefore be able to halve the trans-shipment time at terminals; and thirdly, to improve safety in line with 

the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC). Perhaps it was slightly misleading for the Commission to present the directive as part of the programme for the Promotion of Short Sea Shipping. Yes, of course it will benefit short sea shipping, but what we are talking about here is the entire transport chain and intermodal standardisation the like of which has not been seen before. As a rule, it is the individual modes of transport which are standardised, or standardisations are introduced for specific aspects of an individual mode of transport. This directive is therefore a first. The purpose of standardisation, however, is not only to identify an ideal technical solution. Through standardisation, we will achieve planning and investment security, reduce barriers to market entry as well as product costs, and open up new markets. I am convinced that Europe needs the best possible intermodal loading unit combining the advantages of containers with the advantages of swap units. It would be a kind of European supercontainer, capable of being used on all modes of transport and trans-shipped easily. It would be stackable and lifted from its top corners; it would be suitable for use on ships, offer maximum space for transporting ISO palettes, and enable loading and unloading to take place quickly. The Commission estimates that the number of road vehicles required to transport the same amount of goods would be reduced by 25% if the new supercontainer were used. I think that is slightly optimistic, but at least it points in the direction of change. Fears that the use of existing loading units would no longer be permissible are unjustified. The use of the new supercontainer is not made mandatory by the directive; instead, the market must regulate it. This means that different units will continue to be in circulation, but the European loading unit will become the market leader because of its stated benefits. I too believe that it will be a great success in the export market. China and Russia are two massive markets to be conquered, and the expected increase in the transportation of goods to Eastern Europe speaks for itself. Nor does the directive affect the ISO norm. We have managed to assuage concerns about this issue through amendments to the Commission’s text. Cellular container ships, for example, are currently configured according to applicable ISO standards. We have stipulated that safe stowage inside and on deck of existing cellular container ships must be possible without adaptation of currently existing cell guides. We have also stipulated an external height of 2 900 mm, which corresponds to the height laid down by the European Organisation for Standardisation (CEN). We have thus created the best possible loading unit for road and rail. It must, though, be the European standardisation bodies, in conjunction with industry, that have the task of developing the detail of the standardisation. We have simply set a framework for this process. We wanted, or want, to create a standardisation procedure based on a mandate, so that standardisation can proceed more quickly. Efforts to achieve this have been under way for a long time, but they have not been concluded. This directive is merely the start of the process. Apart from the loading units, there are many other possible areas of intermodal transport where standardisation would be possible, for example at the interfaces between infrastructure and services, that is, terminals, trans-shipment facilities and, of course, information systems, liability and contractual regulations. Standardisation will therefore continue. I am pleased that we have made a start here, sending out a clear signal in favour of intermodal transport.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work he has done and for his good cooperation. Commissioner, you once shared with us a vision of how we would in future be able to fly directly from A to B within Europe, thus enabling much better use to be made of capacity, reducing delays to a marked degree, radically minimising safety risks by, in short order, creating a few functional airspace blocks in Europe, and putting an end to the patchwork in the skies above Europe. What we have ended up with is a sort of ‘Single Sky lite
’. Politically speaking, it is clear, nothing more could be achieved, and agreement between the Council and Parliament was reached only at the very last minute – quite literally, at five minutes to twelve. As it is the overall result that matters to us, Parliament has moved a long way and has acceded to many of the Council’s wishes and concerns. It has to be said that the Council of Ministers gave us the distinct impression that the national point of view continued to predominate – and that impression remains. The result is that we have flown in the right direction but have landed well short of the runway. Particularly where military-civilian cooperation is concerned, Parliament had to be very careful of national sensitivities and was in fact obliged to abandon the concept of flexible use of airspace. Substantial areas of airspace continue to be barred to any but military traffic. While a direct flight from Rome to Brussels has presented no problems in navigational terms for some time now, it will not be possible in future, which is economic and environmental nonsense. We have in any case made progress in that the Member States have, for the first time, acknowledged that the only way to ensure the safe and efficient use of airspace is for the military and civilian users of it to cooperate, irrespective of how this is to be arranged in future. I cannot, though, do other than agree with Mr Fava when I say that, as regards the functional airspace blocks, which are at the heart of the Single Sky, the result was less than what the facts of the situation demanded, for a real Community solution would have been needed, with the Commission having clear decision-making competence. That, unfortunately, is something we could not get accepted; here too, the Member States still have the last word, but decisive progress has been made in that they are, for the first time, obliged to negotiate about the establishment of cross-border airspace blocks. Moreover, the Commission is to closely monitor developments, review the situation after five years and propose any changes that may be needed to the system; like Mr Schmitt, I hope that it will. To put it in plain language, the Member States can no longer evade their responsibilities, as they did over past decades, now that they are under close observation, and both Parliament and the Commission expect great things of them. To sum up, the outcome may well not be the quantum leap in air transport that we had hoped for and that had been heralded, but we have started to stake out the ground and can look forward to more Europe above the clouds in the future. Turning to the integration of lower airspace that is being contemplated and – if I may go one step further – the creation of a single trans-European airspace, I hope that the topic of flexible airspace use and, of course, of functional airspace blocks can again ...

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having removed the structural defect in the Commission proposal, by which I mean the requirement that systems be interoperable before they are abolished, the report points in a direction with which we can all agree, and for that thanks are due to the rapporteur. Our essential need is for a toll system that is compatible right across Europe and built to a standard that will last into the future. Europe has, since the 1990s, seen the introduction of a multitude of different toll systems, all stitched together in a patchwork, and there would be many more patches were it not for this directive. The directive is intended to make it possible, in future, to get right across Europe with one technological item and one contract, and what that means is that the systems will have to be compatible by 2007. Looking further ahead, it recommends the introduction of a satellite-based toll system and, at the same time, calls on the Commission to submit, by 2009, a strategy for the conversion of the services. That was what our group had demanded, and I am glad that we have the rapporteur’s backing in this. Why are we recommending a satellite-based toll system? We do so because it has the potential to add value to our transport policy. If I might use a rather laboured analogy, I do not buy a typewriter and then a computer if I am going to be putting my documents on the Internet. A satellite-based toll system also promises more for the future, firstly, because it can – provided that the political will is present – provide comprehensive and cross-border coverage of vehicles, and, secondly, because – as my colleague Mr Swoboda said – it provides a basis on which future traffic flows can be directed and on which different modes of transport can be logistically interlinked. Thirdly, it will be possible to use it in combination with mobile communications technology as a means towards introducing other services, such as, for example, rapid help in the event of accidents, local hazard warnings and the tracking of dangerous goods, to name but a few. Perhaps the Commission should have put greater emphasis on these technical considerations. I would be happy if we could complete this directive within the life of this Parliament; after first reading would be best of all.

 One thousand and fifty passengers are denied boarding in Europe every year despite having a valid ticket in their pockets. Flight cancellations and delays are also increasing, especially in the tourist season. That is not in the consumer’s interests. My group therefore welcomes the regulation. It will give us a uniform European legal framework, probably from 2005. I am sure we have succeeded in achieving a fair balance between the interests of consumers and carriers. The excessive level of compensation sought by the Commission has been cut back to a realistic amount. The reference to extraordinary circumstances reduces carriers’ responsibility to a reasonable level. I therefore anticipate that the Council will follow Parliament in agreeing to the outcome of conciliation. This represents an advance over the existing arrangements because we now have a list of benefits to which passengers are legally entitled, not just in cases of overbooking as before, but also when flights are cancelled or delayed. At the heart of the improvement are the compensation payments, which are twice as high as was hitherto the norm in Europe under the voluntary arrangements. For example, if I get to Tegel before finding out that my flight from Berlin to Mallorca has been cancelled, I not only get my ticket replaced, but I also get EUR 400 compensation. I get the same amount if I am left behind because of overbooking. This also places a measure of pressure on airlines to be more sensitive in their use of the overbooking system, necessary as it is. Of course, we also hope that greater efforts will be made to reduce delays and the occasional abusive cancellation of flights when they are not quite full. One side effect of the regulation will be to reduce the gap in the terms of competition between budget and traditional airlines. We are now setting standards for passenger rights in aviation which sooner or later ought to apply for other modes of transport as well.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schmitt is indeed right to say that today marks the first anniversary of the calamity at Überlingen, when two aircraft collided, resulting in many deaths. The public see the Single Sky project as the European response to the situation in the skies above Europe, which is, to say the least, unsatisfactory. So how do matters stand? We have three times as many control centres as an area of comparable size in the USA, with a patchwork carpet – a product of the Sixties – in the skies above us. If you fly from Brussels to Rome, you have to pass through nine different control sectors; during a flight from Brussels to Geneva, the radio frequency has to be changed five times. With the number of journeys by air continuing to mount over the coming years, the whole thing is more and more a safety hazard, and, at the same time, highly inefficient; one in every four flights is delayed, and 350 000 flying hours are wasted every year. All that costs the airlines some two thousand million euros per annum. The Commission, with its regulatory package, and Parliament, at first reading stage, faced up to this challenge, but the Member States’ Common Position does not do it justice in terms of what is expected and required. Why is this so? The first reason for this is that, at the heart of the single sky, there are the functional airspace blocks. How are these to become reality? What is the added value of a regulation if its implementation is to continue to be dependent on the whims of the Member States? They can already set up airspace blocks on a bilateral basis. We take the view that nothing will change here unless we get a normative proposal from Eurocontrol and the Commission. My second point is that, in the Common Position, we have made hardly any real progress away from the status quo in terms of civil/military cooperation either. I know this is a highly sensitive issue, but we cannot wait a few decades more for people to be able to fly within Europe by a direct route from A to B. Thirdly, it is a cause of anguish that there has been no European response to the desperate lack of air traffic controllers. This must be included in the regulatory package and – not least for safety reasons – should be tackled as soon as possible. My group endorses the reintroduction of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading stage. No doubt we will have to have frank discussions with the Council in the Conciliation Committee. Thanks are due not least to the rapporteurs for their good and cooperative approach to our work together.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that overbookings, cancellations and delays are particularly frequent occurrences in the summer months that lie before us, and so the news we convey will be understood by all. It is that, in future, passengers will have greater legal certainty. When these things happen, they will get substantially better assistance and twice as much by way of compensation, not only on regular services but also on charter flights and in respect of various services offered by travel operators. It is, unfortunately, only next summer that this good news for passengers will be for real. While this is, on the one hand, attributable to the difficult situation in which airlines currently find themselves, it also represents an opportunity – an opportunity to supply all passengers, in good time, with comprehensive information, comparable, for example, to the charter of passengers’ rights displayed at all airports. Perhaps the airlines will get together and set up a desk at each airport, one that would be readily recognisable and at which passengers could make claims. After all, the best laws are of no use if they are not known about and if they cannot be implemented in a consumer-friendly way. We are grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done. He has always sought compromise, and has worked well with all the political groups. We nonetheless have two points of disagreement with him. One has to do with package flights, where it is not quite clear what he really wants. We are convinced that they do not belong in the regulation, as they are covered by their own directive. The second has to do with how compensation for cancellations is to be handled, where we will endorse the Council’s approach, which is more consumer-friendly than what the rapporteur has proposed. The amount paid by way of compensation should depend on the time of notification and on the extent to which the alternative flights offered differ from the original travel contract. What might the side-effects of the regulation be? The best thing would of course be if the cases described were to be drastically reduced in future. If they are caused by unforeseen circumstances, additional competition between airlines might help to make them more user-friendly. This might also mean that, in addition to the areas already referred to, indicators could also show the reliability of baggage handling and the subjective perceptions of the quality of the service that the airlines provide. For that reason, there is a need in Europe for a ranking of user-friendliness, such as exists in the USA. As a number of Members have said, it is indeed the case that we could do with comparable rules for all carriers, but the fact that we have not yet been able to come up with rules for other carriers is not a reason for dispensing with them in air travel.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for support under the Marco Polo instrument to be made available to European actors in the field of freight transport; the sense of urgency with which this is awaited is demonstrated by the large number of applications submitted in response to what was a small-scale announcement. By precisely targeting specific objects of assistance, the support programme aims to bring about the transfer of goods from the roads to more environmentally friendly means of transport. As part of this project to transfer traffic, for example, it was possible to give support to a barge service taking cargo to the Czech Republic from Magdeburg or from Hamburg. The catalyst actions call for particularly creative responses to structural obstacles. In my view, they should trigger huge demand, above all in rail transport, where – as is well known – the obstacles are numerous. This means that Marco Polo is a good addition to the railway packages that we have introduced. In view of the urgent need for cross-border consultation on common priorities for the removal of obstacles, I could well imagine the third area for support – common learning actions – including the corridor conferences that Parliament has been demanding for so long. The fact that there is demand from so many quarters shows, of course, that the money will not be sufficient, and nor are we likely to achieve the objective of stabilising the 1998 modal split. It is fortunate that our request, that projects from the future Member States be included already, has been complied with. One does not have to be a prophet to be able to foresee the re-emergence of the issues of environmental compatibility and sustainability on the transport policy agenda at the time of the forthcoming elections.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after almost one and a half years of debate on the White Paper and therefore on our transport policy strategy, we now have a report that is by and large capable of winning a majority. Our thanks go to the rapporteur for his successful consensus-building, which is always an arduous task. The White Paper itself certainly deserves the epithet strategic, because it keeps in view the idea of optimising European transport as a whole and because it underpins its objective of achieving a balanced distribution of transport needs across transport modes with around 60 specific individual measures. The exact same number – exactly 60 – of specific legislative proposals are still gathering dust in the Council. That is the reality of transport policy and I think it is a scandal. Purely arithmetically speaking we are therefore practically back in 1992, at the beginning of the process of implementing the last White Paper. I should like to stress two points today. Firstly, we urgently need a compromise on matters concerning Galileo. There is a danger that the deadlock will call into question one of our flagship projects in transport and industrial policy. It is surely absurd that first no Member State wanted to pay and now they are arguing about whether more should be paid. In terms of development, we were three years ahead of the American GPS3 system. We frittered away one year, the Americans are catching up another year by pumping in huge investment, and if we do not get our skates on we will forfeit the success of the project that we are so eagerly awaiting. Secondly, there is a lot of movement in the European skies and this is now reflected in our legislation. Now that the single sky project has been kicked into the right orbit, we would encourage the Commission to complete its open skies strategy, even if this runs counter to national interests, because we need a single European sky. One more point to finish with: we actually ought not to have debates on transport policy every ten years, but on a continuous basis, including here in the plenary and, as we are doing today, at a reasonable hour.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur. In our view, the compromise that was struck in the committee constitutes a significant step towards greater consumer protection. At long last we have legal security on additional issues and not just voluntary commitments from the airlines. Moreover, the regulation is of course also being extended to cover severe delays and flight cancellations. I was not infrequently the victim of cancellations by the former airline Sabena. No doubt other Members have had similar experiences with other airlines. Last but not least we are doubling the current levels of compensation, which will also be more subtly differentiated than hitherto and divided into three bands. Clearly, the issue that we most need to discuss is the level of compensation. The objective of the regulation cannot be to abolish the practice of overbooking, but it can be to ensure that this procedure is used in a more reasonable, customer-oriented way. Of course, we could also eliminate overbooking, as the low-cost carriers have done, if, on the other hand, flights were non-exchangeable and a no-show meant that a flight was automatically forfeited. But this is neither consumer-friendly nor justifiable on environmental grounds. Consumers need flexibility when they are planning their journeys and half-empty planes make no sense at all from an environmental point of view. The economic argument is even more persuasive. If overbooking were abolished, air prices would inevitably rise and we cannot expect either consumers to put up with this or indeed the airlines, which are up against international competition. A further reason why we can support the compromise struck in the committee on compensation levels is because we think it is important for consumers to benefit from these improved and binding rules as quickly as possible and not have to wait for them for years because the legislation is, as is so often the case, still sitting in the Council. In the interests of consumers, my group will be voting against part of Amendment No 29, because we think that compensation only for flights that are cancelled up to 48 hours before departure is unreasonable. At least two weeks is required here and this should be negotiated afterwards with the Council and the Commission. In addition, we think that the inclusion of package tours in the Commission proposal is unnecessary, because they are covered by the directive on package tourism. The fact that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has advocated the introduction of a scheme to rank airlines by user-friendliness is a strong vote in favour of the consumer. A ranking system of this kind, as is quite usual in the USA, can help to stimulate competition between the airlines on quality and on which provides the most consumer-friendly overall service. I hope that this proposal is also upheld in the plenary. Against the background of the current situation, this report represents a determined step towards greater consumer-friendliness. Many a consumer dream may fly on, but they are hopelessly overbooked. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European solidarity is within our grasp! Now and in the future, aid can be given at once when disasters strike. It is with gratitude that I, as a MEP from Saxony-Anhalt, see with what speed and unanimity the Commission and Parliament act. I have also found, among the flood victims in my region, that the European ideal can hardly be more clearly communicated than by aid. It is perhaps auspicious that we find ourselves debating this solidarity on this historic day when the enlargement of the Community has taken on a definite shape, for the Solidarity Fund is already open to the candidate countries and our solidarity is already being extended to them. My group's concern is to retain as far as possible the precision of Commissioner Barnier's fine proposal for a regulation. The Solidarity Fund is an instrument of aid, one that makes immediate aid possible and whose tasks must be clearly distinguished from those of the Structural Fund. I would like to highlight two amendments to the Commission draft. Firstly, I wish to follow Mr Berend in highlighting the more comprehensive definition of a disaster, which we wanted, and which will allow us to respond flexibly to future catastrophic events that would otherwise be hard to include under the Commission proposal, for example droughts or the fallout from acts of terrorism. Secondly, the extension to three months of the period in which application to the Fund must be made. This gives an appropriate response time to those candidate countries that are as yet less well equipped to deal with administration and does justice to a situation in which important parts of the administration have also been destroyed. Although this is not relevant to the Solidarity Fund, our discussion today should make reference to the call for a future European civilian emergency force. The flood disaster has shown that, whatever the efforts made, there were significant deficiencies in the leadership of operations, in materials, logistics and communication, at any rate as regards the cross-border dimension. This needs to be remedied. The Commission should start by encouraging or supporting joint exercises by fire brigades, by the agencies for technical aid, by the rescue services and so on in border areas. In the medium term, this could give rise to a logistically unitary aid network or even a civilian solidarity corps, which could indeed be deployable in the event of disasters outside the Community, for example after an earthquake such as that which recently struck Turkey. It is a vision such as that on which we should be working, and we should not wait until after the next disaster. My thanks – for I must not forget him – to the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Marco Polo is a well thought-out instrument that is designed to promote a shift in freight transport from road to more environmentally friendly modes of transport, and this at international level. It is a practical instrument that will help us to achieve the aim that we have in transport policy, which is, as you know, to stabilise the modal split at its 1998 levels, or restore it to those levels. Hopefully it will be operational as early as next year. Other measures that we envisaged in the White Paper – for example, the first railway package, which we have already adopted, and the second, which we are now working on; cross-financing from road to rail; charges for heavy goods vehicles; internalising external costs – will all only have an effect in the long term or at the very earliest in the medium term if we really get them on track. The Commission's three proposed actions in the programme have clearly been inspired by its experience with PACT. After all, this was a very successful programme, which achieved a great deal over many years, even if the focus is now rather different. Although we now have more money than under PACT, the challenge is also greater, and that is why we need to ensure that the programme's scope is very precisely delimited. In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in a coalition of common sense in transport policy, we managed by and large to identify the main focus of the instrument. In the plenary, however, we are having to work together to fend off two attempts to render this programme of assistance powerless by extending it. The first is a proposal to extend the scope to include intermodal transport. My group opposes the rapporteur's Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 12, because they again seek to contribute, indirectly, to subsidising road freight transport. I do not have anything against intermodality, but that is not the aim this time round; this time it is first and foremost about modal shift. Secondly, we must reject an extension of the scope to transport prevention actions. My group opposes the amendments re-tabled by the Greens, seeking in addition to carry out actions on transport prevention on this tight budget. I would be happy at any time to support a new programme on transport prevention, but its inclusion here would overstretch the programme and after all we want to implement it strategically. Here, less is more! Together we agreed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that we do not want any distortions of competition between the environmentally acceptable modes of transport. We have lowered the minimum subsidy thresholds for the actions, as the rapporteur has explained; we have judged cooperation between operators involved in cross-border transport projects – for example in corridor conferences – to be worthy of support, and we want a budget increase to be reconsidered as part of the mid-term review. I hope that the Council and the Commission will respond to our ideas quickly so that the programme can start next year, because the increasing problems with road freight transport mean that delay is not an option.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘and yet it does move’ – European air transport policy, I mean. There are obviously so many pressing problems that Spain and Great Britain have given up their decades-old blockade in the Council. That is a great step forward for Europe. The Single Sky project has a significance in terms of European airspace comparable to that of the introduction of the euro for the European economic and monetary area. I only hope that there is just as much awareness of the problems involved and willingness to resolve them, as the devil is well known to dwell in the details. We can already see quite divergent national interests girding their loins to jeopardise the ambitious objective of making this project a reality by 2004. The reports by Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte show the necessary will to resolve the problems, and I hope that the House does as well. I would also like to say something about a number of core issues that have had a part to play in the discussion and which seem to be important. I still find it hard to understand why the sharing of responsibilities between the Community and Eurocontrol has not been resolved in a truly definitive way. Things still need to be done in that area. My second point is that the Commission was quite right to refer to cooperation between civilian and military authorities, but this does not, in my view, go far enough, since, in the final analysis, there is still an intrinsic need for their air traffic control services to be fully integrated. This area calls for more than what the Commission has proposed. I am aware that this would of course require an ongoing discussion in the institutions, one that would encompass the Common Foreign and Security Policy and not relate solely to transport policy. Thirdly, the provision of air traffic control services calls for independent national supervisory authorities, which would, in the final analysis, need to be institutionally separate from the service providers. As my colleague has pointed out, we would prefer it if we already had a European supervisory authority, but the time for that does not yet seem to have arrived. Fourthly, we need clear procedures for authorisation and appointments and transparent rules on charges. I would ask you, at the present time, not to let yourselves be tangled up in a discussion as to whether air traffic control requires State or private-sector service providers, or else the whole project risks being brought to a standstill, as we have seen happen with public transport. That would be harmful. It is safety that is in the foreground and has priority, along with the facilitation of integrated air traffic control services appropriate to the functional blocks of airspace. My fifth point, which is at the heart of the whole structure, follows from that. We need the creation of functional blocks of airspace. The Commission's description of how we get there is, however, incorrect and inadequate. Here, the need to rid the skies of the small-state mentality means that there is still a need for improvement. We have 26 subsystems, 58 monitoring systems, and different equipment. That is superfluous and, as has already been said, increases the likelihood of error. Safety must be the highest priority. Mrs Maes, your report is one that I cannot but fully support. There are scarcely any objections to it on the part of our group. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Directive is a constituent part of a strategy to combat the noise nuisance at airports and in the areas around them – an issue very close to the public's heart. The strategy's objective is that quieter aircraft must be brought into service and noise charges must become more effective in environmental terms. That is already happening at many airports in the Community, but not by a long way at all of them. The Commissioner is right to say that each Member State has quite different criteria for differentiating between charges and measuring
 the amount of perceived noise. There is a real need for harmonisation. Thus far, the Directive makes sense. It will at one and the same time make for greater transparency and more equal treatment, and make the charges payable by the airlines more predictable, so that, as well as of course markedly improving protection against noise, it will have an incidental effect on competition. The proposal for a directive does, however, have one grave defect, and now I want to sound the same warning note as Mr Jarzembowski in saying that it makes for downward harmonisation, albeit involuntarily. For the proposal for a directive forces the progression to tail off to such a degree that it can no longer be called a perceptible incentive, and that cannot be the objective of our policy on noise and the environment. Frankfurt, London, Paris, Munich, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Madrid, and Stuttgart have other systems of charging for noise, which result in markedly better protection against it, and these must be retained, yet it is precisely that which the Commission proposal would prevent if not amended to some degree. Why is this so? There is no effective economic incentive unless noise charges increase markedly and progressively – and, I emphasise, markedly and progressively – in line with the increase in noise volume. Quiet aircraft 
must therefore benefit and loud aircraft must incur substantial charges. Whatever harmonisation is needed, our objective must still be to keep Europe's standards of noise prevention as high as possible. My group has therefore reintroduced three amendments, which make it clear that charging systems that are already in existence and are more effective in environmental terms, are to be retained. I ask the whole House to support these amendments. It would indeed be absurd to penalise airports that provide far better protection against noise than that which has hitherto been proposed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is more and more going on in the skies above Europe, and, fortunately, also in European policy in the field of air transport. The consequences for the air transport sector of 11 September appear to have been almost overcome, and annual growth rates of up to 5% are again being assumed, which means that air travel will increase twofold by 2015. Whilst we are responding in political terms to this challenge by creating a single European sky, we still need greater capacity at our overstretched airports. There is also a need for more airport infrastructure, but none of us can seriously imagine that we might manage to double the number of runways by 2015, and so we have to generate additional capacity. It is vital that this be done by as efficient as possible a system of allocating takeoff and landing rights on overloaded airports. The old Regulation on slots dates back to 1993 and can no longer cope with present-day challenges; its lack of precision meant that it was not uniformly applied by the Member States. It failed to guarantee fair and transparent allocation of slots, put new applicants at a disadvantage and gave rise to problems such as illicit trading in slots. The Commission proposal on new rules for the allocation of slots is a necessary intermediate step. A final regulation must result from discussions over the next few years. Even though the intermediate step we are taking today appears to many to mainly bring with it technical improvements to details of the old Regulation, it does at the same time have political implications that are necessary from the point of view of regulatory policy and will seem to some people to have a very broad scope. At this point, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their fine cooperation and their concentration on the issues. Despite some differences of opinion, we have succeeded in keeping the balance of the regulatory package as a whole before our eyes. Our improvements to the Commission proposal are intended to make the Commission text more precise, to establish standard European criteria for granting the status of coordinated airports, to further enhance the coordinator's authority and independence, to retain flexibility and security in terms of planning for established air carriers and to promote the new applicants' flexibility and opportunities for gaining access to the market. I want to say something about the individual points. Firstly, at the heart of the Regulation lies a new definition of the slots as a right of usage, and thus the property neither of airlines, nor of airports, but rather a public good. The committee has additionally stipulated that the whole of the airport infrastructure required for a flight falls within the definition of a right of usage. We have for the first time pointed out the connection between airway slots and airport slots, which will make it easier to synchronise the two in the future. My second point is uncontentious but not, for that reason, insignificant. We have further strengthened the position of the coordinator, freeing him from any obligations to pay compensation, which I believe to be indispensable to his independence. We have defined his competences more clearly over against the coordination committee; he has the right to withhold slots if airlines fail to comply with their duty to provide information, and he is entitled to compare his data with other coordinators and schedules facilitators in order to bring to light any inconsistencies in schedules. Thirdly, we should discuss the established airlines' legitimate interests. Contrary to the Commission proposal, we are in favour of them continuing to have the option of re-timing in order to progressively optimise their schedules. We have widened the exceptions to the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ 
rule in order to be able to take the impact of events like those of 11 September, for example, and we have set aside the Commission's proposal that ‘grandfather rights’ should be linked to the size of aircraft, believing as we do that the companies need greater flexibility, which is desirable both for economic and environmental reasons. The alternative would no doubt have been counterproductive. I turn, fourthly, to the legitimate interests of the new carriers. The Commission's definition of new applicants was, admittedly, not agreeable to many of the established airlines, but we consider it right in principle, as there is a fundamental contradiction between the concentration process which can be observed in air transport and the competition for routes that liberalisation is actually seeking to bring about. We have tightened up the definition of new applicants in order further to strengthen them and make it easier for them to transfer and exchange slots. Fifthly, where there are clear rules, there must also be the possibility of sanctions. We have laid it down that slots can be withdrawn after one warning if they are being misused. Member States can also impose fines. Please allow me to end with a glance into the future. Many members of the committee wanted to have new fundamental rules as soon as possible, and that I can understand, as the intermediate step we are taking today does not yet satisfy the need for renewal. However, the effects of this Regulation need first to be evaluated, as the air transport market is both a highly sensitive area and one of great importance to the economy, making a rush job inappropriate. We also still have time – which we need – to seek the consent of the main actors in the air transport market. The study on models for the allocation of slots, produced at the Commission's behest, has speeded up, but certainly not yet completed, this process of reaching a consensus. Our attempt at finding air transport a place in the logic of optimising transport overall could not, unfortunately, be enshrined in the Regulation on slots. I think that is a pity, but we should not lose sight of this facet of future legislation. I hope that the report will get as big a majority in plenary tomorrow as it did in the committee.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's resolution on the Aviation Safety Agency is one of the first of many decisions that we have to take in the area of air transport. A lot is moving in the skies above Europe. The crisis in air transport following 11 September appears in the meantime to have been almost overcome. Movements of aircraft are expected to double again by 2015. The restructuring of air transport is in full swing. The political response to these challenges is represented primarily by the Single European Sky and the optimisation of capacities at airports. The present time demands continuity in the midst of change. Safety in the air must be the highest priority in air transport. Previous strategies to harmonise technical regulations have not been able to keep up with the breakneck pace of developments in the air transport sector. This is another reason why we need the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is to be the heart of a future unitary safety framework. I am glad that we have found a European response in this sensitive area. We can chalk it up as a success in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission that it will be only a year after the Regulation enters into force that requirements for the operation of aircraft and for the approval of aircrew are timetabled to be drawn up, and that these measures are also to be applied to aircraft from third countries. Safety aspects of airports are also to be included. Turning to the agency's accountability, Parliament has succeeded in giving it greater independence, including from the Commission. It has also been laid down that Member States are to make an appropriate contribution when external delegations of the Agency are set up on their territory – a contribution which I think Parliament will take to be financial in nature. As a whole, discussion of the EASA shows that what we actually needed from the Commission is a framework directive on European agencies that would respond to the horizontal issues concerning a unitary structure for agencies. It is still unsatisfactory that the problem of budgeting for agencies' income could not be resolved as the Committee on Budgetary Control would wish. The Aviation Safety Agency will be followed by others, dealing for example with the safety of railways and ships. I consider this overall strategy to be suited to advance the integration of European transport markets.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly the rapporteur deserves our thanks for his consistent report and his committed efforts to reach compromises, the majority of which we will be supporting. However, I have to contradict him somewhat as regards the treatment of the Environment Committee – it may have been legally correct, but from a political point of view it was not exactly optimal. On the actual substance: a third of all European airports are currently suffering noise problems; the problems are continuing to increase and the air transport sector is continuing to grow. We have seen aircraft movements double in the last ten years and perhaps it will take even less time for them to double again, because flying is becoming part of everyday life. I only have to think of the low-cost airlines, enlargement towards the east and other issues; they will quickly lead this sector out of the slump that it has been experiencing because of September 11, and, in fact, the first signs of growth are already visible. The noise problems are increasing in our cities because there is more traffic, and in the conurbations population density is also on the increase. At the same time there is also an increased desire for a better quality of life, which means that people are less willing to tolerate additional noise pollution. That is why it certainly makes sense for us to make every effort to secure a proposal for a directive which is as effective as possible. It makes sense to conclude international agreements because this is of course a global industry. The ICAO agreement on the new chapter four was secured only after laborious negotiations, but of course it does not apply straight away, and that is why it is good that we are introducing these additional possibilities for placing operational restrictions on individual airports, which will enable stricter noise emission standards to be imposed. It is also important for us to adopt a higher profile in ICAO because more international agreements are on the horizon and we will also soon have to be prepared for further international conflicts. That is why it is really important for us to consider what we want to stand up for. I only have to think of the open sky agreements and the issues which will still be on the agenda in connection with subsidised aircraft from third countries. On the other hand, it does not actually make any sense – we are not in any trouble – to curtail the parliamentary procedure, because I think that in the USA they will recognise that parliamentary procedures take time. We see three points rather differently. Firstly, we want it spelt out even more clearly that in five years' time, after the review, moves will be made to increase the limit values; we want this laid down now along with the eight decibels. Secondly, the necessary operational restrictions should take effect as quickly as possible, more quickly in our view than the Commission has proposed – this is more a reflection of the result of the vote in my group than my own personal views. Thirdly, we should perhaps reopen the discussions on the city airports after all, although the compromise which has been reached with the Council and the Commission, as it were to extend the definition so that not only the original four but all of the airports in conurbations count if they handle internal Community traffic, seems to me personally to be right, and I think that my group will also support it in the end, even if it is after some debate. I should like to make two final points: work should continue to conclude international agreements on engines and we will be discussing noise again – specifically overall noise-handling – in the context of the slot regulation, which will be exciting. I am sure that we will achieve workable compromises in the next round. Once again many thanks to the rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first, our thanks to the rapporteur. The Commission proposal for a European Aviation Safety Agency comes in response to a long-standing demand by Parliament. The Aviation Safety Agency is our second agency in the transport sector; a third for the railways and rail safety will ensue. I think this strategy of creating European agencies is an ideal way of helping the European transport markets to integrate. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already proposed a number of important amendments for the Aviation Safety Agency, such as strengthening the agency, giving it more independence and extending its remit. I also think it is important – and I speak here on behalf of Mr Kuckelkorn – that we accept an amendment proposed by the Committee on Budgets on funding. Come what may, we must ensure that we have efficiency, transparency and controlled costs. These two agencies give us the opportunity to take a clear line right from the outset. My group has also tabled a number of proposed amendments. The first concerns the composition of the administrative board. We are calling for employers and employees to be given a seat on the board. Another proposed amendment concerns the creation of local offices of the agency, which have been suggested in order to allay the fears of a number of Member States about loss of sovereignty. We expect the Member State in which the agency is located to make a financial contribution. One purpose of this rule is to prevent a Member State from pressurising its agency, i.e. the agency established on its sovereign territory, into setting up local offices. Here too I am positive that this is a reasonable and legitimate concern on the part of Parliament and I therefore call on you to support it.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ecopoint system was agreed during Austria's accession to the EU. So what we are talking about is an existing, legally valid agreement which expires in 2003. The objective, as has already been mentioned, is to use more environmentally-friendly lorries in transit through the Austrian Alps and to reduce NOx emissions by 60% in comparison with 1992, which has almost been achieved. The agreement also sets an upper ceiling on the number of transit journeys, the so-called 108% clause. Now the Commission wants to abolish the 108% clause by the end of 2003. The rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, rejects the Commission proposal and I concur with this view, although there is a conflict between Austrian and German interests, for example, here. But our concern here must be to act within the context of a European transport policy and that means having a taxation mechanism for ecologically sensitive regions. In all events, I should like to highlight three problems, as I have done in my proposed amendments. First, the number of journeys needs to be calculated correctly. A number of speakers have expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the statistics, because they also include some bilateral journeys. Care must therefore be taken to calculate the number of journeys correctly, so that sanctions are not wrongly applied. That brings me to my second point, sanctions. In 1999, as has already been mentioned, the number of transit journeys was exceeded by 100,000, resulting in a cutback of 150,000 journeys by way of "punishment". I think the current sanction mechanism is excessive and wrong because it hits individual road hauliers, even though it means state action. Something needs to be done here. And my third and final point. Our ultimate transport policy objective is to have a sustainable transport system which allows sustainable mobility in the long term. However, the Commission has so far omitted to present a conclusive overall concept for the Alps for 2003 onwards and we need one now as a matter of urgency.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my Group. He was most cooperative while drafting his report. Basically, the rule of the internal market is that aid distorts competition and is therefore inadmissible. The previous speaker pointed this out. There must be special grounds for exceptions to this rule. In this regulation, the special grounds are: the coordination of inland transport. The prime purpose of aid in this sector is to allow fair competition between road, rail and inland waterway transport. This is the only way of optimising the overall European transport system in the long term, especially in the freight sector. This is the only way we shall ever bring about the much-vaunted intermodal transport chains. In order to make these transport chains as flexible as possible, we want to extend the scope of the regulation to short sea shipping. Government funding for building, maintaining and operating transport infrastructure does not come under the ban on aid, provided that it is available to all users on a non-discriminatory basis. This should apply irrespective of the legal form of the infrastructure operator. This is the only way of ensuring that railways and ports are treated on a equal footing with roads. Now to aid for use of the infrastructure. Aid for using transport infrastructure should reflect the widely varied costs incurred by society from the choice of mode of transport. In other words, both the infrastructure and the external costs must be included when calculating aid. Equality of competition between the modes of transport is safeguarded by paying the difference between the unpaid costs of two carriers to the social and more environmentally-friendly carrier in the form of aid in order to make it cheaper and more attractive to use. Unfortunately – and this has also already been addressed – there is no politically legitimate model for calculating these costs at European level, which is why I have agreed, after a great deal of discussion and careful thought, to the supplementary model, which provides for contracts to shift transport from the roads to the railways and inland waterways. This is introduced in proposed Amendment No 48 and I call on the House to support it. However, this model should only be allowed for a transitional period because, the best intentions notwithstanding, it contradicts the basic approach of the regulation in targeting equality of competition. Now to notification: aid needs to be notified, but bureaucratic costs should be kept to a minimum. We therefore suggest exemptions for terminals which are provided for in a national or European development plan or which belong to the trans-European freight traffic network. We are also in favour of a de minimis 
rule of EUR 100 000 over three years. As far as aid for the use of transport infrastructure is concerned, we are calling for five-year aid with the possibility of renewal. On balance, the regulation will help to bring about a clearer structure for the granting of aid for the coordination of inland transport and to dismantle distortions of competition – including between Member States.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the important points have already been made, so I can only emphasise them once more, but I am glad to do so. I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Savary, on his report and for succeeding in getting the directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system through the various hoops of the parliamentary system. This was a matter of urgency, because interoperability is a fundamental prerequisite for liberalising international freight traffic, and this is something that we have together got on track, as it were, through the railways package. The problem with conventional rail systems, as compared with high-speed trains, is that the various national systems in Europe are largely incompatible, yet they have involved enormous investment and can only be converted in stages through rebuilding and modification, and this needs to be done whilst still providing a rail service and in the face of continuing competition from other modes of transport. Nevertheless, the convergence process needs to be stepped up for the sake of the railways themselves. The directive, therefore, needs to be implemented as soon as possible. This is also to be welcomed if an internal market is to be created for the supply industry. I hope that rapid progress will be made with the bodies and procedures envisaged for establishing technical specifications and that they will initially concentrate on what can be achieved most quickly, that is to say on train control, safety and signalling equipment. The rapporteur and this House have secured the inclusion of social provisions as well as technical specifications in the directive, and also strategic consideration of the candidate countries when drafting the TSIs. That is positive. As regards safety, I would, of course, have welcomed a more clear-cut vote in favour of independent third-party certification bodies, given that there is still a monopoly situation in some countries and that there are, therefore, conflicts of interest when it comes to certification or rather self-certification. It seems to me that referring to subsidiarity in this context is too simplistic. I am happy to support Mrs Jeggle in this area and I am now pinning my hopes on the railways safety package.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in transport policy we still do not pay intermodal transport the attention it deserves. Hitherto, in fact, only 8% of European freight transport is intermodal, as my colleague just said. That is why this kind of transport is often not taken seriously enough yet. But intermodal goods transport is both the expression and the measure of the European integration strategy, which seeks to integrate not only the individual, national transport markets but also the various transport modes. Following the liberalisation strategy that is not quite completed yet and the harmonisation that has begun, the single market needs this integration strategy if it is to have a viable future. That is why the reports on the progress in implementing the action programme for intermodal transport also reflects the progress made in European transport policy. The communication from the Commission and the report have raised many, indeed all the important issues: the reviews of the trans-European networks aimed at establishing a genuinely intermodal network, measures to create value-added logistical systems, the measures that are still needed to harmonise load units and so forth, genuinely intermodal information, standardised transport messages and documents, the development of a uniform intermodal liability regime and many others. Here, as we all know, we need a whole range of regulatory, political measures to ensure that intermodal transport really has a viable future. Because the framework conditions are so complex and because the development of intermodal transport is still far from being a self-sustaining process, we need a great number of successful pilot projects. So I hope we will get a well-funded new PACT programme, that will be usable by the candidate countries even at this stage, for it is there that many of the decisions are taken that concern our future. The signals are not all set wrong there yet. I also hope that we will give intermodal transport due importance in the Sixth Framework Research Programme. In our view, in future pilot projects should look more at strategic aspects, i.e. at linking up the existing intermodal part-networks. Another aspect that has not really been addressed is this: perhaps we could look into the conditions for creating new European, intermodal operators. For we do not yet have any real operators in this area. Perhaps, theoretically at least, and as a kind of precedent, an international company could manage Alpine transit transport on an intermodal basis. Of course we are also in favour of the European Reference Centre for Intermodalism that keeps being announced and hope it will soon become a reality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the Costa report the discussion about a common framework for levying transport infrastructure charges has got going again. If we want a single market that works, we need a transport system that works, in which the conditions of competition are equal or at least comparable for all those involved in transport. The gradual harmonisation of transport infrastructure charges is the most important step towards that. The way we agree to calculate costs is certainly important to the maintenance, operation and new development of infrastructure whether full costs or marginal costs, social marginal costs or social net costs. But almost more important in terms of equal opportunities in competition is that we reach agreement, and do so as fast as possible. Yet we must remember one thing. If we want to see fair competition between the various transport modes too then we need to go on discussing the implementation of the external costs. To prevent that discussion also means preventing the integration of the various modes of transport and is therefore no more than lobbying, or a policy of lobbying for the status quo. I will fight out the question of who is holding sham debates in this House with Mr Jarzembowski elsewhere; at present I only have two minutes' speaking time. For heavy goods transport we urgently need a Europe-wide, kilometre-based heavy goods charge; here we could also envisage reducing the motor vehicle taxes. Many transport associations are themselves seeing it that way now. Only if we charge transport costs on the "user pays" principle can we obtain a market-compatible instrument to tackle the emerging crisis in goods transport, for we all know about the next leaps in goods transport costs: rising costs as a result of enlargement eastward, of e-commerce, and that is on top of the rates of increase we have seen up to now.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have picked the right moment to discuss enlargement. The fact that there has been a reunited Germany in the European Union for ten years now, bears witness to the solidarity between us. Other countries should now be given the chance to share in this, even though enlargement is not just about solidarity. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism incorporated its position on the Rack report into the Brok report. As a Social Democrat, there are three points I would like to highlight. Firstly, we need a more ambitious transport infrastructure programme for the candidate countries. That is why the Financial Perspective does not appear to us to go far enough, because there is a huge disparity between the diagnosed infrastructure requirements and the financing instruments made available by the Union, together with the candidate countries’ own means, and it will only be possible to implement public private partnership financing models to a limited extent. However, it is politically unacceptable for there to be development periods in excess of 50 years. Secondly, the transeuropean corridors are defined intermodally. We should make a virtue out of something that was born of necessity; i.e. there was a need to localise major trends in goods and passenger movements. In other words, we should keep the integration of modes of transport in mind right from the start. In addition the traditionally robust sector of goods transport by rail should receive the most support. In this way, we might avoid having to implement as many regeneration measures at a later stage, as we are having to do in our own countries now. Thirdly, we want transitional periods for goods transport by road, which will enable there to be a gradual opening up. They could even start in the pre-accession period. It is in the interests of both sides to achieve economic and social balance during integration of the transport markets, because we are already waiting with bated breath as to the consequences of distorted competition on our roads.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked: why are we so keen on short sea shipping at European level? The answer is: we have a vision. We see large quantities of goods transported round our continent on safe, environmentally-friendly ships. The goods are unloaded at the point where they can reach their destination via the shortest possible overland route. That takes the burden off overland transport by adding another link to the chain of intermodal transport. Of course we are still many sea miles away from making this vision come true, although some progress has been made over the past two years, as the report shows. Mrs Peijs’ good report describes the existing obstacles and the strategies for realising our visions. There was broad agreement in committee. What can we do internally for short sea shipping? I just want to mention a few things. In the technical field we can introduce more environmentally-friendly technology for ships’ engines and specific terminals for express transhipment. In the organisational field, and especially for cross-frontier transport, we can introduce uniform shipping documentation, simplified administrative procedures and fewer pilot services in cases where they are not absolutely necessary. What can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain? First, we can improve the interfaces with other modes of transport by introducing modern systems of transhipment – especially to inland shipping – standardising containers, promoting transport logistics services for the entire transport chain and by many other means mentioned in the report. I think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre-accession strategies. Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables. The report says that an exchange of best practice would be useful. That is true, for why have we been calling for some time now for a reference centre for intermodal transport. It would be sensible to engage in more research and above all to set up demonstration projects in the field of intermodal transport. All in all the report offers a whole package of sensible proposals. I hope that the next progress report in two years’ time will tell us that we have moved a little closer to our vision, our vision of a successful intermodal transport system in Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if economic and social cohesion is rightly called the core of European policy, then it is safe to say that the Structural Funds act as its pacemaker. We are talking today about the functioning of a political instrument which we have since, with Agenda 2000, replaced with a new and we hope better one. Nevertheless, it is the duty and the right of this Parliament to review the Structural Funds by means of their annual reports and to derive political requirements from those reports, even if they appear to have been overtaken by events. We believe that the rapporteur, Mr Turco, has done an excellent job on both counts in his report on the 10th Annual Report on the Structural Funds, 1998. The many amendments made by Members of this House have substantially enhanced the report. I do not want to repeat here those criticisms which have been recorded and can be checked in writing. Mr Turco and others Members have already reiterated these criticisms. However, I would like to strengthen one demand, and that is the demand that in its next report the Commission should devote a special section to reporting on the measures which it has adopted in response to criticisms voiced by Parliament in previous years. The 11th Annual Report should, therefore, at the same time include a progress report.  Because time is short, I only want to address four problems and approaches which we think point to the way forward. Firstly, the period covered by the report, 1998, was notable for the fact that it was only possible to achieve total implementation of appropriations for the entire programming period by means of last-minute measures. Experience has shown that we need special strategies for the initial and concluding stages of programming periods and a flexibility mechanism for crisis situations like those which arose in 1997/98. Secondly, the principle of additionality is one of the main pillars of our structural policy, and I do not want to undermine it. Nevertheless, there is a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality. For example, in the case of Objective 1 areas, it is frequently only partly true to say that there is an independent structural policy to which the European component is added. This is often because all the funding available in political terms has already had to be committed to guarantee adequate cofinancing, and rightly so. However, when it comes to the principle of additionality, this means, if I may resort to a metaphor, that it is like me being given a suit by Europe to complement a tie that I can afford myself at regional level. The forthcoming enlargement will add to this problem. So as I see it, we need a new definition of additionality. This might perhaps be something along the lines of additional European added value, which is already a prerequisite for the framework research programmes and for the Community INTERREG initiative, for example. Thirdly, we believe that the principle of partnership with local and regional authorities and with the two sides of industry is heading in the right direction and should be further strengthened. We need both more local initiatives and pacts and a regional debate about priorities for a given region. In this way our structural policy itself will contribute to regionalisation. Structural policy simultaneously reacts to and creates regional structures. Fourthly, controls and assessments are the alpha and omega of any structural policy that has the noble objective of making itself superfluous as quickly as possible. Even if there are marked structural differences between regions, this should not stop us from looking for common evaluation methods and indicators. Only in this way can we make horizontal comparisons between strategies and projects between Member States in individual areas of activity. The previous speaker mentioned this problem. Benchmarking should also be possible in this policy area soon.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the Sapard report in this related debate, I would like to say a few words about the enlargement negotiations. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wholeheartedly supports the Commission's line in the agriculture negotiations with the accession candidates. We call upon the Council and especially some Member States to give their support to the course adopted by the Commission on agriculture. As many of you are aware, I have been a fervent supporter of reform in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for many years. I will carry on being one in future, and we are looking forward to the Commission's communication on this issue with great excitement. However, one thing must be clear: the reform debate must not interfere with the negotiations. No premature conditions must be set at this stage which might delay the accession negotiations. Conversely, of course, the accession negotiations and the accession candidate countries' demands which understandably arise must not be allowed to impede the reform debate. The two must run in parallel, but must not block each other. We feel that this is a very important point. Naturally, there is conflict: some Member States are not in favour of any direct payments, while the recipient countries would like to receive 100% – and let me say to the candidate countries that they will yet again have cause to be grateful to the Commission for its proposals. On the issue of Sapard: while we spend our time arguing in the accession negotiations about the level of payments, we are failing to exploit the opportunities for pre-accession assistance that Sapard offers. We are pushing substantial amounts of money around as if we were a snow plough. Of course, there are reasons for this. I am not trying to apportion blame, but it is important to analyse the causes clearly and decide what else we can do. Of course, the decentralised management of the programme which we have opted for is a very demanding method of management. I am sure that money would have been paid out to projects much more quickly if we had had a centralised administration with management by the Commission. For sound and well-intentioned reasons, things were done differently. However, we must accept that we should have foreseen that these generous arrangements involving a decentralised structure and increased individual responsibility on the part of the accession countries were unlikely to achieve the rapid outcomes which were desired. We hope that there will be a major step forward this year. Unfortunately, however, we cannot make up for lost time. This is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recommended to the Commission last year that since we have opted to manage the programme in this way so that it involves a learning process which will ultimately be of benefit to the candidate countries after accession, why not implement other elements of rural development which we have tried and tested in a European Union with fifteen Member States? Why not include a Leader-type programme, which we have christened INPARD? Now, of course, this proposal by the committee is being dismissed by the Commission, which tells us that we have run out of time and that we do not have the right legal framework. The Commission often uses these arguments when it does not want to adopt a particular measure! It may well be the case that if we now motivate the organisations and local populations by offering them a Leader-type programme and encourage them to develop their own ideas creatively in rural areas, things will not really get off the ground until they are full members. Nonetheless, we would win some time if we try to involve them pro-actively in this way. What is more, this type of programme might give us an opportunity to channel all the money that has been lost – not down the Swannee, I would not say that – back into the Finance Ministers' coffers. We are not happy with the situation, none of us, we know that. The Commission is not happy either since the Sapard funds have not been used in the way we wanted. Nonetheless, let us at least put on a spurt over the final metres so that we can see something for our efforts, and so that all the Member States – and there are differences between the accession countries in this Sapard programme – so that they experience the EU and so that the money which is urgently needed for reforesting around agriculture, and for slaughter-houses and dairies etc. can genuinely help them to attain the quality needed to make their products marketable in Europe. We must also make it clear to the accession countries that it is not only a matter of quality: once they have full membership, they must supply the EU market. We cannot make distinctions in terms of the quality of agricultural products depending on whether they are destined for the EU's internal market or for export. The excuse used by some candidate countries – that we should not get excited about it because they are not exporting to the EU at present, and are actually buying products in Ukraine and Russia – will no longer be relevant. We cannot accept it. This is why money and prompt assistance are needed. Money now being spent on Sapard and other programmes in the accession countries will save us money later when these countries are full members. Let us try and make the best of it! (Applause)

I voted in favour of the report of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and thus against this Commission proposal, because the latter far exceeds the targets set for the Commission in July 2000 by the Agricultural Council. Rather than presenting a simple and straightforward regulatory framework for the supervision of the EU alcohol market and of trade patterns, the actual Commission proposal provides for the creation of a new Common Organisation of the Market. This, among other things, includes the provision that, after its entry into force, tried and tested national regulatory arrangements on objectives of importance to agricultural and social policy, such as care for the cultural landscape and the maintenance of meadows of indigenous dehiscent fruit, but not supporting small agricultural distilleries, would have to be repealed on the grounds of incompatibility with the competition 
rules of the Treaty establishing the European Community, even though they have, to date, been declared by the ECJ to be compatible with the Treaty establishing the European Community and with current Internal Market rules. The creation of a new COM is also to be rejected at a time when there is general discussion about reforming the common agricultural policy away from market regulation and in the direction of a multifunctional approach for the future, and Agenda 2000 is about to be reviewed. I therefore call on the Commission to withdraw its proposal for the creation of a COM in agricultural alcohol and submit a new proposal closely adhering to the Council mandate of July 2000.

Mr President, my warm thanks to Mr Costa Neves, Mr Wynn and all the members of Parliament's team in the conciliation negotiations. There was nothing else to be done. The Commission's amending letter being as modest as it was, one could hardly build up anything great on it. As we know how little room there is for change when it comes to compulsory expenditure in the agricultural sector, I think we have to give you credit for having fought and won a few points. I would like to single out one point, one, which makes very clear the dilemma as regards the agricultural budget. We all know that our hands are more or less tied when it comes to compulsory expenditure, that they are tied, too, when it comes to outlining compulsory expenditure and thus outlining the common agricultural policy. Where we could make headway – the second pillar, which is a no more substantial beanstalk than it was before, where we have more obligations than we can meet – we are unable to transfer funds from the compulsory expenditure. Our self-imposed captivity must at some point come to an end. Not for the first time, I claim for Parliament not only the unhindered right to set a Budget, but also I claim for it the full right of co-decision in the area of the common agricultural policy. If these rights are not granted to us, then this dilemma will remain unresolved. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Agriculture Committee wishes to address the Council and express its fundamental opposition to the cuts across the board that the Council is always making. We see this, in political terms, as a rather unimaginative way of handling Budget guidelines. We are working on the assumption that the letter of amendment will be the right basis on which to adjust individual areas in preparation for second reading. Apart from that, we hold to our demand for agricultural expenditure to be made more flexible in future by enabling the transfer of funds from the mandatory to the discretionary division. We know how complicated that is and how many changes have to be made, but we will carry on demanding this whenever budgets are laid before us, until our demands have been met. The Commission's proposal on the introduction of a reserve meets with our explicit support. That is needed. We are sure that we do not have to explain why it is necessary. We also assume that the Commission will act responsibly if it becomes necessary to make use of it. Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have just spoken about tobacco. We too on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to return to the tobacco issue. We are most dissatisfied with the inadequate use being made of money from the Tobacco Research Fund. On the Agriculture Committee, we, too, are fed up with forever flogging a dead horse where this subject is concerned. We have, on the one hand, the demand for preventative health education, and, on the other, the need to promote tobacco growing. We must, though, face reality. For as long as we have farmers who grow tobacco – and they are not the richest – and have no alternative crop to offer them, we cannot help them. This sector therefore needs possible alternatives not only to be examined, but also offered. Most of all, I would like to say something more about SAPARD: we are glad that the appropriations have been increased, but, like the Commissioner, we are critical of the way the Council has cut by EUR 100 million the amount of funds SAPARD is authorised to pay out. This is not on! It is absolutely not on! Please, Commissioner, let there be no fear of a new implementation along the lines of LEADER. Take your courage in both hands! Let me take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur for working so well with me and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the main rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, you could be forgiven for thinking that this year's budget procedure chiefly consisted of considering the agriculture budget. I am indeed grateful to him for emphasising the agricultural side, but in concrete terms this would mean – and this is something we welcome – that the 2002 budget would be taking the first steps towards the required reform of EU agricultural policy. However, these steps would be somewhat less incisive because the 2002 budget will probably be very much marked by the need to overcome the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises. On behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would therefore suggest that we take the issues before us particularly seriously, and that we therefore ensure that provision is made for the possibility of bringing together appropriations – including those in the area of compulsory expenditure – in the form of a fund for "animal diseases and market emergencies". This would guarantee that we really have sufficient funds to deal with the crisis, which has assumed catastrophic proportions, in conjunction with the Member States. On no account will we accept an attempt to tackle problems by means of across-the-board cuts, as was discussed for the previous budget. We trust that there will not be a request of this kind from the Commission when the preliminary draft budget for 2002 is submitted. In the context of export refunds and of a new EU agricultural authority, which is now on the cards, we should also try to continue the trend of further reducing expenditure in respect of exports, where it is still very high. This would not only make it easier for us to energetically defend our position at WTO level, but would also increase our overall flexibility as regards agriculture and rural development. In other words, despite all the problems that the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises are currently creating for us, we would like to see Commission's preliminary draft budget containing the first positive steps towards the much-needed reform of EU agricultural policy.
Görlach (PSE

 Mr President, as the European Union has also helped to create this crisis the European Union must therefore play its part in managing the crisis. But when I say 'the European Union', I do not mean the Commission or the Council or Parliament but I am essentially referring to our Member States as well, which make up the EU. Please do not misunderstand me: no one can point the finger at anyone else and pretend that he himself has had nothing to do with this whole sorry affair. The European agricultural policy in its current form, with all its weaknesses and errors, was created and shaped by all the Member States and parties of all political hues. So we must all join together to change it. That does not alter the fact that at present, we face a situation in which we have to manage the crisis on the old playing field in line with the old rules. We cannot ignore this fact. As yet, we have no new rules and we have no reformed agricultural policy, although that is what we are calling for. Of course, Mr Ferber is right when he distinguishes between short, medium and long-term issues. That is quite correct. But anyone who is now asked for funding and support for the expenditure necessary to manage the crisis has not only a right but also a duty to call for the much-needed reforms. We have a programme which runs until 2006, with a review in 2002. But we already know that the review will reveal that there is a need for a fundamental reform of the agricultural policy. So our vote in favour of this supplementary budget is a vote coupled with a clear statement. And we will remind you of that very soon.

Mr President, honourable members, we all know that the agricultural sector is one of the most difficult sectors when it comes to enlargement. But there is no point in running scared; the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development takes the view that, if we estimate pre-accession aid correctly, we can do it. However, we must be clear about a number of things: structures in candidate countries vary considerably; in fact they could not vary more, which is why everything we do must be geared to the structures which currently exist in the individual Member States. In the import-export sector, only Hungary has a positive balance of agricultural trade with the EU-15 at present. All the others import more agricultural goods into their countries than they export to the Union. That should give us food for thought, because so many of our farmers are afraid that, if we unify, we shall all go under because they are all fully paid-up agricultural economies. That is not the case. The dangers lie elsewhere altogether. We in the Committee on Agriculture are firmly convinced that we should give these countries as much as we can from SAPARD resources and that we should give it to the right agencies. We need to restock structures in the positive sense, from abattoirs and dairies to processing. It makes no sense to import pig carcasses into the EU-15, create the added value here and then send the finished products back to the shops in these countries. That way they will never be able to stand on their own two feet. Everything we do to start this process now will save money later. We must also clarify openly and honestly in discussions with these countries, that the common agricultural policy does not imply that the same payments have to be made everywhere from day one of membership, without checking if there are price losses in the individual product segments. That would be unfair to other structures in the EU-15. This can be reasonably regulated with reasonable phasing-in. Then, of course, there is the problem of transitional arrangements. In the veterinary sector, in the phytosanitary sector, these countries need transitional periods of 10, 12 or even 15 years. Obviously that is out of the question. And because it is out of the question, it is important to do what we can now so that any unavoidable transitional arrangements needed can be as short as possible. It is better to introduce measures now than to start a long fight five minutes before accession. All these purely agricultural matters should not obscure the fact that the following applies in the agricultural sector: Unless institutional reforms are properly regulated before the first candidate countries accede to the EU, there will be much that we are unable to regulate as we would like to. Of course, no-one will be surprised to learn that the Committee on Agriculture takes the view that the important area of the agricultural economy, which continues to account for almost half the budget – and this will basically remain the case –, should come under the codecision procedure. I have been instructed by our whole committee to express this view emphatically for the attention of all the agricultural ministers in the Member States, irrespective of which political hat they wear, because that is where those that are holding back and oppose this are to be found. The future Member States, our candidate countries, are joining a changing common agricultural policy and it would be a poor show of parliamentary democracy in practice if they continued to be excluded from the democratic process of shaping the future common agricultural policy in an area which is far more important to them than it is for most of the fully paid-up Fifteen. That is a most important point. And I have something else to say: we need to say this loud and clear to our member governments, especially our agricultural ministers, in the first phase of the Intergovernmental Conference. We shall have a fight on our hands in some areas; we already have. It is a question of money. The assumption is that we did not want to grant them the same blessings of the common agricultural policy in euros. That is wrong. But justice does not mean that everything is measured with the same yardstick. It means that every candidate country will receive aid, according to its needs, which puts it on an equal footing with the Fifteen. And that does not mean that the same numerical sums must be paid per hectare, per tonne or per head. That is not necessary and would create injustices. On balance then, we have nothing to fear, but we must reform, otherwise accession will not work in the agricultural sector.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+. One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned. I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept. There is a problem, however, which we need to address together. Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were. And because of the programme’s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER. That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas. Of course this is also the basic idea. It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities. Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work. My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted. There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy. Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far. At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic. And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well. That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!

Mr President, if we have understood the President-in-Office of the Council correctly, then this message, that the Council is moving towards Parliament’s position, is an important one. After the events of the last few weeks, I am pleased to hear the message but I lack faith. Which is why we need an exact overview of what this message in fact means. Parliament has taken great pains to move towards the Council’s position over recent weeks. Until the end, any such effort on the part of the Council was minimal. And if there is any now, we must ask, why not a moment earlier because, if the situation really is as we have understood it – and I still have my doubts – then we now have problems with how, technically, we are supposed to ensure that everything goes according to plan. Until that has been clarified, as far as I am concerned, the decision of the Committee on Budgets taken yesterday evening still stands.

 Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to thank the coordinators of all Groups in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that this compromise has been achieved. I must acknowledge the generous nature of the general rapporteur, who was himself of another opinion. That is understandable, and I also know that the Committee chairman was in favour of another view, but we should pay tribute to the hard work of all the representatives of the Committee on Budgets here. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this view.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, relations between the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets were always tense during preliminary work on the budget. That is clear and, given that the greater part of the budget falls within the agricultural sector, it was only to be expected. Which is why it is particularly pleasing that, on this occasion, we can state that cooperation has been a whole lot better than in the past. This is in no small measure owing to the committee chairpersons and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, but also, it should be added, to senior members of all groups. Nevertheless, not all the wishes of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would manage a majority today; we know that. All the same, we place particular importance on not accepting the Council proposals for across-the-board cuts and, above all, on providing for a moderate increase in veterinary and plant health expenditure and in sales promotion. Veterinary and plant health expenditure is not just agricultural expenditure, but also expenditure in terms of sensible, forward-looking consumer protection. The new second pillar in the matter of rural development is, of course, a special concern of the Committee. Here we simply cannot understand the reservation of the Council. We are pleased that, in its letter of amendment, the Commission opposes Parliament’s position. The multifunctional tasks of agriculture relating to food, maintaining the countryside, nature conservation and tourism as a job sector of the future which will expand rather than diminish are a major concern for the whole Parliament. The Council really must accept that, in future, changes will be made to agricultural sector expenditure across the individual blocks of which it is made up. But that must not lead to us pursuing the cheap option and imagining that we can simply free up money for other policy areas by making across-the-board cuts in the agricultural sector, which not only covers expenditure on farmers but also that on all rural matters. It should be noted that recent years have seen a convergence of Parliament and the Commission in this sector. The previous lack of vision on the part of the Council must give way to a more realistic approach, not least with a view to what the future holds for us in terms of the powers of Parliament, also where the budget is concerned.

 Mr President, learning from a catastrophe means facing the future. All the laws or directives that we pass here are, at the end of the day, worth nothing if they cannot be monitored and enforced. For this reason, we need very rapidly in the medium term a European coast guard service, not least in view of the new and emerging risk of terrorism. We cannot sit and wait until terrorists attack vessels in European waters, but rather we must counter them in good time through a coast guard service. My second point is that the Baltic is a sensitive maritime area. As a committee, we called for obligatory pilots in the Baltic, but we are aware that this cannot be achieved without Russia. For this reason, we ask you, Commissioner, to combine with the Commission and the Council in putting political pressure on Russia to ensure that Russia also at last complies with the international regulations in the IMO. My third and final point is that we are aware that 80% of all accidents at sea are attributable to human error. Hitherto, we have devoted great attention to technology. In the future, we must concentrate more on the human factor, which means that we must direct our attention more specifically to the training of captains, officers and crew in accident management, fire protection and emergency measures.

 Mr President, it would of course make for enormous fun if I were now to talk about the dispute among the Conservatives, but, as Mr Bradbourn has submitted a good report, I shall refrain from doing so. I think we should start by stressing what a fascinating European transport project the trans-European networks are. Jobs are at stake, as is the transport of goods, and this is also of course about how this can be done without damaging the environment. The Commission proposal is very consistent, in that it makes clear Europe’s desire to change over to environmentally-friendly modes of transport and to water-based ones. With the motorways of the sea, we are breaking new ground, and European transport policy can hold its head up there. It has to be said, though, that railway projects and waterways have effects in terms of environmental policy, and so, as part of the trans-European networks, there is a need for strategic environmental assessment. If codecision means anything at all, it means that there have to be changes in the way specific projects are developed. If there are plans for motorways of the sea between the North Sea and the Baltic – and I think they would be a good thing – whilst the canal between the North Sea and the Baltic, which would cut the journey significantly, is forgotten, then that is not on; it would be absurd. For that reason, there is a need for improvements here. I think we need to tell the Council that we, in this Parliament, have had experience of the development of the trans-European networks; let me just mention the Christophersen Group or the Essen projects. That is why it cannot be surprising that this House should attach importance to the realisation – and hence also the funding – of the trans-European networks and the priority projects being subject to strict controls and rigorous monitoring. That I see as one of our tasks as a parliament. If the Council wants solutions – and I think it capable of getting them – then fair compromises are needed, and they have to be agreed by us together; the Council cannot simply announce a done deal. If it makes good use of the opportunity, we can achieve the right results.

 Mr President, instead of always focusing our attention on shipping disasters and their consequences, I think we should do more about what I have to call the day-to-day fouling of the oceans. So, Commissioner, I warmly congratulate you on this proposal. I think it is a good proposal, and would also like to congratulate Mr Pex – who is unfortunately absent – on his fine report. We absolutely must do something about this. In 2001 alone, there were some thousand instances of illegal discharges into the North Sea and the Baltic, and this must no longer be regarded as a trivial offence and treated as such; it is not like wrongful parking or breaking the speed limit, and must at last be punished as a criminal offence under the criminal law – which means tough and painful penalties, such as fines, imprisonment, and, as the committee has requested, the seizure of vessels. The rapporteur was right to point out that several laws adopted by Parliament and the Council have not yet been implemented. They have to do with port reception facilities and port state control. If, Commissioner, you want to bring before the ECJ those states that have not properly transposed this directive, in order to bring this out into the open and thus to bring pressure to bear in order to get this directive transposed at last, then this House is behind you all the way. Even the best laws are ineffective unless they are enforced and monitored. For that we need a European coastguard, something else on which there is consensus in this House, for control in the ports is one thing, but it must be accompanied by control on the high seas. We have got used to the idea that it is quite normal to monitor lorries not only in yards, but also on the roads. In future, that must also be possible at sea. You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Council regards that as too ambitious. Such arguments must not be given a hearing. I believe that we must not encourage the Council’s tendency to hide behind formalities, but should compel it to act. If Europe comes together and acts in unison, then we will make progress in sea travel and maritime safety on an international basis too. What matters is that we do everything not only to avoid disasters, but also to put an end to the toleration of deliberate, malicious and criminal acts in our waters. We can do something about them. We back you in doing so and are right behind you in your endeavour to publicly stigmatise the governments that do not do likewise.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one can have the same goals, Commissioner, whilst nevertheless pursuing them by different means. German ports, at any rate, are currently enjoying impressive growth, and doing so without this directive. Things can evidently go the other way. This week, this House has had the great opportunity to make it clear that, far from us being the Council’s agent, our primary obligation is to people, citizens and workers. Let me remind you: at second reading stage, all of us in this House, by very, very large majorities, joined together in calling for three important things: we wanted the ports’ financial relations to be made transparent and put on a regulated footing, and that has, in part, been achieved. We wanted pilotage services in shipping not to be just any port service like tugboats or mooring, subject to the prevalent great economic pressure that there is in ports, and not to be subject to competition but committed to safety. Being a special public task, pilotage services do not belong in this directive, but we have not managed to keep them out of it. One very important point is that we wanted self-handling to be restricted to the ship and its crew, but with discretionary approval and with decent conditions in terms of social security and labour law. Let me quote once again: ‘Self-handlers shall be treated in the same way as other port service providers. To this end, self-handlers must adhere to the same standards of social protection and possess the same vocational qualifications as other service providers in the same, or a similar, port system.’ That is what the Council rejected; that is what we failed to achieve. We cannot, then, describe this as a fair compromise; it is more like kow-towing to the Council. If, then, you want the pilots, who guide ships safely into our ports, to continue to have obligations in terms of safety and the environment, then you have to reject what has come out of this conciliation procedure. If you want to deny social dumping a foothold in our ports, and want instead to enable qualified workers to operate under good social conditions; if you want social harmony to be maintained in our ports, then you have to reject this directive. I am all in favour of looking at these compromises to see if the glass is half full or half empty, but, in this instance, the glass is not half-full of water; it contains just a few drops for Parliament, and I can tell the Council that it cannot be in Parliament’s interest to start by taking up a firm position and then being satisfied with little. This is not just about the matter in hand, but also, in this instance, about our conception of our parliamentary function. That is why I strongly urge – as does my group – that we reject the whole thing. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not, of course, have to re-invent the trans-European networks, because we have them already. Mind you, they have already lost something of their impetus, considering who has been working on them and for how long. From 1996 until today, the TENs have undoubtedly had their ups and downs. At the beginning, or as early as at the Essen Council, they were hailed as the magic remedy for the European Union and its development, until the moment came when we realised that what was expected of them was rather unrealistic. No, I think that the TENs are a very important tool for the European Union, economic cohesion, the internal market and a modern transport policy. The Commission’s White Paper again made that clear not long ago. As Europeans, we need a transport policy that is technically up-to-date – GALILEO was mentioned as a potential model – and one that is sustainable, that is to say with priority given to rail and water. We should now have been a small step further down the road if the Council had also accepted the Commission’s proposals, as Parliament has done. In 2002, Parliament attempted a small revision of the trans-European networks, to which the Council has not so far provided us with a response; instead, the Van Miert Group has gone on to do its work. So then, we do not have to re-invent the wheel. The Van Miert Group has done its work, involving high-ranking representatives from every single Member State, and its reports affirm that the Member States agree with what it has, as it were, thought out and presented. It is now, therefore, really up to the Commission to incorporate what the Van Miert Group suggested into a proposal. This would then go before Parliament and the Council and, given good will on the part of the Council, we should then have implemented relatively quickly what the Van Miert Group has thought out in terms of projects and, also, financing instruments. It is not quite clear to me why, in fact, we are now debating the issue once again. The proposals and plans are on the table. It is now just a question of their being implemented and worked on. That is why no further pressure should be placed upon available speaking time. So then, we have a proposal from the Commission, Parliament is doing its work, and then let the Council – instead of dragging its heels, if it please – very rapidly implements the proposal so that the revision of the TENs can be got rapidly under way. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let me start by warmly congratulating Mr Sterckx, the author of this report; it is outstanding, it is superb, and I would almost be prepared to accord to it the status of holy writ as regards the safety of ships and maritime transport in the future – provided, of course, that it includes those things for which we are pushing, as it is very comprehensive. We were told, let me remind you, that the Prestige
 had set off from the Baltic, and that – leaving Austria and Luxembourg out – it had, at least in theory passed by every one of the Member States, so that what happened could have happened anywhere. This means that we need not just technical improvements but also safer shipping lanes. We have been told more than once about the blackspots in the Baltic, such as, for example, the ‘Kadetrinne’, where what basically happens is that ships end up travelling in the wrong direction, so that near-accidents are an almost daily occurrence. That is why there is an urgent need for mandatory pilotage there, and that is something we want to bring up in this House. It is the Russians who are refusing to accept this, so I would like to see us in this House make explicit reference to it when we vote, and put more pressure on Russia in this matter, as mandatory pilotage is inordinately important. My second point is that there of course have to be emergency measures, with clear responsibilities and adequate provision of tugboats. Perhaps Commissioner De Palacio will again give some thought to what was said at the first meeting about the issue of linking this with compensation, as this may simplify the practical side of any emergency measures. Quite apart from the disasters, we must not forget the mess that is made in European coastal waters on a daily basis. In 2001, 390 oil slicks were illegally deposited in the Baltic, with another 596 in the North Sea. Commissioner, I think it right and proper that you have put something forward about once and for all categorising this as criminal wrongdoing and dealing with it by means of criminal law. Fines are not enough to deal with this; no longer must it be possible to pay them out of the petty cash. Such pollution of the sea is a crime, and must be punished accordingly. Technology, though, is not the decisive factor. I very much welcomed your commencement, in July, of proceedings in respect of infringements of the Treaties against ten Member States that have not yet transposed even the measures decided on after Erika
. It is, basically, sad that this should be so. Those ten Member States should be ashamed of themselves, and the country holding the presidency being one of them is a bitter pill to swallow. We need port State control and classification societies. The Member States did not need the accident that befell the Prestige
 to make that clear to them. That was what we decided post-Erika
, and you yourselves all signed up to it. I think, Commissioner, that you will have every support from Parliament in these matters – on which both Parliament and the Council have come to decisions – in pressing for this to be transposed into national law, failing which this whole Council will remain a bunch of hypocrites, and we will be unable to make any promises to the public about safety.

 Mr President, this report is about the phasing out as quickly as possible of old oil tankers, which have been responsible, for example, for the Prestige 
disaster. We have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission that what the committee has agreed is also a common decision, and that we can complete the first reading today. I therefore urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the committee's proposals; otherwise we will put the timetable at risk. If we can complete the first reading, this regulation would come into force in the summer, allowing us to achieve a major improvement in maritime safety in our European waters. Amendments Nos 33 and 34 have been withdrawn by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, and I therefore hope that other Members will only wish to vote on the committee's amendments.
Piecyk (PSE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on this report this week, we will, I believe, have achieved in record time something that the people of Europe and the public at large have been awaiting with urgency. It is, after all, self-evident that, after the accidents involving the Prestige
 and the Erika, 
something had to happen. When it comes to transporting oil, we are giving old, unsafe, and dangerous ships no more chances. At the same time, Parliament and the Council are directing that bulk shipments may now be transported from and into EU ports only in double hull tankers. By combining these factors, which I see as the most important – heavy oil into and out of European ports from now on only in double hull tankers – and by significantly speeding up the scrapping of the old single hull tankers, we are making the sea and European waters safer to a substantial degree. Only a few months have elapsed between the Commission’s initiative and the first reading here in Parliament, and this first reading will also be the last, as that is what has been agreed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, who have, so to speak, taken a united approach. For that reason I would like to extend very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for playing their part in this process, as well as to the Greek Presidency, which – as Commissioner De Palacio has already mentioned – has gone to a great deal of trouble, and also to the Commission, for doing such a good job of bringing the Council and Parliament together so promptly to do this. This fast-track procedure was possible because the political will to find a consensus was there and – for we have to be honest – because the Prestige 
disaster made the need for action even more pressing. Let me just make the following points about the preferred timescale for scrapping. Single hull tankers in category 1, that is, ships built before 1982, may not be operated for longer than 23 years and must be taken out of service by 2005 at the latest. Single hull tankers in categories 2 and 3, built between 1982 and 1996, may be operated until 2010 at the latest. In this, the Council and Parliament have gone even further than the Commission, but I think that there is justification for putting categories 2 and 3 together, as there is no difference between them apart from their tonnages. Small tankers between 600 and 5 000 tonnes are rightly included as regards the carrying of heavy oil, and here too we have reached a compromise, as, in view of their small number and in order to maintain supplies, we have agreed on 2008, which means that, from that date onwards, only small double hull tankers will be able to be used to transport heavy oil. In this connection I would like to emphasise the international dimension. We know, of course, that shipping is international, and that European rules on their own cannot cover everything. Without European rules, though, we would make no real headway through the International Maritime Organisation, which is very heavy going, and so it is a good thing that the IMO is holding a conference on this subject at the end of this year, at which the Commission and the Council will attempt to have European rules made applicable internationally, in doing which they have Parliament’s full support. It is also, of course, the case that double hull tankers on their own are not the safety factor on which everything depends. Other safety factors include port State control, the way in which a ship is maintained, a well-trained crew, and good navigation, often also with the help of pilots in difficult waters. The oil industry’s argument, as set out in the 'Neue Zürcher Zeitung', that a well-maintained old single hull tanker with a good crew could be much safer than a sloppily-maintained double hull tanker with a sub-standard crew, may well have some truth to it, but it is hypocritical and somewhat stupid. Nobody, after all, asserts that a fifty-year old car is worse than a brand-new Rolls-Royce whose brakes work and whose driver doesn’t fall asleep. For the oil industry to adduce such an argument is pretty dubious. We, on the contrary, agree that it is a combination of diverse factors that makes a ship safer. Let me address a couple more aspects. A Chinese freighter has sunk off the Swedish coast, and oil is leaking from it – 400 tonnes of it so far. That is why we will, in future, also need rules covering how fuel and engine oil are to be made safer even on double hull tankers. Old ships are to be taken out of service, and must be safely disposed of. If that is to be done in an environmentally friendly way, that cannot mean scuppering them somewhere in the South Seas. My final point is that Europe has a particular need for new and better ships, which – in view of the dumping that demonstrably goes on – must, for God’s sake, not all be built in Korea. Whilst this is not a discussion about subsidies, the Commission and the Council do need to come up with imaginative initiatives on this, for the building of better ships in European shipyards certainly makes more economic sense than what happened on the coast of Galicia. (Applause)

 Mr President, the committee agreed overwhelmingly on the need to restrict self-handling to ships' crew. Now, though, we have the problem that these expressions are used very differently in the various translations, not only the German, but also the English and French versions. As I see it, knowing that the basis must be the German text, the most correct and tidy translation is the English one, which refers to ‘regular seafaring crew’, enabling Parliament to make it abundantly clear that we are not talking about what is done on land, but only about what can be done by the ship's crew, using their own equipment, and nothing more. That is why I would like this made clear by the language used in the translations. ‘Seafaring crew’ and ‘Schiffsbesatzung
’ would have the additional advantage over the expression used in the German version, in that ‘seemännische’ in German still has a very masculine ring to it, whilst ‘Schiffsbesatzung
’ and ‘seafaring crew’ could be said to be gender-neutral, which would have an advantage in terms of gender mainstreaming. (Loud applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think it right that, in what you had to say, you quite unequivocally faced the issue head-on, but you should be aware that the committee's amendments, about which you made critical comments, are the result of large majorities in the committee, for which I want to express my gratitude to Mr Jarzembowski. We passed them with a great deal of unanimity, and I think we will get an absolute majority of 314 votes on the decisive points when we vote tomorrow. Discussing the part package today and voting on it tomorrow, we know that many European port cities – and I emphasise cities – have seen their workers, out of fear for their jobs, out of fear of social dumping, taking to the streets and demonstrating, and I say, for myself and on behalf of my group, that we sympathise with port workers as they draw attention to their concerns and needs. They have every right to do so, but not, as I see it, to throw stones and get into scuffles with the police. I take the demonstrations in the port cities to be in support of the work we are doing, as the Common Position does indeed include a number of odious points that we cannot accept; it is those things in the Common Position that we want to change today and tomorrow. The most odious point is the formulation on self-handling, which is also to include what is done on land. Let me say quite clearly that this is, in our view, unacceptable. We take the view that self-handling can mean only those things that can be done by a ship and its company on their own. Anything more than that is not on, as is clear from the term ‘self-handling’ itself; anything else would be handling by others. Let me say, for the benefit of the Commission and the Council, that we Social Democrats do not believe this definition of self-handling to be capable of being negotiated in a conciliation procedure. There is no moving beyond that, either here or in the conciliation procedure. I want to point out that the directive contains an array of provisions that touch – to the workers' benefit – on social protection, social security matters, and their qualifications for the jobs they do. I think the committee has done very good work on these things, and the Social Democrats have tabled amendments to make overall improvements. You can vote in favour of all these amendments tomorrow, and then everything will be that little bit better for the workers. Finally, I turn to the issue of pilot services, an area in which the Commission was very keen – and the Council rather less keen – to see competition introduced. We believe this to be wrong. As carriers, ships are subject to so many constraints, and face so much competition, that safety often gets left behind. As we have seen from what happened to the Prestige
 and the Erika
, pilots have to answer for the safety of ships. They therefore have nothing to do with this directive. In general – as Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned – we have now devoted a great deal of attention to competition in ports. My main problem continues to be with competition between one port and another, and that is where the Commission has not done enough. We hope the Commission will now present us with something good in this area, so that we can really get to grips with the problem of inter-port competition.

 Mr President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work and also for his efforts to reconcile diverse positions, about which we have heard today. I think that the White Paper gives European transport policy a great opportunity to draw the right conclusions from the ruthless analysis that it contains. This must not be to do nothing; we cannot hide our heads in the sand, as this might well make a transport policy meltdown inevitable. The analysis is harsh and cruel and, Mrs Peijs, we have to take it on board: every day there are 7 500 km of traffic jams on Europe's roads; between 1990 and 1998, CO2 emissions increased by 15%; the amount of freight transported by rail has declined in recent years from 21% to 8.5% and between 1990 and 1996 alone, ten football fields' worth of new motorways were constructed every day. We simply cannot go on like this and a sea change in transport policy is the only answer. That is why I say that the analysis in the White Paper no longer has anything to do with genuine mobility, which we want, or with a more environmentally friendly transport policy. That is why we need a radical rethink, above all on freight transport, where we need a move to rail and waterways. This is therefore about a shift to environmentally friendly modes of transport and about making sustainability our basis and our yardstick. Economic growth and transport growth must not be taken as givens either, because as transport politicians we actually also need to consider whether it is also possible to cut some traffic out altogether. In my view the White Paper tends to neglect this aspect. I believe that the Commission has drawn the right conclusions from this analysis and that it has initiated many good measures. We have made substantial progress in rail policy and we have also made progress on maritime safety, not least – unfortunately – thanks to the Erika
 and the Prestige
. One further very complicated area is still missing and that is internalising external costs. Put into plain language, this means that not all of those who travel on the roads, by rail or on water pay the same price for what they actually use. That is why I hope that a serious proposal will be forthcoming from the Commission very soon – that we will then discuss in detail – so that we can guarantee that all modes of transport bear a fair cost burden, based on true and transparent costs. My final point, Commissioner, is one that you addressed in your speech earlier. Enlargement is nearly upon us and I think that we need to do all we can to avoid repeating the same mistakes or again adopting the same unfortunate transport policies that we have seen implemented in the Member States over the last 30 or 40 years. We must not repeat these mistakes with the new Member States. That is why I believe that you have a very considerable responsibility to avoid these mistakes with the new Member States and also to work with them to put in place, at an early date, a good and fair European transport policy. (Applause)

 Mr President, in the German press preview there was a headline that is very apt for this dossier. It read: fresh goods need fresh drivers. It is actually the case that we are usually more concerned with the economy and competition, and that all too often the issue of safety and the life and health of the public is given short shrift. We recently experienced the Prestige
 disaster. When there is an accident at sea or in the air the public in Europe is outraged, but the daily deaths on our roads are something that we have obviously become accustomed to. We should not become accustomed to them, however, because there are – as the statistics show – two main causes of accidents on our roads. The first is HGVs with overtired drivers, who are at the wheel for far too long, and the second, increasingly, is the express services, the so-called sprinter class, which represent the greatest potential for danger on our roads and motorways. That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to include these express services, this sprinter class, in this regulation. In the committee we arrived at a consensus on a series of sensible rules for driving times and rest periods that are realistic and geared to the needs of both drivers and companies. I think it is sensible, if at all possible, for drivers to spend their weekly rest periods at home, where they live, with their families. It is also sensible, if they are nearly at a ferry and can spend their rest time there, for the driving times and rest times to allow them to reach that ferry. Obviously it is not sensible to spend a rest time in a travelling vehicle, and we have therefore stated this in the text. As Mr Grosch has already said, we can adopt as many wonderful, detailed, even obsessively detailed, rules as we like, but if they cannot be enforced then they are just words. For me, in any case, this is also one of the most important points. At present we have an average inspection rate of barely 1% and it is actually only possible to carry out real inspections, real checks, if both the roadside check on what the vehicle is doing and the check on the undertaking are done in tandem. However, practice in the Member States of the Community is very variable and it is for this reason, Commissioner, that the transitional period, between our bidding farewell to the traditional tachograph and introducing the digital tachograph, has to be as short as possible, so that we can inspect all of the HGVs in the Community by means of a digital tachograph as soon as possible. The fact that this allows a period of 28 days to be monitored in a roadside check will make a huge contribution to improving safety on Europe's roads. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Helmut Markov, who has done a good job, was very willing to compromise and united us behind his proposals, and also the other Members who were shadow rapporteurs for this dossier.

 Mr President, anyone who does as I and a number of my colleagues in this group have done, and spends time with the fishermen on the Galician coast, will discover how urgently European aid is needed there. I think this House would do well to agree to that today and tomorrow. Arriving in Santiago de Compostela, one is aware that it marks the end of the Way of St James, with which the Commissioner will be familiar. The Way of St James is the route taken by pilgrims and sinners in order to do penance for their sins. We know that this path ought to be trudged by a whole host of Heads of State and Government, along with their Transport Ministers, in order to do penance for their sins of omission. The sin recorded against their names is that of inadequate port State control. (Applause)
 If you sign up to 25%, but only manage to come up with 9%, as one Member State has done, then that amounts to a great sin. The charge sheet reads: lack of a decent system of European ports of refuge. Mr Haarder, that was decided on a considerable time ago, but the Council has not yet set it up. The charge sheet reads: absolute failure when it comes to a compensation fund for oil disasters. Parliament decided on this one and a half years ago, but until today the Council has had nothing to say on the subject. Mr Haarder, the Prestige
 sailed past Copenhagen. Let us remind ourselves of the route it took. Coming from Latvia, it passed through the Baltic, the Skaggerak, the Channel, the Bay of Biscay and past Galicia – it could have happened anywhere. In the Baltic, though, there are four candidate countries, which keep themselves well covered when it comes to safety at sea. Malta and Cyprus were always among the flags of convenience under critical discussion. Commissioner, what we need from the Commission by April 2003 is a report deciding whether and, if so, how all these candidate countries should play their part in Europe's policy on safety at sea. The Prestige
 – as Mr Haarder will be aware – could also have broken up in the ‘Kadettrinne’, one of the most dangerous places in the Baltic Sea, the scene of innumerable accidents, near-accidents and ships being driven the wrong way. This is where we need to make pilots mandatory. The Council and the Commission must bring pressure to bear on Russia in order to get a general requirement for pilots introduced via the IMO. This is one of the most dangerous places in Europe for traffic at sea. If it is our intention to withdraw single-hulled tankers from circulation, then we need more double-hulled tankers. Perhaps you could have a word with your fellow-Commissioner Mr Monti about what we should do about future aid for Europe's shipyards.

 Mr President, the 'Prestige' tanker disaster is an appalling tragedy. We must show solidarity here, and – as our Portuguese and Spanish colleagues should know – it must be tangible rather than abstract. That is why the region and the people there need assistance from Europe quickly. I do not think that anyone would question this. We should be aware, however, that this disaster could be repeated any day, Commissioner, because for years it has been the same old story. The combination of an ancient tanker that is only fit for the scrap heap and a flag of convenience – this time of the Bahamas – is usually the cause. Flags of convenience are synonymous with poor quality, a poor vessel, poor technology and a poor crew. Usually the story ends with a coordinated reluctance to claim responsibility so that no one knows any more who is actually to blame for what. That, Commissioner, is the reason for Paragraph 3 of our motion. As soon as all of the information is on the table, we will expect to receive a report from you stating who was responsible for this disaster, when, how and why. I think that a few words will also have to be reserved for the Spanish authorities in this context. I have been surprised at some of the statements made by ministers of transport over the last few days and at the demands that they are now making. Clearly these transport ministers have forgotten that, for example, the regulation on compensation in cases of liability for oil pollution, which the Commission and Parliament have passed, has been lying on the table in the Council for over a year without any action being taken. Commissioner, you have Parliament's full support if you want to put a bomb under these gentlemen in the Council so that we finally get legislation soon. Where incidents of this kind are concerned, we have to call to account the oil companies, the shipowners, the cargo owners and the classification societies. The system of flags of convenience cannot continue in its present form, Commissioner. I appeal to you to consider making a proposal on this. We need European shipping; we need good European vessels with good European crews. Flags of convenience are a blight on the system. Help to eradicate them by making a good Commission proposal. Parliament will give it speedy consideration. (Applause)

 Madam President, I am able to agree with Mr Cocilovo, and also to go some of the way with Mr Sterckx. We are dealing today with a slight reworking of the TENs. The really major revision will be in 2004, when we will certainly put our heads together and draw up sensible amendments for them. Thanks are due to the rapporteur for the work he has done, but also for the unsparing conclusion he draws. What is crucial is that, of the fourteen Essen projects, three have been completed, which means that the Council had at that time bitten off more than it could chew. Not listening to Parliament, it was guided by obstinacy rather than wisdom. Nobody, not even Parliament, can lay down the law to a Member State when it comes to when and where this or that project is to be put into effect. But, when a Member State says that it wants to have a project certified as being of European Community interest, then that Member State must comply with European conditions. That is why the rapporteur's proposal – that, if a project is not completed within a specified time, it is taken off the priority list – is very good. This proposal by the Commission is realistic and sensible. It deals with environmentally friendly forms of transport, and, so, tomorrow, we should support it accordingly. I can tell the Council that they would be well advised not to conjure up any conflict between the institutions on this point. It would not be worth it, as we have already made a whole series of changes to the TENs. That means that we should work together well... (The President cut the speaker off.)

 Mr President, the post and the postal services are indeed not just any old commodity and not any old service; they are, rather a very sensitive article, one that also needs to be handled with care. In the first round, the Commission did not, I think, comply with this request which had been addressed by Parliament, and the Common Position with the Council is, I think, a good compromise, which does justice to both the public interest and also to the interests of the people and employees it affects. Faced with the scepticism that has been expressed, we also need to articulate clearly what we are voting on this week. It is only from 2006 onwards that things will get exciting. We then want the Commission to inform us how the universal service is to be financed. There is no blank cheque; instead we are getting a study. There is no automatic behaviour here; instead we want to know in the most exact terms – for that is the crucial thing – whether, as for example Mr Mastorakis put it, people in rural areas on islands are to continue to get a good postal service. That will be the case only in 2006. I thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as I think he has brought the various Parliamentary interests and the Council together, so that this week, I believe, we can manage to get a good majority for a good compromise. (Applause)

Mr President, I would like to join those who have spoken before me in expressing thanks to you, to the Commissioner, to your colleagues and also to our rapporteurs, for I do think it was a good thing that we, as Parliament and Commission, worked together so closely on this issue. That today is, of all days, the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika, is not something that should fill us entirely with pride, for two years have passed before today's debate and tomorrow's vote. Then it will take a bit longer for it all to be implemented. It should be done more quickly next time! The results are actually quite respectable. We are getting the safe double hull tankers more quickly. The old single hull tankers will be phased out with effect from 2003, and port state control will at last live up to its name. Stricter controls mean for me that blacklists will be used rigorously and, in consequence, black sheep, or black ships, will no longer be welcome in European ports. Classification societies for ship types will be subject to stricter conditions. Although we know that the majority of these societies do sound work, they must no longer be permitted to be slipshod in what they do. The Member States now have 18 months in which to transpose all this. The legal framework is in place. Yet laws that only exist on paper are, in the final analysis, ridiculous. What use is port state control without controllers? I therefore believe – and here we are putting our trust in you, Commissioner – that you will have to check very punctiliously how the Member States transpose the things we have just brought into being. It will cost the Member States money, but safety at sea must be worth the expense. So here are two more points. One is something I have already mentioned. Erika II must not be allowed to last as long as Erika I did. Accidents involving oil are one thing, but damage to people, nature, fisheries and tourism are something else, and result not only from accidents involving oil, but also from those involving chemicals and other hazardous substances. So we should implement more quickly the proposals Parliament has made. My final point is that enlargement of the EU is almost upon us, involving as it does two candidate states, Malta and Cyprus, which have cropped up in discussions again and again. So I would again implore the Commissioner to apply the so-called acquis communautaire
 very stringently to these states too in the event of their becoming members of the EU, so that there may be no black sheep, only white ones. I have said already that we have a saying to the effect that one is in the hand of God at sea and in court! As far as the sea is concerned, we can give the Almighty a bit of a helping hand, so that everything will be safer, and that is what we should be doing with the Erika package. (Applause)

 Mr President, I wish to endorse Mr Jarzembowski's remarks for another reason. The plenary has substantively amended a Commission item by a large majority.

Mr President, you will not be surprised to learn that I see things in quite the opposite way to Mr Schmitt. What is true is that we need a European legal framework for public local transport, as there is legal uncertainty and the market has already been opened up. The question is, though, how closely to the citizens Europe's decisions must be taken on a given subject. Local public transport is, in my view, primarily the responsibility of local authorities and that is how it should stay. Towns and parishes should themselves decide whether they want to run their local public transport by their own enterprise, and then whether they are able to do so. It is also clear that those who say they are going to do it themselves must not be allowed to compete elsewhere. I wish to thank Mr Meijer, the rapporteur, for pursuing this basic idea with, if I may say so, a certain stubbornness, as this issue of community decision-making is an important point. My second point is that where there is competition in local public transport provision, it can lead to minimal wages and social dumping. My dear Mr Schmitt, a bus driver working on regular services does not earn a fortune – barely DM 200 above the social security rate in Germany. It is for that reason that social minima must be maintained when there is a change of operator. My third point is that local public transport is run in many Member States' rural areas by small and medium-sized enterprises. These must not be unnecessarily squeezed out of the market, quite the contrary. I believe they must also have a chance in the market when routes or networks are awarded directly. The situation prevails in any case, in many areas of Germany, that up to 90% of local public transport is to and from schools, and here too, the direct awarding of contracts must be given more of a chance. I think we can agree that the Commission's time limits for contracts and handing-over are both too short, and we strove together for their extension. As regards the other things, our opinions simply differ and, unlike Mr Schmitt, I believe that tomorrow will not see a catastrophe, but that we will be very close to the communities in deciding in their favour on public local transport. (Applause)

Mr President, ports, particularly seaports, are normally cosmopolitan systems and they are junctions in the TENs for traffic by ship and sea, which is in principle the most environmentally-friendly mode of transport. The openness of seaports, though, bears no relation whatever to the system by which they are financed. Far from it; I think opacity, very often intentional, is the right word to use for it. To put it in nautical language: when it comes to financing seaports, the bulkheads are closed. The present financial structures could be described as hazy and must be changed. I believe that tomorrow's vote must be about transparency in financial relationships and in State finance, for that is the first requirement for fair competition between seaports. Granted, that is not exactly easy. Ports are under private, State, joint State and private, and public control, but all of them are enterprises in competition with each other, and so we need fair conditions. Aid is unobjectionable, but it must be aid for all. The problem is, I think, that competition between ports has to be organised. In principle, it occurs within ports or should do so, if all the Community regulations are brought into play. Pilot services are another issue. We see them as a public duty, serving safety at sea and the safety of man and nature, and the Member States have essentially reasonable regulations on them. I believe it would be possible to extend them in view of the recurrent accidents off the German Baltic coast. One sometimes gets the impression that, when it comes to navigation, many ships use the Shell atlas and nothing else. So, safety at sea with pilot services must not fall victim to the alleged pressure on costs exerted by competition. I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur. I know that he has had a difficult job, but his shadow does not always have an easy time of it either.

Mr President, I think we can agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner's main remarks. I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said. I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner, whether she is able to concur with our view that we can learn from our experiences to date with the Trans-European Networks. One insight we have gained, for example, is that when the Heads of State and Government decide upon a list, it is not necessarily better than a list of priorities drawn up by Parliament. Might we perhaps put this experience to use? In any case, I find the Commissioner's approach in the White Paper, concentrating on rail and waterways, very much worthy of support. The issue there is whether or not we should check all the financing instruments, not only the money we have for the TEN, with that in mind. For if it is only in the TEN that priority is given to rail and waterways, then the other funds – for example the Cohesion Fund and others – will have to be looked at and checked with a view to their perhaps taking these new priorities into account as well for the sake of consistency. Those are my two questions.

Mr President, as I said last time: before the courts and on the high seas, we are in God's hands, but at least the Erika I and Erika II packages will help to make the high seas a little safer. I should like to offer the rapporteurs my warmest thanks. I think it makes sense and that, with a monitoring and control system, with an independent agency and with a compensation fund in the event of accidents, we have taken a step in the right direction. As part of this – and this also applies to the Esclopé report – the Commission has proposed setting up a fund for oil pollution, or rather for oil pollution from tankers. But it has been our experience over recent years that it is not just tanker accidents which cause pollution; other ships also pollute the environment with dangerous substances, often harmful substances such as so-called bunker oil. That is why it makes sense to opt for a more comprehensive approach here. For once, I would gladly have heard the Commission comment along the lines of a huge car advertising campaign running in Germany: ‘Can't be done, doesn't exist’. So, Commissioner, when you take a stand here, please do not start by saying it ‘can't be done’. Start by saying, ‘how can I accommodate Parliament?’ and then make it legally and technically possible. I think the committee is right to spread the risk by making shipowners and charterers, as well as oil companies, bear their share of the risk, by apportioning responsibility on an equitable basis and by including local representatives of the regions affected in a fund committee, so that their interests can be represented. And representing interests does not mean taking their own decisions; it means being included and being heard on a case by case basis. That is why, as I said last time, we should up the ante now because people, because the Erika
 – damn it all, this accident occurred over two years ago and we have still not passed any legislation and everything still hangs in the balance. That is why I call on my fellow Members and the Commission to up the ante now. I think it makes sense to make a start on maritime safety by setting up an agency. I understand why Emmanouil Mastorakis thinks that Piraeus would be a good place for the agency but may I say that I think that Lübeck, where I come from, would also make an excellent base for such an agency.

Mr President, in German there is a saying that goes ‘before the court and on the high sea one is in God's hands’. Before the court this is certainly likely to be the case, but on the high sea we can give God a helping hand, and I believe that the Commission did this when it originally put forward the Erika I package. We should perhaps recollect here that this package also included the port state control administrations, the classification societies, and proposals with regard to double-hulled vessels. I too would like to thank Mr Ortuondo and Mr Watts very warmly for their work. Mr Ortuondo pointed out earlier that one and a half years have now passed and I believe that at some point the people too will say: how long does it actually take you in Europe to pass regulations when a disaster like the Erika takes place? It would be good if the Council would make a bit of an effort, as our colleague Mr Jarzembowski said earlier. The Commission and Parliament are ready. All we need for proper regulation is the Council. I think it is obvious that – as Mr Watts said – the only issue left to discuss is that of the voyage data recorder. We must be able to find a solution here. I have no wish to conceal the fact that I personally am not one hundred percent convinced as regards the issue of ceilings for the liability of classification societies. However, I think that if we as a Parliament want to stay together, then we must be united in a conciliation procedure too. Sometimes, therefore, one must be able to set aside one's own reservations. But an abstention from voting is also a possible way of demonstrating unity in Parliament. Commissioner, I have a small request: could you perhaps, independently of the two dossiers, give an appraisal of what was decided by the IMO at the end of April on the issue of double-hulled vessels, and tell us what the opinion of the Commission is on it? That would be good, because then we would have the whole package. We clearly ought to enter into the conciliation procedure with the Council. But maybe then it would not take so long. Because – and Mr Jarzembowski is quite right – it is high time that we concluded this and time that we were able to tell the public that we have taken political action. The public expects this, and so it must be done.

Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr van Dam. I think he has submitted a very good report. Looking again at the explanatory statement, one realises that it contains a whole lot of arguments and material about what is happening on Europe's roads. What is happening on Europe's roads can either be described as criminal or disgraceful, or both at the same time, and it is often simply unacceptable. The fact that we are not solving all the problems with this dossier has been described in detail by Mr van Dam in his report. However, I think that we are really getting to grips with at least one important matter, that of clamping down on social dumping by a few black sheep in the haulage sector. One must always stress that the great majority, as I believe, do things by the book. Here we are talking about a very few people, but their behaviour has devastating consequences. Driving and rest periods are one thing, and these must be adhered to, there is no question about that; the social conditions of the drivers are the other aspect of this. All drivers have a right to be employed in accordance with the conditions that usually apply in the Member States. The attempt to use two drivers from central or eastern Europe to comply with the driving and rest periods, while at the same time gaining competitive advantages by means of wage dumping, must be stopped, because if two drivers together earn less than a driver who is employed on the usual terms, then that is simply out of order. It is a disgrace and must be denounced as such. It is good, therefore, that we are starting with third countries first, as we have suggested. We should not wait too long to extend this to the Union, and to the Member States, so that this regulation applies to everyone. I hope that it will not take as long as the ERIKA package, but that we can arrive at a regulation speedily. Eastward expansion is imminent and we need to have decent social conditions, but also fair conditions for competition, on our roads and in the haulage industry.

Mr President, I must admit, it is a wonderful feeling to be able to speak at this hour to such a large audience and it will perhaps be even more wonderful tomorrow, when a report is finally adopted, because it has been a long haul. In 1996, at the end of the conciliation procedure, we had the Commission communication on improving ports in the trans-European networks. Then a proposal was submitted at a very late stage and in March 1999 we had the first reading, which is when we should really have discussed the review of the TEN. Then the Council took its time. In October 2000, we had the second reading and it was only under the pressure of the conciliation procedure that we held a proper discussion and moved any closer to the Council’s standpoint. It could all have been much quicker and simpler and, in the meantime, it is now 2001. Nonetheless, I think the end is in sight. We now have a reasonable classification of ports as international – Community – ports and regional ports, with acceptable categories for tonnage and passenger volumes. The same applies to inland ports with a volume of 500 000 tonnes of freight, which I think is a proper order of magnitude. We have mainly included ports and inland ports as nodes in the trans-European networks, i.e. they act as nodal points for the rest of the trans-European connections. We have included intermodal terminals in the text, so that, as a carrier, combined transport supports the railways and inland waterways and underlines their particular importance. After lengthy discussion, we also have a perfectly proper and reasonable definition as to what constitutes infrastructure and what can and cannot be aided in ports and inland ports. At the same time, we have amended Project No 8, one of the major projects of the Essen Council’s 14 projects, which was later confirmed in Dublin, in close harmony in the codecision procedure, which was very difficult at the time. I am particularly pleased that the Commission has promised to include the Elbe-Lübeck Canal in its proposal at the next revision. I am also grateful, Commissioner, to your comrades-in-arms at the Commission, who were extremely helpful in the closing stage, coming forward with one new proposal after another, so that, in the end, we did not need to go right through with the conciliation procedure and were able to reach an agreement before then. If I may add a comment: in my view, we overestimated the TEN somewhat right from the outset. We said both in Committee and in Parliament: let us set our sights a little lower! These errors should not be repeated during the revision. The Commission tabled some excellent proposals on the trans-European networks in the initial stages of the consultation and we should revert to them. That means not just stringing and stitching together what the Member States provide you with; it also means that the Commission should set its own priorities. As we spend so much time here talking about special dossiers, about rail and water, I hope, Commissioner, that the priority of rail and water in the TEN will be reflected in the Commission proposal. I think that, on balance – even if it has taken a long time – we have done a good job. I should like to thank everyone who was involved, my fellow members in Parliament, the Commission and the French Presidency of the Council for bringing it all to a successful conclusion.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should focus on what the report actually says, for I think that substantial parts of it still show the hand of Mrs Isler Béguin. I welcome that, and I would also like to thank the Committee Chairman who finished the work. No one would dispute that nuclear energy and the transport of nuclear waste fall within the competencies of the Member States. Of course, if agreements have been concluded, they must also be adhered to, especially as far as transport is concerned. Transporting radioactive material is not a risk-free business, as the report points out. So I think that what the report says is important: firstly, the safety of people and the environment must have absolute priority; secondly, full information must be provided to the local authorities and community. Many people in Germany, in particular, are worried at present; they are upset about what lies ahead. Being able to voice their opinion and take part in demonstrations is part of that. We are united in our condemnation of violence against people and property, because it is counterproductive. For our part, let me say this: the proposal put forward in Germany by a politician by the name of Möllemann to carry out the Castor transports by airship must also be rejected. It would certainly be impossible to comply with safety requirements and would merely make the transport of radioactive waste even more hazardous. Mrs Isler Béguin, you and I would probably phase out nuclear energy tomorrow, but we do not make up the majority in the world, or in this society. So we should concentrate on this communication so that in the immediate future, the transport of radioactive waste is as safe as possible. If we have then achieved what the German Government has set out to do, namely to agree on and complete the phasing-out of nuclear energy, the two of us might have attained our goal in a few years' time.

Madam President, the Postal Services Directive of 1997 provided for a gradual and controlled opening of postal markets to private providers. The House certainly has no problems with that. At the same time, the directive provided for the preservation of a high-quality universal service, and that is the real crux of the matter. The point is that a universal service needs to be funded, and this has been said a few times already. The Commission stated at the time that it would present studies and data and figures on the implications of the funding requirement. We are still waiting for these. So there remains something of an unresolved question, namely what and how much it takes to establish and finance the sort of reserved domain that will guarantee us a good, solid universal service. It is therefore desirable that Parliament should not subscribe to the battering-ram strategy proposed by the Commission and should adhere to the strategy of controlled and gradual opening of the postal markets. And as for employment, my dear Markus, we see things differently. It goes without saying that the postal services are not a job-creation programme. But this Parliament and the European Union also have some responsibility for employment and for the social conditions in which the postal services operate. Whether the new providers create jobs and the number and quality of such jobs cannot be a matter of indifference to us, nor can the number and nature of the jobs that are to be preserved by the traditional providers of postal services. These things must also be our concern. Let me say this to Georg and Markus: when the postman calls once, or even twice, we are well aware that this is not the ultimate social service in Europe. But when grandma is happy because she has a friendly postman, which is also a factor in the quality of postal services, we should not begrudge her that pleasure but be happy with her. I should like to express my very sincere thanks to Markus Ferber, because he has shown himself very willing indeed to compromise so that we could put together a constructive proposal. This is it now – I think – and the Commission will take it from here with our wholehearted support. Provided it proposes a high-quality universal service as a dynamic blueprint for the future, the Commission will have our support, but not otherwise. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is good that we are discussing and adopting the maritime safety package at first reading today. What is less satisfactory, as has just been pointed out, is our past record; heaven knows that the States of the European Union have scarcely covered themselves in glory in the realm of maritime safety. We know, of course, that port state control has not been a potent guarantor of maritime safety in the past, we know that the classification societies have not all discharged their duties as shipping inspectorates properly and conscientiously and that some of them have tended to be slipshod, and we know that tankers without double hulls are floating time bombs. The more appalling thing, however, is that we knew all of this before the Erika 
sank. Parliament has highlighted this situation time and again, and the sad fact is that the progress made since then would never have happened without this disaster and the public pressure that followed it. Nevertheless, it is all the better that we are set to act, at long last, today. I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that you recognise Parliament's demand on port state control which Mr Watts made in his report. My first request to you is that the Council sign, seal and deliver this very quickly. It will then be law, as it were, and can be put into practice. I believe that some rethinking will certainly have to be done between the Council and Parliament on the liability limit for classification societies, irrespective of what is decided today. We shall agree to an international regime for double-hull tankers, but only on condition that a set of IMO rules is actually created in April. Our committee unanimously supports this linkage. If IMO rules do not materialise, we shall need European legislation. But we hope that IMO rules will be adopted in April. For these double-hull tankers we shall need many good and safe new vessels. I should like to see European shipyards winning the orders to build these ships in fair and open competition. The Commission recently presented a report in which it documented the fact that Korea is pursuing a very unfair dumping policy in the shipbuilding industry. For that reason, Commissioner, I earnestly appeal to you and to your colleague, Commissioner Monti, to pledge this assistance which our shipyards need so urgently and to do so before Christmas. The shipyards of Europe are beset by uncertainty. Please help to ensure that the Commission sends a clear signal here. We are working to establish new credibility; we should not jeopardise it by letting the Commission take the wrong course of action. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to make a general comment about the procedural position here, as it seems to me a classic example of how codecision should not be conducted. Following the first reading in Parliament, it took a year before we received the Council's common position, which takes almost no account at all of Parliament's views. And now, because of the timescales involved, such as the intervening summer recess, the situation is that Parliament has virtually no alternative but to repeat its position at first reading, with the result that we will all be merrily wending our way to the conciliation procedure. This really is not how the codecision procedure should be conducted, at least not in my opinion. I am directing this comment to the Council: since Amsterdam there has been an ever increasing flow of legislative work on transport in particular. We would save time, money and energy procedurally speaking if the Council could appreciate and accept that a common position is not the end point of the decision-making process. It is an important stage in that process, but the process then continues and it must then come before Parliament. What is this all about? During the first trans-European network round, the issue of ports remained unresolved. At that time, the Commission undertook to prepare an appropriate proposal on ports. It has done that and has also extended the proposal to include not only seaports, but also inland ports and intermodal terminals, including Project No 8 of the 14 major projects in Essen, which is to be modified. Parliament has welcomed the Commission's approach of bringing together seaports, inland ports and terminals, because these are interrelated interconnection points in the transport network. The Council has only accepted certain parts of Parliament's proposals and totally departs from Parliament's criteria for interconnection points. I wish to concentrate on the most important aspects. First, seaports. Parliament would like the criteria here to be a traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes and 200 000 passengers, and also, as a vital and key criterion, a connection with another trans-European network. The Council wants a maximum of 1 million tonnes without a connection to other trans-European networks. However, this means that in my own dearly beloved Schleswig-Holstein, the region I come from, a place like Langballigau, which has at most one bridge and two bollards where a ship can tie up, has overnight turned into a European seaport, which is pure nonsense. Parliament simply cannot allow something like this to go through. In the case of inland ports, Parliament would like the criterion to be an annual traffic volume of 500 000 tonnes, as against the Council's criterion of just 300 000. The result is that an additional 200 smaller ports would be included. There would be so many and they would be so small you would need a magnifying glass to find them. That is not acceptable. I believe that if we are talking about a trans-European network, the seaports and inland ports involved should meet minimum requirements for European transport functions. Parliament has endorsed the inclusion of intermodal terminals, whereas the Council completely disagreed with this, although terminals will of course have a far more significant part to play in future European transport policy than they perhaps do at present. Ports are in competition with each other, and that is a good thing. But in order to guarantee a level playing field Parliament requested that we should not be promoting superstructure investments but, at most, investment in infrastructure. The Council has so far not been able to accept this basic concern, and neither has the Commission, by the way. So we must work together to find solutions that will ensure a level playing field in terms of infrastructure. One point that I welcome here is that the Council has evidently accepted the modification of Project No 8. Parliament is in agreement with this. However, this also means that the Council has finally accepted that codecision should also apply to the 14 important Essen projects. Whatever we agree tomorrow will ultimately have to go into the conciliation procedure. I would specifically like to acknowledge the French Presidency's efforts to establish a common approach at this early stage. The Council is being somewhat obstructive here. My thanks also go to the Commission's officials, who have already been very helpful on this. Nevertheless, it would have been good if everything could have proceeded a little faster than it has in the event. And last but not least I would like to thank my fellow Members in the committee, who have all pulled in the same direction. I would like to comment on Amendment No 15. The peripheral areas have been omitted from the English translation again, it is the original German version that applies. I hope that the Sittings Service will put this right so that the peripheral areas are once again referred to in all versions. And I would once again like to sincerely thank my colleagues in the committee for their cooperation. I hope that after tomorrow's vote we will be able to move promptly on to the conciliation procedure and not drag things out for the full six weeks.

 Mr President, and I would have been very surprised if you had not been the one to chair this sitting again. After all, it is a good day for Europe’s seas, as it for you personally, Mr President, because I know you are a keen diver. We would all be delighted if you had even cleaner waters to dive in in Europe. But the sea is our primary concern. I believe we are in a position to congratulate each other today. We can congratulate both the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, and the delegation, because we have succeeded in improving some crucial aspects of the directive, or should I say, the Council’s common position. It had been watered down, and I believe Parliament has secured coherent measures for all concerned Firstly, mention has been made of the fact that all ports will have to provide reception facilities for waste and cargo residues. This is an important step. Secondly, all ships will have to pay, irrespective of whether or not they use the facilities. That is the real principle that is being brought into play here for the first time. The sums involved will not be small; they will be considerable. It is true that we cannot be completely satisfied with 30%. That much is absolutely clear. Nevertheless, the 30% introduces and establishes the principle of a ‘no special fee system’. Naturally there is room for improvement, but with this principle in place, every one will have to pay their way. Thirdly, all Member States must carry out checks on at least 25% of shipping. I believe we should urge them to exceed the 25%. We should challenge them to increase the number of checks. After all, on so many occasions, we have been forced to recognise that, where ships docked at ports are concerned – take the ‘Erika
’ for example, or other ships – monitoring is one of the crucial issues. If there is no monitoring, there is no point in having any regulations. On balance, the point of this directive is that the criminal discharge of waste on the high seas will no longer be as profitable as it used to be. I also feel that marine pollution should no longer be treated as a trivial offence. Europe’s seas are becoming cleaner, which will benefit the flora and fauna, and not least, the fishing industry. This directive will also have a very positive effect on tourism, in the long run, for it will scarcely be possible to sustain tourism if there are no clean beaches. So it is a good day for Europe’s seas and also a good day for you, Mr President. (Applause)

 Mr President, I am pleased that you are the one chairing this debate because I know that as a Bavarian you always offer a sympathetic ear where ports and maritime matters are concerned, and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for the work which he has done and also for cooperating with us in the run-up to tomorrow's vote. There are a few points at stake tomorrow. Firstly, we know that the ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport for carrying passengers and goods. At the same time we know that ships make a hefty contribution to polluting the sea with rubbish, cargo residues and oily slime. The fuel used by ships happens to be heavy oil and we know that this heavy oil leaves a residue of between 1% and 3% as oily slime, which is typically discharged into the sea. I think that we agree that ships have to dispose of waste and residues in port. It follows – and in fact there is no other logical conclusion – that the cardinal rule for clean seas is that it must no longer be worthwhile for waste to be disposed of illegally on the high seas. This is what this is about, and a majority of us have said as much in debates here. In January we had a very thorough debate with you, Commissioner, on the consequences of the Erika
 disaster. On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas. And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is, of course, also about the question of how to make our seas cleaner. Just for information, we know that 70 000 m3 of detritus is illegally discharged into the North Sea alone every year and, conversely, we know that at present a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships obey the rules and dispose of their waste in port. This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either. The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them. The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made. In its first reading, Parliament said by a large majority that the ships must make a significant contribution, of at least 90%. And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made. But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little. Nothing would change. There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules. What is needed is a standard waste disposal fee for all ships irrespective of how much they actually use the disposal facilities, meaning that the financial incentive to dispose of waste at sea has to be removed, which – as has already been explained here today – was possible in the Baltic Sea through the HELCOM Agreement and the ‘no-special-fee’ system. If it can be done there it must also be possible for it to work for the remaining European seas, because this is not only about the environment: it is about clean waters, it even has consequences for tourism and – the decisive point – alongside the environmental issue it is also about fair competition. The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament, the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships. I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and, in particular, Parliament. I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe, as we saw of course with ‘Erika’. Oil comes onto the beaches and then politicians and ministers appear and try to clear it up themselves with a tiny little bucket, but when a fortnight later a robust directive is up for debate they have forgotten yesterday's fine words. We will not be able to rule out accidents altogether, but we can take optimal precautions. This consistent directive is an important step towards doing this. I also hope that our liberal colleagues will perhaps reconsider before tomorrow whether they might not – including for reasons of parliamentary identity – join us once again as they did in the first and also in the second reading, because we will then be going into the conciliation procedure anyway and there we will have to see how much ground the Council can give. I believe – for environmental and competition reasons as well as on the basis of the decisions made two months ago, in January – that we should adopt these amendments tomorrow, in the form in which we debated them in the committee, with a broad majority.

 Mr President, Commissioner, there comes a time when you have to – what a shame, she is not listening when people speak, that is not good! A good Commissioner should listen! Can that be deducted from the time? Commissioner, I actually wanted to address a minor comment to you, which applies both to this report and to the preceding one. There comes a time when you have to come to a decision, because post-Amsterdam the conciliation procedure is the great good. Parliament is obviously always pleased when the Commission fights at Parliament's side as its partner and does not necessarily rush obediently to the Council's cause. I do not believe that this is necessary here. I wanted actually to relate this comment to the report before us. The President has read out a very laborious title. Mr President, with your permission I will simply talk about lorry inspections; that would be understood both in Regensburg and in Lübeck, and perhaps the Commission might also perhaps manage to use somewhat shorter titles. I think that we simply cannot do enough for road traffic safety. There is a consensus on that. This directive on lorry inspections should quite simply make a contribution to this. We are seeing a slight fall in the number of those killed and injured on the roads. Nevertheless – and regrettably – where the accidents involve lorries the numbers of those both killed and injured are rising. The causes are often precisely technical defects. We must not sit back and accept this. After all, a lorry does around 150 000 kilometres a year. This is an inconceivably high number compared with a private car. When it is under a strain of this kind, maximum technical roadworthiness is required in the interests of road safety, environmental protection and not least equitable competition. Because a fleet of lorries in a poor state of technical repair should certainly not have a competitive advantage, and conversely no haulier should be punished if he keeps his lorries in optimal technical condition. Now Europeans are obviously not so well behaved that they can manage without checks. This directive tries to cater for this problem by introducing a graduated inspection procedure until the vehicle is taken out of service. There has been a high measure of agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, apart from on one problem and that is penalties. In its common position, the Council makes no mention of any arrangements. This is obviously nonsense because if I am going to carry out inspections there have to be penalties which I can use as a threat in borderline cases. Then the Council said – and these might not be its exact words – that the penalties would be directed at the Member States. No, penalties should be directed at hauliers, lorry-owners and drivers. That is why – as discussed in the committee – I have now tabled an amendment to Amendment No 2 which contains no reference to the concept of ‘harmonisation’. I have done this in the knowledge that the Council is going some way to accommodate us and that we in turn can also then accommodate the Council, because this directive, in my view, is a logical step forwards. Nevertheless – and the Council has to be aware of this – it is of course sensible that the Member States should have to reach an agreement, sooner or later, amongst themselves in the Council about these controls and the penalties threatened, because it would be ridiculous if for example offences carried almost a prison sentence in Finland and only a small fine in a southern country, or vice versa. That would not make any sense. Neither is it very European. That is why, on the procedure, I should like to say once more that Amendment No 3 replaces Amendment No 2 which was adopted by the committee. It ought therefore to be put to the vote first tomorrow. If the Bureau, which will be chairing the vote tomorrow, could be informed of this I would be very grateful. Then we would not have any procedural problems with this. So, put Amendment No 3 to the vote first. It would then replace Amendment No 2. This is what was discussed in the committee, and then we could have this system very quickly and not work towards a costly conciliation procedure for the sake of a solution which is in principle sensible.

 Mr President, one can only welcome the Commissioner’s factual and rational observations, for unlike others, she did not fall prey to collective hypocrisy. The Erika
 catastrophe comes as no surprise. I do not know precisely how many, but any number of ships which are practically floating time bombs in European waters, sail every day, and as far as I can see, a catastrophe of this kind could happen again any day. We have been aware of this here in this Parliament for over ten years now – there was the Commission’s communication and the report by Mr Ken Stewart, which made mention even at that stage of all the areas in which legislation needed to be passed. It all revolves around the ships, the technology, the equipment; we are talking about the ports, how they are organised and what they have to say for themselves, and, of course, it is all about teamwork. We know full well where the opposition to every single, solitary legislative measure has come from in the course of the last few years. It always came from the Member States, from the Council of Ministers, where they fought doggedly over every trifling matter, achieving very little in terms of progress.   If we expect car-owning citizens to have a clean bill of health themselves and to fulfil the legal, personal requirements and also have their cars regularly inspected, then it ought to be possible for the same to apply to ships. Control is the key word here. Is it really pure coincidence that, to a lesser or greater extent, it is always the same states that allow these ships to fly under their flags? So why is there no black list? If there are dangerous death traps in European waters, then why do we not say, as is the case elsewhere, that these should not be allowed to enter European waters and call at European ports? Therefore, what I would really like to see in your catalogue of measures for the summer is overall inspections for all tankers currently sailing in European waters, and I would also like an update on what the Member States have actually subscribed to and indeed implemented so far, in the way of IMO regulations and conventions, for there is still some dragging of feet there. What happened to Erika cannot be put down to sloppy work, but, as far as I am concerned, to collective, criminal responsibility, and we in Parliament will have the opportunity in the course of the next few months, to demonstrate in the case of one matter in particular, whether we are taking this seriously. I am referring to port reception installations, a matter for the Member States. This will come up for discussion again, and when it does, I hope that we will all still hold the same opinions as we do today.
Piecyk (PSE

 Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate. I thought that it was quite superb. On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods – however dangerous they are – which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible. This directive is a contribution to this. What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance. The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive. That is why we can only hope – and we should resolve all of this this week – that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.
Piecyk (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, we have latterly been discussing technical regulations, technical details, regarding which one might ask whether such details are actually the concern of Parliament. Transport safety in all transport operators has always been an important matter of concern to Parliament, particularly, of course, in the transportation of dangerous goods. The annoying thing about the matter before us is that the CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, is extremely dilatory. We therefore find ourselves in the situation of having to concede an extension to the time limit for, as the rapporteur said, it would be senseless if all Member States were now going to have to issue further individual regulations for a set period of time. We therefore need common regulations which are as strict as possible, also for the transportation of dangerous goods. Consequently, one can only fully endorse the proposal of the rapporteur, our committee chairman, and also thank him for the work which he inevitably took on himself. This would have been superfluous if the other authorities had completed their work in good time.

Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, let me start with a word of thanks to the Commission for the support we have always received from it, and also, many times over, to the Italian Presidency of the Council. I found what it had to say clear and precise. Let me say that the resolution we have produced, and the Italian Presidency’s statements today, make it possible for us to come to an agreement, but please let us do so quickly, for we cannot allow this issue to overshadow the elections. So what is this about? After almost a quarter-century of direct elections to the European Parliament, we still have the structure of a parliamentary assembly, but we have to develop into a real parliament, and that is what this Statute is for. Of course, it is only an initial step, which has, of course, to be followed by what has already been laid down in the 1965 Protocol. Only then will we have a real statute for MEPs, and so I appeal to the governments to take this issue up and take it forward. The second point I want to make is that we all know that the current position, with differing salary-related payments and this wretched system for reimbursing travelling expenses, is unsustainable, but let me remind you of a simple truth: these things can only be sorted out together. There will be no Statute unless the way in which travel costs are reimbursed is reformed, but that will not be reformed without a Statute. If you want to detach the one from the other, then you will end up proposing a solution that lacks both fairness and solidarity. This is where we need clarity and transparency; that is how we treat with respect those who elect us and by whose money we are paid. I would like, at this point, to thank all the group chairmen for making it possible to submit a joint resolution, but there are three persons whom I would like to name, without whom we would not have got to where we are, namely the chairman of my group, Mr Barón Crespo, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, and, of course, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox. Following what I hope is the merely temporary collapse of the new constitution, let us, today, send out a very quiet message to the effect that there is perhaps such a thing as progress in Europe after all. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, thank you for your kind words, which I can only acknowledge. In this area of insurance law and protection for victims of accidents there is in fact excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament and I thank you for that. With the Fifth Directive we are consistently continuing to protect victims of accidents following on from the Fourth Directive. It would perhaps be sensible, Mr Bolkestein, if you did not go into individual amendments in the debate, as we will still, in any case, have to discuss them with the Council. I would like to make a few points to clarify the content. I will begin first of all with the issue of jurisdiction. On this issue the Fifth Directive rounds off the Fourth very well indeed. With the Fourth Directive we made it possible for accidents in another country to be settled in the country of residence. After the Fourth Directive was passed there was, on 22 December 2000, the regulation on 
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Provision is made there so that with civil liability insurance the domicile of the injured party can be considered a place of jurisdiction when there is a direct claim. This was made possible for accidents in another country in the Fourth Directive and with the fifth this applies to all accidents. This means that it will not only be possible to settle out of court in one’s own country a claim arising in another, but it will also be possible to begin a legal battle in one’s own. We cannot do more than that for the victims of accidents. What else does this Fifth Directive contain? The costs of judicial proceedings that are deemed to be necessary and appropriate will be reimbursed. When the cost of legal proceedings – for example consultation with a lawyer – are deemed necessary and appropriate, then that is a claim that must be compensated. We must increase the minimum sum. There is a somewhat piecemeal system in the European Union in this area and everybody agrees that, after twenty years, a new provision is needed. Now, it is a question of the amount and there are, of course, problems with this. It is not exactly easy – and I know this only too well – to raise the minimum sum because that obviously also causes an increase in premiums. The compromise that we came to – EUR 5 million for personal injuries and EUR 2 million for damage to property – is a compromise, with which I think the insurance markets can cope. Incidentally, there is one aspect regarding the minimum sum that must not be overlooked, that is to say, adequately protecting those victims of accidents that are the most affected. Everything in me rebels against the idea that a 20-year-old, paralysed after an accident, is left dependent on social security after 20 years, and in the meantime the injuring party, who is infinitely liable, is also financially ruined. This compromise does, therefore, actually make sense. We are creating a provision for trailers on motor vehicles. There is a mention of this in an earlier directive, but there are completely different provisions across the European Union. Often the trailer’s registration number is known but not that of the motor vehicle, and then it is very difficult to settle a claim. I would like to mention two further points Commissioner Bolkestein, which we did not accept in your proposal: Firstly, the person responsible for the settlement of claims taking charge of the provisions of the Green Card Bureaux. We should not carry out this amalgamation, which is superfluous; it damages a system that works, which is what the Green Card Bureaux is. We also dispensed with the provision on the protection of vulnerable travellers; that means making provision for civil liability. That is a very specific problem, and we should work together – the Commission and Parliament – in order to tackle this issue of liability in another directive. On the whole – and I am coming back to where I began – the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission has been so excellent because we held a European dialogue at European level on all of these issues, between insurers, automobile associations, Parliament, and associations of accident victims – I am referring here to the European Transport Law Seminars in Trier. It is precisely because we worked extremely hard in this area and discussed a great deal that we can also find solutions together that will help the victims of accidents. I am confident that in further discussions with the Council we will quickly achieve a result. On the whole, it all helps to take us forward and above all: it encourages us to have a European dialogue because when we do have such a dialogue then solutions are easier.
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to add a footnote to the discussion. The privileges and immunities 
of Members of the European Parliament are still governed by a protocol dating back to 1965 and tailored to the Parliamentary Assembly as it existed at the time. In a letter to the foreign ministers, the Italian Presidency has alluded to the possibility of the protocols being revised, which it sees as desirable. That is something I would very much welcome. Next year, we will have had a directly elected European Parliament for twenty-five years. It is high time for our legal position to be regulated at European level. If not at the Intergovernmental Conference, then when is that to be done? I might say, by the way, that it is a matter of some indifference to me whether these new rules, which are necessary, are instituted under the Statute or by an act of primary legislation. I am not very concerned about that, and see it as a secondary consideration, but it has to happen, and if it does not, there will be no Members’ Statute either. (Applause)
Rothley (PSE

,  (DE)
 Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, when dealing with the issue of European jurisdiction, limited itself to seconding the proposal for the Commission’s preliminary draft, which provides for increases for two reasons; the first being in consequence of enlargement, and the second in response to new tasks for European justice, in which context more funds are allocated for the purposes of documentation and translation. What that means – no more and no less – is that the Commission’s preliminary draft does not include any structural improvements in the conditions under which the European justice system functions. Nevertheless, we went no further than doing this, and I would like to urge the Committee on Budgets not to reduce this still further, for, if we allocate only the funding relating to enlargement, and not the funds for the additional tasks, the situation cannot fail to deteriorate still further. The Committee on Budgets will have to decide whether to take sides with the Council or with the Commission and the Court of Justice. The second point that I would like to address has to do with the Academy of European Law, the work of which, over the past ten years, has met with immense success. Its founding members, Germany and Luxembourg, have since been joined by Ireland, Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden. Finland has announced its intention of joining. Over the past ten years, a total of 38 000 people from the European Union and the new countries have taken part in seminars and training courses. The Academy of European Law has, in that time, become the secretariat of the European Judicial Training Network, and it will, in future, be particularly involved in promoting cooperation between judges in Eastern Europe. All this justifies a commensurate increase in the grants to the Academy of European Law under the financial programme, not only for 2004, but thereafter.

 Mr President, the Commission has certainly made a positive contribution here, for which I offer my sincere thanks. Its support for the Parliament's position is welcome. There has, incidentally, been a misunderstanding about Article 33 that would not have arisen if we had based our discussion on the German text. On the subject of misunderstandings, I would like to point out that the amendment tabled by my group to delete Article 5 of the resolution simply means that, as the Bureau has agreed the reform, it no longer makes any sense of course to call on the Bureau to adopt this particular reform. That has been settled, and there is nothing more to it than that. Perhaps you will permit me, Mr President, to make a further point. We are voting on the Statute today; it is to be adopted today. This is a decision under Article 190(5) of the Treaty. We are not voting on whether we want the reform or not, as some newspapers have suggested. That is not the case at all. We all want the reform. But I would be grateful to those who are highlighting this aspect in particular if they would finally stop denigrating the majority of this House by suggesting that we wanted to block this reform by linking it with other, legitimate political objectives. (Applause)
 This is therefore a decision under Article 190(5). Nevertheless, as far as taxes are concerned, we are open to the Council's proposal that an additional national tax should be introduced for a limited number of Member States. We are quite open to that suggestion. Mr President, your speech yesterday following the vote was a very worthy one. It was a fine speech that was a testament to your political wisdom. It was also courageous, and I hope that this House will summon up the courage to accept its political responsibility. There is a great deal at stake here today. I implore you, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the peoples of Europe, those whom we serve, to summon up that political courage! (Applause)

Mr President, the adoption of Amendment No 6 makes it necessary to make a technical correction to Article 33 (1) and to Article 34 (1). I take it as read that the plenary is happy that this technical correction should be made by the responsible Committee.
Rothley (PSE

rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are nearing the end of a long journey, an odyssey that has, from time to time, seen us wandering far afield and sometimes finding ourselves in choppy waters. The attempt has been made to persuade us that this statute was about nothing more than reforming the reimbursement of travel costs, that it was about money and nothing else. A statute dealing only with money, with its reimbursement, and with costs, is not, though, the sort of statute that the European Parliament needs at the present time. We were told that primary legislation would run aground on the cliffs of the Council, and that our ideas on tax law would drag us down to the depths of the ocean. Now, if I may pick out these as examples, I think that we have good arguments on our side. The two problems that remain to be resolved are taxes and primary law, and – as far as taxes are concerned – the Council thinks it can leave it to each individual Member State to decide whether or not it wants to levy an additional national tax. It so happens that, in 2000, the three legal services – those of Parliament, the Council, and the Commission – met to discuss this issue. The minutes of their deliberations record their conclusion that they could find no justification for a derogation for a Member State, and then they continue in the following terms:
Rothley (PSE
),  
rapporteur
. – (DE)
 So what the Council is now proposing to us is precisely what the three legal services unanimously ruled out. It is obvious that we cannot go along with this! There is a similar situation as regards primary law. Why is it that this House is in this difficult position? It is because, in 1976, when the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage was introduced, the Council fought shy of harmonising the general conditions applicable to the exercise of the mandate. It found that too much of a hot potato. That is why the European Parliament retained the structure of a parliamentary assembly even after it started to be directly elected, a structure it retains to this day. The object of this statute is to break down this parliamentary assembly-style structure and for us to become a real Parliament. That is what the Statute is for! (Applause)
 The fundamental issue is of whether this European Community is a real community or an international organisation. If it were merely an international organisation, then the Council would indeed have the prerogative as regards Members’ privileges and immunities. The question as to whether or not we should now regulate MEPs’ privileges and immunities boils down to the question of whether this European Community is a community or an international organisation, of whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a parliament worthy of the name. That is what it is about! (Applause)
 The rules we have now date back to 1965, when the Protocol was introduced. In that year, Charles de Gaulle beat Mitterrand to win the French presidential elections, and it was in that year that the first contraceptive pill was put on the market. (Laughter)
 And now the Council – it is apparently the Council, although I am unsure, as it used to be only the Permanent Representatives who dealt with these matters – is trying to tell us that it is these rules by which Parliament should continue to be governed in the future, almost a quarter of a century after it was first directly elected. If we do not get to grips with this issue now, then when is it going to be dealt with? After all, it is not as if the Council thought that the system of privileges and immunities had to be reformed. It expressly confirmed that only last year, when the uniform right to vote was introduced. It is clear that the Council sees this as a long-term solution, and of course Parliament cannot accept that. As I have said, the Council has not previously given this issue its serious consideration. The governments are showing themselves to be something less than interested in it. That is why it is no bad idea to say that the Statute should enter into force at the same time as the European Union’s new constitution. We would then have a guarantee that both the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference would do intensive and serious work on this topic, and also that the issues of taxation and of primary law would be discussed at intergovernmental level in an appropriate way. If we now dispense with these rules – which we do not want to come into effect, something they can of course do only after those provisions in the Protocol that are contrary to them have been suspended – then we will remain, for an unforeseeable period of time, in the Council’s Babylonian captivity. That is what this Statute is about! I am very grateful to the Bureau for coming up with rules on the reimbursement of costs, general expenses, the daily subsistence allowance, and the lump sum for staff. That was very helpful and a step in the right direction. I am very grateful to you, Mr President, generally, for having taken more trouble over this Statute than any previous President. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the PPE-DE Group’s Mr Lehne, (Applause)
 who, with his criticisms, his solidarity, and his reliability, has been with this project every step of the way. Many thanks for that, and many thanks to you all! (Applause)

 Mr President, I would specifically like to support this proposal on behalf of my group. There is every justification for proceeding in this way. We amended the Minutes this morning, so that this House's Minutes now say that the PPE-DE Group's motion was tabled first. I would, however, urge you, Mr President, to let this House decide. (Applause)
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, sincere thanks for your work. We have made progress. Thank you also for the letter that you sent to Members, which has clarified a lot of things. Incidentally, I have not forgotten how you supported me in the Conference of Presidents in 1998 over the question of whether the Committee on Legal Affairs should prepare a draft statute. You were chairman of the Liberal Group at the time. That was a long time ago. We intend the resolution as a spur to deeper discussion with the Council of the questions that remain open. We talk about strengthening democracy and not just about salaries, we talk about the dignity of Parliament, whose Members represent 380 million citizens of the European Union, and not just about reimbursement and allowances. Of course those questions need to be settled. I am convinced that the presidency, which is the only body competent to do so, will resolve the system of reimbursements in a way that is understandable and transparent for the general public. Those who speak only about money betray their deep contempt for this Parliament. We are not a gang of con men whose activities have to be stopped. When the European Council introduced direct elections in 1976, it failed to set out the constitutional rights of Members. The Council cannot, more than two decades after the first direct elections, expect us to go without a definition of Members’ constitutional rights. The rules on immunity date back to 1965 and were designed for delegates sent to the Parliamentary Assembly by the national parliaments. The Council cannot expect us not to change anything in those 1965 provisions in the year 2003. I am quite familiar with the legal problems. With a measure of good will on both sides they can be solved. There is a time for everything. Omnia
 tempus
 habent
. I have the feeling that the time for a decision is drawing near. In 1999 the European Council itself called on us – we have quoted it – to bring the question of the Members’ Statute to a conclusion as a matter of urgency. We shall probably deal with the matter for good early next year. We are authorised to submit a report for the plenum. I know there are still problems with primary law, but they can be solved and I would be very grateful if the Council would concentrate on this question and send us concrete pointers for a solution. In any case, the Statute must be adopted before enlargement. It will be virtually impossible afterwards. (Applause)

 Mr President, following the Maastricht Treaty, I was joint rapporteur on the adjustments to the Rules of Procedure that became necessary. I know just how laborious that is, and so my thanks and congratulations to Mr Corbett are all the more heartfelt. Let me make a general comment before I deal with three points raised by the Committee on Legal Affairs. The objective of strengthening plenary and having the great political debates carried on here is a good one, but if you want to do that, you have to give the committees greater responsibility. That is possible only if you raise the hurdles on the route from committee to plenary. That is absolutely imperative. What Mr Corbett and the committee are proposing is going in the right direction. Perhaps we will have to go a little further in the future. There were, and are, three points of importance to the Committee on Legal Affairs. The first is legislative initiatives. Outside, we call for Parliament to have the right to initiate legislation, a right which we have only in a very limited form. The obstacles put in our way by Parliament itself are quite appalling. To take just one example, an initiative by me on discrimination in legal aid was stuck in the Conference of Committee Chairmen for many, many months. These are the obstacles you have to demolish. The second point has to do with the votes to confirm the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole. Here, the procedures in the Member States are utterly different. In Parliament's present position, I consider a secret ballot rather than a roll call to be, in both instances, a very important safeguard for Parliament. As a final point, I concur with what has been said about OLAF. A large number in my group will give it their support.
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, the Legal Affairs Committee and – once this House has given its assent – Parliament as a whole, will be submitting to the Commission a complete proposal for a directive, a legislative initiative on the fixing of book prices in the European Union. Why do we need this initiative? Early in 2000, the Commission decided that the fixing of book prices across the German and Austrian border was incompatible with Community law. We accepted this ruling. Austria responded by enacting a law, Germany initially with a national contractual agreement, but even before this summer, a law on the fixing of book prices is to be enacted in the Federal Republic of Germany. What are we working towards? If Member States do not want to fix book prices, then we do not want to impose it on them. Each Member State is to be able to decide whether to accept this system or not. That is most important, but the national system of book price fixing, which the Commission accepts, are in fact jeopardised by the importing of books, by the practice of exporting and reimporting them and by Internet trading. As one can think of many ways of circumventing the law via these routes, Community law has to contain competition provisions to guarantee that the permissible national systems of book price fixing are not undermined. National rules are also jeopardised by commercial enterprises that also deal in books and unceasingly cause these national systems to be attacked by national and European courts of law in the hope that they will one day actually collapse. That is why there is a need for a directive to create a stable economic and legal framework for present and future national systems of book price fixing, without any associated obligation on those Member States that do not want such systems. Commissioner Monti, by the way, when I was having discussions with him about this, recommended precisely this approach. He was at that time responsible for these matters and said: ‘If we, the Commission, have decided, then we should think up a directive that, so to speak, gives this decision long-term durability in the future.’ What is at issue is respect for the Member States that have decided in favour of these systems. They do so for the sake of cultural diversity. Let me give just one example of this. In any one year, more titles are published in the Federal Republic of Germany than in the United States, so let nobody try to tell us that this cultural diversity could be maintained if the national systems of price fixing were to be abolished. That is the actual reason why the Commission has to ensure that we create this economic and legal framework to enable the Member States with these systems to retain them. That is what this proposal for a directive is about. It is not about making the fixing of book prices normative throughout the European Union. That is not at all what it is about; it is about safeguarding the existing directives. Apart from that, I have set out detailed reasons why the existence of these systems alongside each other can lead to distortions of competition and why this necessitates a legal basis for the European Union to take action. (Applause)

 Mr President, I represent a minority. The new Recital 16 says that there is an obligation to report suspicions "if the legal counsellor is taking part in money laundering activities, the legal advice is provided for money laundering purposes, or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering purposes". That is going too far. That is why I am voting against this. It would destroy the integrity of advice. It also has a second implication which has not up to now been the case under our existing legislation: in all three cases the legal counsellor or lawyer would be committing a criminal offence. He would therefore also have to denounce himself. That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world. I am fairly sure that even in the Stone Age there was no law saying that. For some inexplicable reason, the Commission has felt moved for the first time ever in law to adopt a legal provision whereby one must denounce oneself. I certainly cannot vote for that. Lessing comes to mind, who said that if enlightenment is only a small light glimmering in the darkness, there is at least still some hope in the world. You have made the same mistake as with the OLAF legislation, which in the end has even penetrated into Members' offices. You will be stopped there. This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny. When we were debating the OLAF legislation, I said that the European Union as a whole had had a rush of regulatory blood to the head. We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here. I also regard it as a matter for great regret that the legal profession has shown so little backbone on this issue.
Rothley (PSE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, by and large I agree with the rapporteur, and in the limited time I have available I can only mention one or two rather unrelated points. What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation. That is very often not the case, because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts. Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law. So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts, and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this. That is one point. The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law. It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report. International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes, and as a rule, and I am choosing my words very carefully now, international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law, certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned. So if, as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce, you take issue with international civil law, the situation becomes very difficult indeed. We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law. My final point concerns national regulations. I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves. That will be very difficult. I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union.
Rothley (PSE

Mr President, I shall not speak about the subject but on the institutional issues. This House has already rejected the option of – or, at least, it has refrained from – lodging an appeal with the European Patent Office. That is only right and proper. The European Parliament is a legislative body, and as a legislative body, it cannot intervene in current proceedings. That is simply not possible! This is one of the fundamental principles of a democracy under the rule of law. The legislator passes a law – in this case, the Directive – which will be confirmed next week by the European Court of Justice. Then it will be down to the authorities to apply the Directive and award a patent or not, and the courts will have to decide whether this award or refusal of a patent is lawful. That is the due process, and no other process exists in a democracy under the rule of law. That is why the legislator – in this case, the European Parliament – cannot intervene in current proceedings. The European Parliament has about as much responsibility for this issue as the Commission, or the Green Party congress or a general meeting of Greenpeace. It is not for the Commission, or this House, or the Greens, or Greenpeace to decide how a Directive should be applied; that is the task of the relevant authorities. They – and the courts – decide on this issue, nobody else! And that is how it should be. Other than that, Ms Breyer, almost everything you said was factually incorrect.
Rothley (PSE

Mr President, naturally, I am referring to the procedure. I would like to thank the Commission for the explanation. I fully endorse its position. Please be assured that the Commission has the support of a large majority of Members of this House.
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, my group and myself, a rapporteur many years ago, are in favour of the regulation, but not because we are particularly taken with it, since what is presented to us here as a European limited liability company is incomplete. There will not be one European limited liability company, but 15 European limited liability companies. What complete disorder! I do not want to go into the details. The Council has confirmed what is common knowledge: that the Council itself is the problem when it comes to European legislation. The Council, not the Commission and not Parliament: the Council is the problem! It still wants only to decide on matters unanimously, and if there is a legal base for doing so – in this case Article 308 – all the better. So we do not need Parliament. But we will – as Mr Lehne said – very carefully consider whether this legal base is adequate, and in emergencies we shall involve the European Court of Justice in the matter. In the hands of the Council, Community law is becoming a new style of international law, with the difference and the practical advantage that it does not have to be ratified either by the European Parliament or by national parliaments. This is the strategy of the Council. Why should this European limited liability company be such an attractive prospect? Why should it be adopted? Is it not the case that this European limited liability company is threatened with the same fate as the previous company patent under the Luxembourg Convention? In this case, the Council, after many years of laborious work, also came to a compromise, and the whole of industry, all parties concerned, were not interested in it. Perhaps things will not be different with this form of European limited liability company. So what are the advantages? Why should we create a European limited liability company? What are the fiscal advantages, for example? I, for one, cannot see any. Just one more remark: It may well be that the tenth Directive concerning cross-border mergers of limited liability companies will again be unearthed after this flop, by way of a supplement as it were, because nothing will come of this European limited liability company. But hold on a minute, my friends from the Commission and the Council, nothing came, first time around, of the tenth Directive concerning cross-border mergers of limited liability companies and involving the abolition of participation, and nothing will come of it this time! Now that we have come to grips with the European limited liability company as it were, I would like to remind you that other company forms are next on the list: the European association, the European mutual society and the European cooperative. I hope that the Commission lays down proposals on these matters in the near future.

Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor, despite the fact that I have not yet written a book and have not read a great many. The protection of intellectual property has always been a cause for concern to the European Union and to the European Parliament, because we know that only this protection guarantees that we have culture, that culture flourishes and that economic production takes place. This could have been an historic moment for the European Parliament. But it is not. For the first time in our lives, the protection of intellectual property is being undermined. With the consent of the European Parliament. As we have found out, the European Parliament still has only one objective: no conciliation. After 18 months of deliberation in the Council, we have been told to get a move on. After 18 months of deliberation in the Council. And then the Council says "unanimously", although it could have voted by a qualified majority, given the balance we keep hearing about. And then Parliament is asked not to make any more amendments. We might just as well shut up shop and go home. I have never seen Members put under such pressure by their governments and parties. But with the Council and the governments on either side, in the Council and in Parliament, what need is there for Parliament? Parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it. The common position has dramatically undermined authors' rights. I am on the authors' side and I call on Parliament to restore these rights – at least to some degree.
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, I must, and can, be brief. This week we are able, for the first time, to adopt a European Union legislative act which has been drawn up on the initiative of the European Parliament and on which, thank God, the Commission and the Council have cooperated positively. It is about improved protection for accident victims in the European Union. This directive resolves a large number of the problems which usually arise when people are involved in an accident in another country. First of all, however, and before looking back, I wish to take a look into the future. Commissioner Bolkestein, a draft fifth directive already exists. I have drawn it up and it will soon be put before Parliament. I very much hope that we will also be able to cooperate closely on this issue. The fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline. At the beginning of June – this is also part of our glance into the future – we will be holding a conference at the Academy of European Law in Trier on another important issue, the reform of personal injury, and this may give rise to a further parliamentary initiative. As you can see, we wish this debate on improved protection for accident victims to gain a certain momentum. I would be very grateful to you in particular, Commissioner, if we could achieve this together. I would be grateful to you because you made an important contribution – and this is where I start to look back – to the debate on the fourth directive. You see there was the major problem of deciding whether this directive ought to apply when the accident had taken place in a Member State of the European Union. I have never understood why the Commission initially fought against this so stubbornly; its stance could not be justified from a logical, political or legal point of view. Then, thankfully, when we discussed this in Parliament at the end of last year, you prepared the ground for us to make this possible. This directive will now apply in all countries which are members of the green card system, meaning that approximately 90% of all accidents in which Europeans might be involved will be covered. And while I am on the subject of figures, we are talking about approximately 500 000 accidents a year in the European Union alone – not counting third countries – where we will be able to settle claims much more easily in the future. In the past there was the problem that people had to cope with a foreign language, foreign laws and so on. Sometimes the process dragged on for ages. When I look at the petitions which have been sent to the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle, I am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward. Obviously, we cannot in any way change either the law which has to be applied or the legal jurisdiction, but by now proposing a system whereby each insurer has a claims representative in every other country, we will probably be able, as far as the accident victim is concerned, satisfactorily to settle the claims arising from 90% of all traffic accidents which take place in another country. That is a very big step forward. When we debated this, some questions were still open. I did, and I would just mention this point, rather regret the fact that the compensation bodies – and these were, after all, the Commission’s idea – were gradually watered down during the political consultation process. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, we did find a solution which is satisfactory, but in three to four years’ time we will review what this directive has achieved and, if necessary, propose improvements. In conclusion, I should like to say that thanks to your intervening, Commissioner, important progress has been made on this directive, and I should specifically like to thank you for that. You overcame resistance from within your own Commission. This was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it. I hope that, where the protection of accident victims and its improvement is concerned, we will also enjoy fruitful cooperation in the future.
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, I would thank the Commission for its statement and would urge it to file an official objection to this patent. The Council should give the Commission the mandate to do this. In justification of this, I would point out that it must be the Commission’s job to enforce the directive on bio-patents. It is debatable whether this directive, for which I was the rapporteur, is in fact a suitable tool for managing the problems involved. It would have been helpful if whoever was giving vent to his indignation had taken the trouble to read the patent. He would then have seen that the patent infringes the directive on bio-patents on two counts, firstly because the patent protection extends to include a procedure for modifying human genetic material and, secondly, because the patent protection extends to include the use of embryos for commercial and industrial purposes. These are two clear infringements of the directive on bio-patents.  How one might now use this as an opportunity to again cast doubt upon the directive without having read the patent or the directive, I really cannot imagine. Hence, my request to Parliament to the effect that we should not again cast doubt upon the directive, as Mrs Breyer thinks we have to. This is, in fact, the first text in the world to offer a satisfactory solution to the problems involved in patent protection and bio-technological inventions and, what is more, the first text in the world to win universal approval. It is now, therefore, a question not of again bringing the directive into question but of enforcing it.

Mr President, Mr Harbour’s interpretation is correct. The text should in fact be translated in English as “without delay”. For the rest, I would ask for a vote in favour. The conciliation procedure is unavoidable. But I am highly confident that we will find a compromise on the basis of the Commission’s explanation yesterday.
Rothley (PSE
),  
rapporteur.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, it all sounded so terribly technical in your announcement, but in reality this legislation significantly improves the protection of those who are victims of a road accident in another country. I mention this because we are obviously no longer capable of expressing ourselves in such a way that people can understand what we are talking about. We can be proud of this directive. It is a joint effort on the part of the European Parliament, which took the initiative, but also the Commission which improved the original Parliament proposal considerably with the addition of the compensation body. We can, however, also be grateful to the Council for accepting the essential points contained in the proposal. As far as the recommendations for the second reading are concerned, I should like to concentrate on two points. The vast majority of the amendments concern drafting points and the legal text itself. Parts of the Council's common position are virtually incomprehensible. I am even convinced that the authors themselves do not know what on earth they have written. I should like to remind both the Commission and the Council of a very fine quotation from a 19th century German jurist, who said that the legislator must think like a philosopher and speak like a farmer, simply and clearly and so that people can understand. The artistry involved in trying to find a compromise is usually reflected in the legislation, and the principle of speaking simply and clearly becomes out of the question. Admittedly, there remains a problem of substance, where we in the European Parliament hold a different opinion from that of the Commission and the Council. I should like to remind the Commission and the Council that in this matter we have the support of the profession, the insurers, who incidentally are the ones affected by the provisions of the whole directive. We also have the support of the automobile associations and we have the support of the organisations of accident victims. The only people in the whole world who still oppose this are the Commission and the Council. What is it about? It is about this directive also applying if the accident has not taken place in a Member State of the EU but in a third country. There is not the slightest reason for excluding this case from the scope of the directive. Let us take the example of a Frenchman and an Italian who have an accident in Switzerland. Why should the directive not apply in this case? Why not indeed? The insurers shake their heads and say that of course it can be done. There is one insurance company which disagrees – a British company – but all the others are asking, why not? By adopting this directive, we are not making any changes to substantive law, we are not in any way changing the court of jurisdiction, we are not in any way changing judicial procedures. The one and only difference is that the accident victim from France – to use the same example – does not have to contact the Italian insurance company in Italy directly but the representative of the Italian insurance company in France. That is all. Wherever the accident has happened – for example in Switzerland – any further procedures, if there is no agreement, are not affected one jot by this directive. It only regulates the settlement of disputes before they reach the courts, not in court. Commissioner, that is why I am making this request. Clearly specific interests have been at work here. It was even claimed by the Commission in a trialogue that European insurers were against my solution. The truth is different. They are in favour of this solution. Hence my recommendation, Commissioner: I urge the Commission to rethink its position. It is untenable. I assume that the Council would then also accept this solution. I wish to emphasise once more that this is not a proposal which has been dreamt up in a bureaucratic ivory tower. This proposal is the result of countless discussions with all of those involved. That is also why I think that it is practicable, because those who have to deal with it in practice are after all telling us that it works, it works extremely well, and that is what they want. Usually the Commission takes account of the interests of those involved. Ask those involved then, and you will see that the solution proposed by the European Parliament meets with their approval. There is, therefore, no reason for the scope of this directive to be restricted. This is in fact only to the detriment of accident victims. We should not forget that! Surely what we want is to improve the protection of accident victims. That is why I make this plea: we should all reconsider this matter in the forthcoming conciliation procedure.
Rothley (PSE

 Mr President, the result has come about after a whole series of infringements of the law. The provisions of the Rules of Procedure have been infringed on many occasions by the departments and by the majority of the Parliament. Moreover, the result is a black day for the Parliament, because through it, what the majority of the Parliament has decided, the Parliament becomes an authority and the Members officials. I shall, however, not let my own Parliament make me into an official. If I think about it, the fact that the Members of Parliament according to this text are bound to assist in the work of OLAF and if they are moreover obliged to inform on people, then such a rule affects the independent mandate most profoundly. I should like to state that such a decision that destroys the parliamentary system can clearly not be accepted but that we, and not myself alone, but many others too, will submit this matter to the European Court of Justice.

Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteurs, the Committee on Budgets will not take seriously the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is applauding it for its work! The Committee on Budgets has let down the European Court of Justice, as has the Council! I know that in the political process law is frequently considered irritating. However, to disregard in such a way the work of the European Court of Justice on European integration and legal protection of the individual is verging on scandalous! The question arises as to what role a specialised committee should continue to play when the Committee on Budgets, in a generous gesture, simply sweeps all the carefully considered, moderate proposals from the table? So what role should specialised committees continue to play? I fear that legal protection in this European Union will continue to be limited. It is all too clear who is responsible for this. We should not expose ourselves to the danger of limiting legal protection in the European Union, not least when we constantly talk of wanting to create an area of freedom, security and justice.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as rapporteur for the rules governing Members of Parliament, I would like to make a couple of observations. In December 1998, the European Parliament adopted a statute with a qualified majority, a decision which was confirmed in May of this year by an overwhelming majority. We therefore have a statute, all that is now required is the approval of the Council. It is not enough that the Council submits an alternative draft. That is no solution. I would like to remind you that the European Commission has unequivocally approved the statute of the European Parliament. Permit me to make a few observations regarding the principles which will govern our actions. One thing is for sure; this statute will not be drawn up by the press, be it the Swedish press, the British press, the Dutch press or that of any other country. Not even the highly regarded French daily Libération
































































 will write this statute, nor shall we allow ourselves to be governed by a statute produced by civil servants. We are not children who can be taken to task; we shall not be harassed by civil servants. Therefore, I would recommend that the Finnish Presidency gently shelves the Council document. We will not place ourselves in the Babylonian Captivity of the Council. We will preserve the Parliament"s autonomy and reject any type of guardianship over the Parliament. (Applause)  We shall make constructive proposals to the Finnish Presidency. I look forward to initial talks taking place at the beginning of September. My request to the Finnish Presidency is that the talks, which will be necessary, be conducted at the highest possible political level. In this way, I believe the success we are after will be achieved as soon as possible. Mr President, we are pinning high hopes on the Finnish Presidency. We are also pinning our hopes on the Finnish Presidency as far as the European Parliament"s involvement in drawing up the catalogue of fundamental rights is concerned. The Council cannot seriously be considering the option that only two members of Parliament collaborate on this catalogue of fundamental rights. Without a minimum of 15 delegates, an imbalance will exist between the European Parliament and the national Members of Parliament, where such a balance is required. (Applause)
