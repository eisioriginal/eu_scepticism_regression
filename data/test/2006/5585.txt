A fortnight ago the European Parliament adopted a report on a common immigration policy for Europe, thus paving the way for what had already been planned by the European Commission: mass immigration. Today it is the turn of asylum seekers; the idea is to establish a ‘Europe of asylum’. Indeed, the clearly stated objective is to ensure higher standards of treatment for asylum seekers with regard to their reception conditions. That means not only standardising minimum reception conditions among all the Member States but also providing support for asylum seekers to settle in huge numbers. To this end, the scope of this future directive will be extended to all persons legally or illegally entering European Union territory. The administrative restrictions that exist in the Member States with regard to labour market access will have to be completely abolished. Social, medical, psychological and housing assistance, as well as legal assistance, will have to be provided by the hosting Member State. Refusal of such assistance will be subject to legal appeals and investigations…that is often not the case for nationals themselves … By adopting this second phase of the ‘asylum package’, Brussels is facilitating and encouraging global immigration to Europe. We shall always oppose this internationalist vision, the sole aim of which is purely and simply to destroy the peoples and nations of Europe.

Under the guise of combating mafia organisations and organised crime in general, the Eurocrats of Brussels wish to further impose their federalist views, which destroy nations, peoples and identities. Indeed, while everyone knows that each EU Member State has its own laws, legal traditions, and codes, here we have yet another assault by these fanatical Euro-federalists, in the shape of their desire to create a ‘European judicial culture’. In order to establish this culture, the following should accordingly be created: a European Judicial School, an academy of European law for judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, and all others involved in the administration of justice. What about national judicial schools? What about the inextricable differences between the legislations deriving from common law and those from written law? No answer is given, obviously. In practice, it will be the entire judicial and penal systems of the Member States that will disappear in the face of this forced harmonisation – downwards harmonisation, that is. These sorcerer’s apprentices of Europe’s have not understood a thing; only the nation states, Europe’s main components, will be able to enrich it and to restore it to its rightful place in the world. Europe must not be built at the expense of its nations and its peoples.

 By affirming that animals must be slaughtered without unnecessary suffering, except in the case of religious rites, the majority of our House has demonstrated both its hypocrisy and its cowardice. ‘Religious rites’ mainly refer to the ritual slaughter practised in particular during the Muslim festival of Eid-al-Adha, when hundreds of thousands of sheep have their throats cut. Legal recognition of such a practice is part of a much wider phenomenon, that of the Islamisation of our societies. Our laws and customs are changing progressively to accommodate Islamic Sharia law. In France, more and more local authorities are indirectly funding the construction of mosques. School menus are drawn up to meet Islamic dietary requirements. In some cities, such as Lille, the swimming pools have women­only sessions. By creating the Conseil français du culte musulman
 in 2003, Mr Sarkozy, then Minister of the Interior, introduced Islam into France’s institutions. To put an end to these developments, we have to reject the Islamically correct, reverse the flow of non­European migration and create a new Europe, a Europe of sovereign nations, without Turkey, affirming the Christian and humanist values of its civilisation.

The report by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou recommends rejecting the Commission’s proposal for amending a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities. I voted in favour of this report, which seeks to reject a proposal by the European Commission that will not make it possible to remedy the failings identified in the implementation and monitoring of the rules in relation to driving times and rest periods directly linked to safety and social rights. Furthermore, there is no clarification as to the scope of this directive and possible ways of monitoring. In any case, Member States must assume sole responsibility in this area. Finally, this proposal does not define any better the notion of ‘mobile workers’ or ‘self-employed drivers’, and with good reason, since this is where the real challenge of this directive lies. Should we exclude all self-employed drivers from this directive? The question remains open, because the problem is complex. Indeed, there exists a widespread practice of drivers working as ‘false’ self-employed drivers, when they are in fact employed by companies which, for reasons of profitability, bypass the rules in relation to driving times and rest periods.

Mr President, ‘to err is human, to persist is diabolical’. Hearing the debates today, all I can say is that actually, despite the huge economic, financial, social, and demographic impact of the crisis we are experiencing, neither the European institutions nor the Heads of State or Government have grasped the full extent of the tragedy, and of the consequences for us all. A minute ago, I heard the President-in-Office of the Council telling us that the unemployed need to be able to improve their skills, and that we need to motivate people more in their search for jobs. Do you really believe though, that the hundreds of thousands of unemployed victims of this crisis are in this situation because they are unfit to work? All of this is quite clearly the fruit of an ideological and doctrinal choice, of a kind of group thinking, of economic theory, which is the economic theory of the free market and free trade. Finally, the European Union, which promotes the concept of freedom of movement of capital, goods, services and persons, would like to globalise this economic choice, this doctrine; however this is economically and socially criminal. We need to achieve global international competition. If we are not capable of implementing a policy of social preference via economic preference, a policy of social security via economic security, if we are not capable of implementing a trade protection policy, well then, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to deliver what remains of our farmers, our craftsmen and our industries to the law of the globalisation jungle. Within this House, there are the liberal globalists, the socio-globalists, and the alter-globalists. I am proud to be amongst the anti-globalists, those who want to win back the internal market, those who want to apply the rule of national and Community preference, and the rule of national and Community protection, in order to serve our people.

In 2008, 165 trawlers were scrapped. In 2009, it has already been announced that 225 will go. The fisheries sector in France is suffering greatly because the French Government and Brussels have decided to sacrifice French fishermen for the sake of European economic and trade policy. Thus, Norway, a country outside the European Union, but which has negotiated gas-related economic agreements with the latter, awards itself alone 80% of the cod quota, a figure amounting to 500 000 tonnes per year. France, for its part, has access to only 9 000 tonnes per year, of which only 700 tonnes come from the English Channel and the North Sea. How, under these circumstances, can one fail to feel disgust at witnessing the eradication of French fishermen? Why are Brussels and the French Government thus striving to plot the destruction of an entire sector of our economy? Euro-globalist interests and the dogma of free trade are why. It is not the EUR 4 million envelope promised by the minister for agriculture and fisheries, intended as financial compensation linked to the stopping of boats that have reached their quota of fish, that will solve this problem. There is an urgent, crucial need to free French fishermen from these discriminating and destructive European quotas.

A common immigration policy based on facilitating the opening up of legal immigration channels cannot receive our support. The policy should be the polar opposite of this. This report is based, once again, on the dangerous recommendations of the Commission that appear in the latter’s Green Paper of 11 January 2005 devoted to economic migration. It is a report that puts the number of migrant workers that the EU will supposedly need by 2050 at 60 million and that accordingly stresses the need to open up channels for legal migration. How can one fail to find it obscene that, in the midst of an economic, financial and social crisis, we are being recommended to open up our markets further to foreign workers, at a time when our national jobs are under threat and unemployment is raging? In the midst of a crisis, what is needed, instead, is to apply economic and social protectionist measures and to reserve jobs, but social aid too, for nationals. To conclude, this report is based on the false assumption that, by opening the floodgates for legal immigration, illegal immigration will fall considerably or disappear altogether. We know that no such thing will happen and that, on the contrary, legal immigration is the forerunner of full-scale immigration.

 Since 2000, the European Union has continually promoted equality, and this increasingly in the broadest possible sense of the word: equality between men and women, between nationals and foreigners, between the sick and the healthy, between Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists and other religions, equality of access to education, to health, equality for one’s sexual orientation, and so on. In short, the list is evidently not exhaustive, and the European directives currently being drafted concern equal access to social services and housing. Here then is a new directive that, under the guise of the legitimate fight against discrimination towards disabled people, is intended to regulate, or rather shackle, almost every area in which the freedom of choice, be it contractual or otherwise, still exists. The pitfalls in such a coercive regulation are legion. In effect, these new European measures will not only increase European bureaucracy and burdens, but will also be a real threat to other fundamental freedoms and rights including, in particular, freedom of worship, of association and of expression, and freedom of the press. In the name of equality, the censors and the dictators are here present.

 Unlike Turkey, Russia forms part of the geographical, cultural and spiritual sphere and therefore civilisation of Europe. It should therefore be an ideal strategic partner in many areas, especially energy. However, it is also a sister nation that we should support and not criticise unendingly, as many right-thinking ultra-Europeans do, especially in this report, which calls the rescue of the Russian-speaking minorities in Georgia a ‘disproportionate counter-attack’ that ‘puts a question mark on Russia’s readiness to build, together with the EU, a common space of security in Europe’. The ultra-Europeans who are always ready to align themselves with the United States and their war in Iraq have nothing to teach the Russians. Ten years ago, these same ultra-European human rights types did not hesitate to support NATO in its unspeakable act of aggression against Serbia. We are calling for a new Europe to be built, a free Europe of sovereign nations that will establish privileged relations with Russia.

Internet use and development are without doubt a source of important progress, especially where freedom of expression and democracy are concerned. Striking a balance between such freedom, the protection of privacy and the need for Internet security represents a real challenge for us all. This is particularly the case where political action is concerned. Indeed, some people on the opposition side or who may hold controversial political views do not have access to the various media and see in the Internet an opportunity to convey their message throughout the world. Such freedom should not be censored. China, Cuba and Burma, as true totalitarian states, have no hesitation in gagging such freedom of expression by systematically censoring and filtering information with contempt for all the principles of democracy and freedom. Internet filtering for the sake of combating pornography, child pornography and terrorism is crucial, but such vigilance must be strictly defined and controlled.

 Madam President, between 2007 and 2013, cohesion policy will be the main item of expenditure for the Europe of Brussels, but far from benefiting the French regions, this development actually penalises them. The increase in regional expenditure is in fact made at the expense of the common agricultural policy, and therefore at the expense of France. We can see that the share allocated to the French regions is continually shrinking. The vast majority of the EUR 347 billion in Structural Funds is to be given to Eastern Europe, destroyed by more than 40 years of communism. Already in the year 2000, Brussels withdrew the Structural Funds granted under the former Objective I from the cantons of France’s Hainaut region. Today France, which contributes 16% of European budget revenue, is giving more and more but receiving less and less. What is more, this regional aid has not protected those affected by the world economic crisis because it forms part of the ultra-liberal philosophy of the Lisbon Strategy. Now more than ever, we need to build a new Europe that will at last provide economic protection for our regions and our nations through an active policy of reassuming control of our internal market.

 Mr President, globalisation gone mad and its mad exponents are making European automotive workers pay a high price for the consequences of their fundamentalist open-market and free-trade order. The financial virus of the US mortgage crisis has thus been able freely to contaminate the financial system, the world banking system, leading by extension to the contamination of our economic system and the destruction of our businesses and jobs. As a Member, together with my colleague Mr Le Rachinel, for the French regions of Picardy, Nord-Pas de Calais and Normandy, in which thousands of jobs are doomed, I am anxious to tell you that European trade policies have a human and social cost that is unbearable, unjustifiable and unacceptable. However, the fanatics of the open market persist and sign up to this. Only today, Mr Brown and Mr Barroso reaffirmed their refusal to protect Europe, our industries and our jobs in the name of the all-important free market and globalisation. The socio-globalists of the left, the liberal globalists of the right and the alter-globalists of the extreme left who want to see and understand nothing are betraying and abandoning European workers. Globalists all over the world unite! Workers of our countries disappear! That is the manifesto of the globalist party. Moreover, the continuous harassment of motorists and the motor car by eco-citizens, governments and certain local councillors is scarcely compatible with the defence and promotion of our automotive industries. Finally, the demagogues of the extreme left who see the current crisis as a godsend for the revolution are totally incapable of meeting the needs of French and European workers. It is through economic and social patriotism, national and European preference and national and European protection that we will be able to breathe new life into our industrial sectors.

It is a known fact that Europe wants to take care of everything and be everywhere. With this resolution on migrant children left behind in the country of origin, the European Parliament has reached the height of madness with proposals which are not only demagogic, but also aim at turning the Member States into the guilty parties. We are told that the Union has paid insufficient attention to the phenomenon of children left behind in their countries when their parents migrate. The Member States should implement measures aimed at improving the situation of these children left behind and guarantee them normal development, in terms of their education and social life. It is like being in a dream! After the measures encouraging the reuniting of families in the receiving countries and right of abode for the families themselves, now it is time for measures for the children who do not migrate. The problem of immigration will not be solved like this. The logic is wrong. It is not the children who stay behind who should be helped; it is the families and the entire populations from these countries who should be helped and encouraged to stay at home.

The worthy sentiments propounded by the different political groups, with the notable exception of the Communists (and with just cause), is merely an echo of the political correctness spouted by the hippies of international show business. The cause of Tibet, the real liberation struggle, has been throttled by the stranglehold of trendy Europeans short on spirituality. It is a prime example of what not to do in internal and international policy. The Members wish to condemn with the utmost politeness the exactions of the Chinese Communists whilst declaring themselves in favour of autonomy for a region which is not the historic Tibet. The idea of autonomy for Tibet, the ‘Save Tibet’ path, is just waving a leash in front of an impotent elite and a people which has been slaughtered, both spiritually and physically. Tibet, like other oppressed nations, shows what happens when a Communist dictatorship is installed and the weapon of invasive immigration is used to prevent any going back, be it on a political, ethnic, cultural or spiritual level. Tibet has without a doubt missed its chance of regaining its sovereignty by not keeping up the armed struggle following the exile of its leader. The road to follow now is one of a fight for independence, for ‘Free Tibet’, and not one of slavery perpetuated under the guise of a paper ‘autonomy’.

Eight legislative texts making up a maritime package have just been adopted in the European Parliament. We welcome this because the package covers not only passenger compensation, but also inspections, State inspection of ports, investigations into transport accidents and the choice of the authority able to decide on the place of refuge for vessels in distress. The ball is now in the Member States’ court because it is not enough to legislate: this legislation needs to be transposed into their national laws. The first test will be to monitor the flags of convenience belonging to European countries. These flags are used to bypass the union, tax, recruitment, safety and environmental regulations of the countries to which the vessels really belong. Cyprus and Malta are still today among the top five flags of convenience in terms of the number of vessels lost. It is unfortunately notable that, despite the efforts made since the oil tankers Prestige
 and Erika
 sank, the situation has hardly improved. Substandard vessels sailing under flags of convenience are slashing transport prices. The so-called rich countries are responding by creating their own (mark II) flag to combat the loss of freight. In reality, if we are truly to get rid of these floating wrecks, the European Union must set about fighting ultra-liberalism.

It is remarkable that this report should admit several failures by the European Union on social issues. There is firstly the admission that the Lisbon Strategy objectives will not be achieved in 2010. Then, there are some interesting figures on the growing rate of unemployment, which rose from 7% in 2008 to 8.7% in 2009 and, more specifically, from 7.5% to 9.2% in the eurozone. In other words, there is a forecast loss of 3.5 million jobs. This painful observation should make the pro-Europeans think about the radical reforms needed at Member State level to limit as much as possible the disastrous consequences of the economic and financial crisis, a crisis which originated in the ultra-liberalism and globalisation that are so dear to Brussels. To this end, it is not credible to pursue a policy such as this aimed at maintaining guidelines for the Member States’ employment policies. On the contrary, we need to call into question this authoritarian logic and give the States back control of their economic and financial resources, whilst introducing national and Community preference and protection, which would enable the recovery of the internal market and a return to growth.

Madam President, I have one minute to say to you that, despite the determination and the blindness of the European institutions, one thing should be obvious to everyone: the time has come to put an end to Turkey’s accession process. Negotiations have become bogged down, there is a mutual lack of understanding and a permanent state of ambiguity. This situation is detrimental to all – to the European Union as well as to Turkey. We have to stop the hypocrisy and the pretence. We must remember one obvious fact. Turkey is a country in Asia Minor. Turkey is not a European country, either geographically or culturally. Turkey is militarily occupying a part of a Member State of the European Union since, to this day, we have only ten negotiating chapters out of 35 and only one has been closed. It is time for everyone to regain their freedom, independence and sovereignty, starting with Cyprus. The people of Europe do not want Turkey in Europe. Let us respect our people and show respect for Europe!

 Such a rare event deserves to be highlighted. This own-initiative report on the future of the management of the EU’s external borders is a reasonable one, and it is tinged with a degree of realism in that it proposes, as a first stage in re-examining border management in the EU, a critical, in-depth analysis of the operation and effectiveness of the existing systems and how they interact. Without being gullible, we can be optimistic, and then perhaps we can have a debate. Just as an example, to help us understand the state of mind of the authors of this text, here are two passages from it. The first recognises that ‘striking a balance between ensuring the free movement of a growing number of people across borders and ensuring greater security for Europe’s citizens is a complex exercise…’. That much is true, but in another place we read that ‘measures to enhance border security must go hand in hand with facilitation of passenger flows and the promotion of mobility in an increasingly globalised world’. This level of schizophrenia is quite beyond us.

 In reality, there is only one objective behind this desire to create a common European asylum system, namely to give the Member States of the European Union the legal option of receiving as many potential immigrants as possible, more easily and without restrictions, which were deemed to be useless and contrary to human rights. Europe has thus reaffirmed its position as a host for all migrant populations, and considerable emphasis has been placed on full respect for the principle of non-refoulement and on the duty to render assistance as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Hence – and this is indeed understandable for these pro-immigration types – the simple fact that each Member State still has sovereignty and its own procedures in asylum law inevitably leads to disparities in the acceptance of asylum applications and is thus a barrier to the general acceptance of asylum applicants. Faced with almost 26 million internally displaced persons and more than 12 million refugees in the world, what we need to do is not find more reception solutions, because it will never be enough to deal with the exponential growth in demand, but rather allow and encourage these people to stay in their own countries, to find work there and to base their families there.

Although this report is interesting on a number of points and sketches out a battle plan against illegal immigration, it contains some enormous stumbling-blocks. There are no specific measures to protect the internal and external borders of the Union. There are no measures in relation to the policy of expelling illegal immigrants back to their country of origin. It simply defines a person who has entered the territory of the Union illegally as an illegal immigrant who has rights. In reality, European institutions are embarrassed by this issue. On the one hand, in the name of security and justice, they are demanding a minimum of European rules to curb illegal immigration and, on the other, in the name of their rules that have become dogma – those of ultraliberalism and of freedom of movement – they want the territory of the Union to become a place for receiving and attracting millions of prospective immigrants. We reject this philosophy that is dangerous for the people and nations of Europe. We reassert their right to defend themselves and to remain themselves.

When it comes to the rights granted to migrants on European Union territory, the rule is certainly one of giving more and more. The question must be asked as to whether the one-upmanship within the European institutions is not misplaced. This report is merely a long list of proposals and recommendations aimed at the Member States so that they grant to the hundreds of thousands of people who each year enter their territory legally or illegally rights that are not only equal to those of their nationals, but also more numerous and effective. Indeed, the Member States of the Union are, for instance, being called on to remove the barriers to labour market access for these immigrants and to adopt national laws which, moreover, promote such access. Must one conclude from this that, from now on, nationals will have to step aside in favour of the legitimate suffering of people fleeing their countries of origin, be it for economic, political, climatic or family reasons? Yes, and this is the meaning of selective immigration, which President Sarkozy wholeheartedly recommends. In contrast to this, we believe – particularly in times of crisis – that jobs, in Europe, should be reserved for Europeans, and, in France, for French nationals. The national recovery of the European nations depends on it.

 This report has various merits. The first is that it has an educational objective. It establishes the alarming fact of the increase in illegal immigration in Europe, immigration estimated at between 4.5 and 8 million according to the Commission’s own figures, and it specifies the sectors of the economy where illegal labour is most concentrated: construction, agriculture, cleaning, hotels and restaurants. The second is that it intensifies the fight against moonlighting, in particular by introducing financial and criminal penalties for employers of illegal immigrants. Unfortunately, the limits to this report are also numerous. There is nothing about measures to stop these intermittent floods of illegal immigration. The re-establishment of internal border controls is not even being considered. Furthermore, in times of social and economic crisis and sharply rising unemployment, the prime necessity for the countries of the European Union is to protect their jobs, and so it is essential to implement national and European policies of social protectionism. We must reserve jobs for French people in France and for Europeans in Europe. It is a question of applying the principles of national and European preference and protection as essential conditions for the economic and social recovery of the countries of the European Union.

 This report has various merits. Its first is that it aims to be informative: it records the alarming facts of the growth of illegal immigration in Europe, immigration estimated, according to the Commission’s own figures, at between 4.5 and 8 million people. It also identifies those sectors of the economy in which illegal working is most concentrated, namely, construction, agriculture, cleaning, hotels and catering. Its second merit is that it intensifies the fight against undeclared work, particularly with the option of financial and penal sanctions for employers of illegal workers. Unfortunately, the report has many limitations. It says nothing on what measures should be taken to stem these intermittent flows of illegal immigration. It does not even consider the reintroduction of checks at internal borders. In a time of both social and economic crisis and a big rise in unemployment, the first requirement for the countries of the Union is to protect their jobs. To do so, it is essential to introduce national and European social protection policies. Jobs in France must be reserved for the French, while jobs in Europe are reserved for Europeans. Application of the principles of national and European preference and protection is an essential condition for economic and social recovery in the countries of the European Union.

The content of the report on budgetary control of EU funds in Afghanistan once again shows that interventionism by the West in these regions has changed nothing. Our presence only prolongs the war and the resulting suffering, rather than eliminating them. To talk of democracy and the equality of the sexes in a country where customs sometimes border on barbarism, is typical of the blissful ignorance of ultra-Europeans who still prefer to get involved in international issues rather than dealing with Europe’s problems. The ethnic groups in Afghanistan, where wars have raged for centuries, will never accept any foreign occupation, no matter how ‘humanitarian’. It only strengthens the positions of the Taliban and other extremist factions, rather than enabling a strong and capable legitimate power to emerge and stabilise the country. Europeans must withdraw as quickly as possible from the Afghan wasps’ nest.

The text tabled by all the groups in this assembly, which is intended to represent the interests of European peoples, does indeed contain some excellent recommendations, such as a call for the fighting to stop, but it does not make any reference to the importing of this conflict into Europe. As well as their concomitant violence, two images from the demonstrations against the Israeli intervention were particularly shocking. One was of the demonstrators, the majority of whom were immigrants, brandishing Palestinian, Algerian, Hamas and Hezbollah flags, and banners with inscriptions in Arabic. The other was of the French extreme-left leaders, Besancenot from the Revolutionary Communist League, and Buffet from the Communist Party, marching with the imams. These images illustrate two worrying developments: the gradual takeover of the immigrant masses from the Muslim world by Islamist associations and the collusion between Islamist movements and the extreme communist left, two revolutionary movements who seek to destroy our civilisation. Now more than ever, the safeguarding of the identity and freedom of the European people demands that such demonstrations be banned and a policy implemented to reverse migratory flows.

Entrusting a report such as this to a communist Member is a provocation for the hundreds of millions of victims of communism. In this report Mr Catania is inspired, it is true, by an ideology less brutal than communism, but just as totalitarian: euro-internationalism. His text in fact denies the most fundamental human rights: – the right to life, with the promotion of abortion and euthanasia; – the right of each child to have a father and a mother, by calling on the States to apply the ‘principle of mutual recognition for homosexual couples, whether they are married or living in a registered civil partnership’; – the right of European nations to self-determination and to remain as they are, flouted by proposals aimed at opening up Europe even more to global immigration – a development to which the nationals of our countries are meant to adapt; – and democracy, since the report claims to adhere to the Treaty of Lisbon, which was rejected by the Irish electorate. Now more than ever, safeguarding our freedoms and the identity of our nations requires a new Europe to be built, the Europe of free and sovereign nations.

 There is no question for anyone acquainted with the arcane mysteries of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council that seeking access to information on the European Union’s institutions remains a journey full of pitfalls for the average citizen. There are many reasons for this. Indeed, it is just as much a question of the huge number of documents issued and the countless forms in which they are published (reports, opinions, resolutions, directives, regulations, and so on), as it is of the lack of simplification and clarity of the institutional registers and of the web pages and the lack of transparency and communication. This report rightly proposes resolving these kinds of problems by ensuring that the European institutions are more transparent. Indeed, this forms part of the wider issue of increasing the part played by citizens of the Union in the way in which the latter operates and understands matters. The peoples of Europe do not want systematically to be excluded from decisions that have a direct bearing on their everyday lives and in relation to which they have no right to inspect or to object. On the rare occasions when they have had their voices heard by referendum, they have disowned their leaders and Brussels bureaucracy, which is blind, deaf and unresponsive to their needs and wants. Making the European institutions more transparent is a first step towards a new Europe, a Europe of the peoples and a Europe of the sovereign nations.

 Impact studies carried out by French technical institutes and centres show that the draft revision of the European directive on pesticides could lead to the disappearance of many products currently on the market. It is important that this draft gives farmers in the Union the means to protect their crops. Without this, crop production will fall off markedly and there could also be a noticeable impact on livestock production. Entire agricultural sectors could be condemned in France and in Europe and the very role of agriculture, which is to feed our citizens with healthy and varied produce, would be threatened. Without questioning the need to protect consumers and users, the new regulation must not threaten innovation or the diversity of chemical families. It must therefore immediately include alternative solutions. This is the only solution to avoid the migration of a large amount of agricultural production and the jobs and wealth that go with it. Faced with these crucial challenges for farmers, as the producers of vegetables, fruit and cereals, we need to remain vigilant in the face of the current reforms and the measures taken to apply them at national level.

In recital B of this report it is written that ‘illegal immigration is a common European challenge’. Indeed, this is all the more true since, each month, illegal immigrants in search of a European Eldorado disembark on the Italian, Greek and Spanish coasts in their thousands. In the face of this challenge which, let us not forget, is principally a product of the Schengen Agreements – which abolished the controls at the internal border of the Member States – the Union’s response has been to create a European external border control agency: Frontex. Only yesterday just a gimmick without resources, personnel or power, it would seem that, today, Frontex’s remit allows it to provide its support to joint return operations and contributes in some, albeit small, way to the daily fight against illegal immigration. We should keep in mind, however, that there is no use in closing a few gaps allowing illegal immigrants to pass through if all the EU Member States do not react as one to denounce the Schengen Agreements and to re-establish real controls at all their borders, both on land and at sea.

This report concerning the cross-border use and the recognition of authentic acts presents risks of confusion in a variety of ways. Indeed, and above all, it should be specified that the concept of the authentic act does not exist in common law systems. In England and Wales, solicitors fulfil the role of notaries. There are also scrivener notaries. The latter cannot issue authentic acts and are only authorised to certify signatures. In its concern to harmonise the legal professions, the Commission attaches little importance to the differences relating to the very nature of the Member States’ legal systems. Unfortunately this political will does not contribute to legal certainty as a whole. Europe must protect the identity of its peoples and the values and traditions peculiar to each of its States. The biggest mistake would be for it to develop in a way that is detrimental to its peoples.

 The European Commission’s draft directive on working time, often criticised then rejected in 2005, was clearly an ultraliberal and internationalist tool, all the aspects of which formed an antisocial arsenal that could result in abuses, in particular, with the opt-out principle, which allows the maximum weekly working time of 48 hours to be exceeded. A worker could be called on to work up to 78 hours per week. Mr Cercas’s report seems to have attempted to reach an acceptable compromise. As amended, it is intended to be, above all, a political message aimed at European workers and unions. Conversely, it makes absolutely no mention of the problems faced in other professions when working time is reduced excessively, as with 35 hours. This applies particularly to health professions: hospitals, emergency services and so on. The issue of regulating working time and the freedom to work longer or shorter hours calls for a response that goes beyond a neo-Marxist or ultraliberal ideology, in favour of a more pragmatic and realistic approach. While this recommendation is meant to be reassuring, while its aim is to ensure the health and safety of European workers and to enable them to reconcile family life … (The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)

 The taxation, penalisation and systematic swindling of motorists seems to know no bounds. We know, in reality, that this is not a matter of penalising those who drive badly, but those who drive frequently. The sad and unfortunate obligation on police to meet ‘quotas’ and ‘turnover’ only exacerbates frequently excessive police clampdowns. Furthermore, even though there are a great many differences in the conditions for confiscating a driving licence among the Member States, and the systems for the scale of offences and fines in the field of road safety vary from one country to another, Europe wants to establish an electronic system for Member States to exchange information relating to offences committed on their territory, and in order to penalise motorists even more. While we can, of course, only welcome a reduction in the number of road accidents, it is important to ensure that these new legislative measures are not accompanied by attacks on freedoms, or unlawful, inappropriate or unfair measures.

 Ultra-Europeans seem to see immigration of job seekers and people as the miracle solution to the problems of labour shortages and falling birth rates experienced by all Member States. This foolish attitude is an admission of powerlessness: Europe, as it stands, has nothing to suggest that can meet the challenges it is facing. A new Europe, on the other hand, must promote economic and social policies of national and Community protection and preferences, a family-friendly policy to encourage people to have children, and a foreign policy involving development aid to third countries so that those countries, which are experiencing emigration on a massive scale, can stabilise their populations by significantly improving living standards. The European Training Foundation is an agency of the European Union that aims to help develop the education and training systems of the EU’s partner countries. This would be a highly laudable aim if it did not, in reality, consist in preparing these non-European countries to access the European labour market. We do not want additional immigration from third countries, not even from non-European candidate countries like Turkey, an Asiatic and Muslim country that we refuse to see joining the European Union.

 If there is one field where cooperation between the Member States of the European Union is important and needs to be supported with all our might, it is this one concerning justice and the police. The recent results achieved by the joint Franco-Belgian investigative team, which, after months of surveillance, has succeeded in arresting 16 young Jihadist fanatics and in dismantling an Islamist terrorist network based in Brussels, provide evidence of the need for collaboration between the police forces of Europe. Organised crime, corruption, drug trafficking and terrorism, as we all know, do not respect national borders. The Member States of the European Union have already been collaborating for a number of years in the context of intergovernmental cooperation. In its sinful pride, the European Union wants to jump on the bandwagon and is trying to set up, under its rule, this type of relationship within a European Judicial Network arranged around national contact points. We remain in favour of cooperation, and we support this initiative, provided that the Member States are not deprived of their legitimate sovereign competences for the sake of a new bureaucratic European body.

Although the report by Mrs Stauner refers to the Lisbon Strategy, that patent Europeanist failure, it deserves to be supported because it questions the credo of immigration as a remedy to further deterioration in the demographic, economic and social deficits of Europe. Immigration, selective or otherwise, distorts the identity and culture of the people of Europe and aggravates community divisions and the tensions that derive from them, in the image of what is happening in every multi-ethnic and multicultural society in the world. It is neo-proslavery which only benefits the money-grubbers of globalisation, who see in this cheap labour a means of exerting pressure on wages against a background of already very high unemployment. It will allow the elites of third countries to be pillaged, thereby exacerbating their situation. It is a delusion in strategic terms, because the behaviour of immigrants will end up being modelled on that of Europeans; I am thinking here mainly of the unfortunate tendency to have fewer children in a society which is truly disorientated on all counts. Apart from supporting families and a higher birth rate in Europe, the new Europe of the nations needs a policy of national and Community preference, a policy of national and Community protection.

The interventions by Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission, during the debate on the EU Blue Card and the single permit which amalgamates the residence permit and work permit were highly illustrative. Here is a short anthology. To quote Jacques Barrot, ‘These texts demonstrate the true scope of this Immigration and Asylum Pact which the French Presidency has brought to a successful conclusion and prove that this pact is, in fact, a balanced pact that expresses the will of Europeans to open the door to migratory movements which may be particularly useful and prove to be very positive for the future of our European society’. He also said, ‘The possibility of being able to return to the country of origin for two years without losing the status of long-term resident is essential’. To quote Jean-Pierre Jouyet, ‘these two texts are a beginning, not an end, and leave room for circular migration’. He also said, ‘These two texts demonstrate that the European Union is truly committed to promoting legal immigration’. There can be no doubt henceforth; our leaders and our French representatives in the European institutions support mass populating immigration from outside Europe leading to national disintegration policies. We shall be voting against.

Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Commissioner, I thank you most sincerely. Through your points of view, you have just provided me with the arguments for my next electoral campaigns, relative to this question of immigration, since you yourselves speak of – and I quote – ‘an open European Union, opening up to migratory flows, the advantages of the Blue Card opened up to as many people as possible, attracting skills, not hindering immigration’. See nothing, hear nothing, know nothing – that could be the motto of the European institutions regarding the immigration question, while the people of Europe have been suffering daily for 20 years in relation to this question, with all the social and economic consequences in terms of identity, security, job insecurity, poverty and unemployment. I hear references to the rights of immigrants, but who mentions the social rights of the workers? Who speaks of those who, in their millions and tens of millions in Europe, are in a difficult social situation, who do not access employment at any level of hierarchy or qualifications? Furthermore, the integration policy conducted in Europe is a true national disintegration policy, of which we have fallen foul through excessive Communitisation. The Blue Card that you are proposing is nothing but an indraught to the entire world to attract millions of new immigrants, whereas it is not this policy that needs to be pursued, but a policy for returning immigrants to their countries, a policy of national and Community preference, a policy of national and Community protection. Finally, by plundering the elites in the developing world, you are going to prevent the economic development of these countries. These peoples and these countries need capital and skilled workers. You are depriving them of both.

Both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the members of the political groups in plenary today have once again shown just how unimportant they consider impartiality and respect for the law to be, when compared with their obsession with getting rid of all those who are not part of their large family of Euro-federalists. My colleague, Mr Vanhecke, is the target of a veritable witch-hunt in Belgium, the sole aim of which is to condemn him and force him to step down from the political stage. The European Parliament has forgotten that, when any request is made by a state to waive parliamentary immunity, it has a duty to apply the rules on the protection of MEPs in full, as laid down in its Rules of Procedure. Like Mr Gollnisch, who had his parliamentary immunity withdrawn solely for political reasons in 2006, Mr Vanhecke is himself the victim of what constitutes a very real assault, by the transformation of a legal issue into a political issue. It is unacceptable for an institution to claim, wrongly, to be democratic.

Our Parliament is at last recognising the horror of the extermination by famine – the Holomodor – instigated in the Ukraine by the Soviet regime. It is regrettable, however, that it has not taken the Ukrainian Parliament’s lead and described this mass crime as a genocide. Indeed, the famine, which killed millions of Ukrainians between 1932 and 1933, did not result exclusively from the economic and social absurdity of communism; it was the fruit of an extermination plan fitting the definition of a genocide, that is to say: ‘the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such’, and also ‘deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’. At a time when, in France, in particular, a certain middle-class communist left extreme is benefiting from media support, recognition of a genocide such as this would make it possible to remember the horrors of Marxism-Leninism, which has been responsible for the deaths of 200 million human beings since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and which is today still oppressing over one and a half billion people, in Cuba, in North Korea, in Vietnam and, above all, in China, where the most uncontrolled form of capitalism combines very well with communist totalitarianism.

 According to the Internet Watch Foundation, an English organisation which fights the possession and dissemination of child pornography images, the online sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes is a growing sector which is low-risk and highly profitable. Indeed, the sale of these images on the Internet constitutes a vile trade worth billions of euros. We endorse the approach of the Commission and our fellow Member in wanting to put a stop to this kind of activity, in particular, by establishing a blocking mechanism for credit card or electronic payments when child pornography images are bought on the Internet. Unfortunately, there is currently a serious technical limitation to all the national and European protection mechanisms being developed. In fact, most commercial servers offering these images are not located in Europe, but in the United States, Russia and Asia. Therefore, their illegal content can easily be uploaded in one country and viewed in another. It is therefore understandable that effective means to counter the development of Internet paedophilia, while necessary, are problematical.

 The goal, set by the European Union, of a social Europe is an illusion, the Lisbon Strategy is a failure, and the various magic potions dreamt up by the pro-Europeans to improve living and working conditions are rendered ineffective by the simple fact that Brussels’ true vision is ultra-liberal and in the service of globalisation. We want, on the one hand, to prevent social dumping in order to protect workers, whether they are posted or not, and thereby have a balanced internal market, and, on the other, to do everything we can to open up our economic borders a little more through the massive immigration of job seekers and people. This is just a never-ending illustration of true pro-European schizophrenia. By way of example, we need only note the references to the defunct Treaty of Lisbon made several times in this hotchpotch report. Consequently, we do not see how it could provide a clear vision seeking a balance between the free movement of services and the rights of workers.

The Commission has just published its 24th annual report on its control of application of Community law by the Member States. The quite legitimate question that can be asked is: are there any differences or progress in relation to the previous report? It would seem not. As always, the poor students of Europe are the Member States. What solution is proposed by the rapporteur? More firmness with regard to the Member States, more submissions to the Court of Justice if necessary and more firmness in executing the decisions pronounced by the Court. In a word: more powers of coercion and repression for European institutions in relation to the Member States. The Community legal order, already set up with treaties that take precedence over national rights, now wants to be more and more oppressive and destructive of the said rights of the Member States. We are resolutely hostile to this, since the enfeoffment of national rights and legal specificities will surely lead to enfeoffment of the Member States themselves in a Europeist and federalist project.

 The objective of encouraging economic immigration on a huge scale, already set out on 11 January 2005 by the European Commission in its ‘Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration’ is more topical than ever, given this report. No fewer than EUR 950 million have been appropriated to the Erasmus Mundus II programme for the period 2009-2013. This programme is intended to attract foreign students and teachers to the geographical area of the European Union. That is some EUR 654 million more than the amount appropriated to the first version of the programme. Under the pretext – laudable in itself – of encouraging students from third countries to come to study in Europe by offering them high-level master’s degrees or doctorates, what in reality are being opened up are the floodgates for a new channel of legal immigration. Easier access to Europe will, in fact, be given to foreigners from third countries by means, in particular, of simplified procedures for obtaining visas and scholarships and modified tuition fees. Far from favouring its own nationals and encouraging the European research and excellence it needs, the European Union is again favouring those from outside the EU and exhibiting its penchant for immigration on a huge scale.

The report by our colleague signals a real step forward for the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States. There is no doubt that individuals such as Fourniret, a disgusting paedophile who managed to terrorise people in France and then in Belgium because his criminal record had not been forwarded from one country to another, may still exist. Such monsters, murderers, louts and thieves cannot hide from justice behind a lack of transparency in the various national databases. For these imperious reasons, we support the establishment of the European Criminal Records Information System insofar as it will guarantee each person’s fundamental freedoms. I am thinking in particular of the necessary protection of the freedom of expression and of the ideological penalisation of the crime of having an opinion when it does not conform to the pro-European dogmas and dictatorship of the politically correct. The electronic interconnection of criminal records will also require us to take essential precautions such as guaranteeing the integrity and authenticity of the information exchanged and ensuring that it is updated. We are today at the preliminary stage of this mechanism: we must therefore remain alert and prudent.

It is essential to combat undeclared work, particularly when this cancer of the economy is increasing, thereby curbing our growth and distorting competition on the internal market through social dumping. The first victims of this underground economy are the legal workers, the citizens of the Member States, whose legitimate economic and social rights are threatened. We could welcome this report for what it denounces. Unfortunately, it is one more opportunity for these relentless pro-Europeans to use as a social lever the option of large-scale economic immigration: emergency immigration, in their view, for the broken European economy and population. This call to replace the immigration of illegal labour with ‘legal’ immigration is unfounded hypocrisy. Moreover, it makes no economic, social or societal sense. France and Europe do not have to open up more ‘channels for legal immigration’ when they cannot even stop illegal immigration. In order to boost growth and regain control of the internal market we need to restore the citizens’ confidence through a family-oriented and pro-birth policy, through better training and guidance for young people and the unemployed, and, finally, through Community preference and protection.

Europe wants to adorn itself with the regalia of a state. It wants its own anthem, flag, day, currency and motto. We do not want this super-state; we do not want this imposed federalism. In 2005 the French and Dutch people rejected by referendum the draft European Constitution that incorporated these symbols. In June 2008 it was the Irish who, by rejecting the Lisbon Treaty, again rejected the symbols of this super-state. It is absolutely scandalous to try to reintroduce them surreptitiously through amendments to the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. The people of Europe have a say in this matter and they must be respected. They also have a duty to remember. In the light of our increasingly globalised societies and economies, we must not forget, now more than ever, who we are, where we come from and what our values and our identities are. Europe will not be built by negating the history of its peoples and its nations and going against the national realities.

On reading this rapport, one question comes to mind: is it because the ‘first generation’ Schengen Information System did not work or was at least ineffective as a means of ensuring security within the Schengen area that a ‘second generation’ system, intended to remedy these shortcomings, is being implemented? Sadly not, as this second-generation system is no more than an updated version of an already flawed system. According to the figures given by the Commission, 400 000 illegal immigrants cross the Union’s borders each year. Even supposing that biometric data will soon be available and ready to use to establish files for and send home illegal immigrants already registered as such, the European Union would be incapable of putting an end to the mass immigration that takes place along its coasts and land borders because of a lack of controls at the Member States’ internal and external borders. The Schengen Information System will only ever be a useless gadget as long as the dangerous Schengen agreements are in place.

Europe wishes to protect itself against maritime accidents and the pollution of its seas and oceans. We welcome this. The recent terrible examples of the Prestige
 and Erika
 shipwrecks are there to remind us of our duty to be careful and to monitor vessel safety, but also of our responsibilities in the event of an environmental disaster. A special reference should, moreover, be made in the proposal for a Directive to post-accident inquiries. For the first time, it has been agreed that an investigative body should be set up that is charged with deciding, with complete independence and impartiality, whether or not to open an inquiry to determine the causes and circumstances of an accident. The intentions are good; let us only hope that they are not cast aside in the face of the huge financial interests at stake.

We need to develop our relations with India, which, with a population of more than a billion and a booming economy, provides a counterweight to the Muslim world and China. However, the motion for a resolution tabled, which reflects the views of Mr Sarkozy and the Commission, runs counter to the interests of the nations of Europe. The ‘comprehensive free trade agreement’ it calls for will contribute to the destruction of our economies and social systems, which are forced to compete with countries that engage in social dumping. Furthermore, India’s demand for a seat on the United Nations Security Council is one of the proposals for UN reform, which also aim to strip France and the United Kingdom of permanent membership of the Security Council and give it instead to Brussels. Moreover, describing India as a ‘model for religious pluralism’ is an insult to the Christians massacred in Orissa. India is defending its national interests and age-old values. In order to have a balanced relationship with India, our Member States must do the same. They can only do that in a different Europe: a Europe of sovereign nations rooted in the Christian and Greco-Roman values of its civilisation.

 On Saturday 20 September a suicide bomber caused a lorry to explode in front of the Marriott Hotel in the heart of the Pakistani capital, reducing it to a burned-out ruin and killing at least 60 people. This attack was attributed to the Pakistani Taliban linked to Al-Qaeda. On Sunday 20 and Monday 21 September it was the turn of ETA, the Basque separatist organisation, to spill blood in three attacks. The preparations for these attacks are thought to have been made in France. Terrorism has no borders, and the Schengen area offers it the perfect cradle in which to recruit, indoctrinate and make the logistical preparations for attacks. In France the Interior Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie said on the subject that ‘French prisons are a hotbed of recruitment for radical Islamists.’ An honest admission! It is a fact that terrorism has many causes, but today they mainly lie in the armed combat of radical Islam. Curiously, there are no legislative texts aimed at detecting and preventing recruitment in prisons or in certain so-called ‘sensitive’ neighbourhoods. The European Union intends to give itself a body of legislation to combat terrorism. (Explanation of vote cut pursuant to Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)

 There are sometimes fortunate, perhaps even amusing, coincidences. Indeed, we are taking the opportunity given to us by this annual report on equality between men and women, coming at the same time as the French Presidency of the European Union, to highlight a marginal but entertaining point which is at worst a lack of tact and at best a perfect application of the principle of equality between women and men, which means not discriminating between them. A few days ago, on the occasion of the start of Mr Sarkozy’s Presidency, which received such a lot of media attention, MEPs were given gifts. In the free document wallet, notably there was a tie. Of the 785 MEPs, nearly a third are women. Were they not entitled to a small personalised gift too, or are we supposed to conclude from this that women also have to wear ties? It still seems to be the case that, when big debates are taking place on the role and position of women in political life, boorish behaviour very often still gets the better of courteousness.

This process is the result of the ill-prepared enlargements to the East, which bring us closer to the conflict zones of the Balkans and the Caucasus. What then will the consequences of Turkey’s membership be, which borders Iraq and Iran? Furthermore, by recognising the independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, our governments have opened a Pandora’s box, challenging the territorial integrity not only of Georgia, but of most of the European countries, both East and West. If, as the Socialists, Liberals, PPE and Verts would like, Georgia became a member of NATO and joined a European Union governed by the Treaty of Lisbon, our nations would enter into conflict with Russia. The Europe of Brussels signifies war. More than ever, faced with a more powerful China and the Islamist threat, it is time to build another Europe, the Europe of sovereign states, united with Russia through the bonds of civilisation constituted by our Greek and Christian heritage.

 Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it is normal in this House for us to rabbit on about social policy. Unfortunately the European social model is now no more than a myth, because the social reality in our country of France, and my own region in particular, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, is that we have a state of social decline, despair, social precarity and working conditions, mass unemployment and – something else that is altogether alarming and huge – a falling birth rate. Our thinking is still based on the social model of the 1960s, that is to say a model that assumes full employment and a large workforce. But for the last thirty years we have had mass unemployment and a sharply declining birth rate, which has taken us from baby boom to old folks boom and plunged the funding of our pensions into crisis. We must stop thinking that we have to defend the European social model at all costs and get ready instead to reorganise it. Our economic and historical analysis suggests that this should be done in two ways: first, we need a family policy that will bring the birth rate back up, otherwise we shall not be able to fund our pension schemes in the decades ahead and, secondly, we need a policy to re-energise the single market and get people back to work. In order to re-energise the EU single market we must reindustrialise and, unfortunately, if we persist with our almost religious faith in free trade and uncontrolled liberalism, we shall be unable to do what we must do to make our businesses competitive on our own home market. For these reasons our future efforts and our goal of improving social conditions must be rooted in this idea of national and Community preference and national and Community protection.

 It is with some irony that we note that, for the first time, a European Parliament report describes the massive influx of immigrants into an EU Member State as a ‘burden’. Should immigration not be more of an opportunity that is beneficial to all the peoples of Europe? Let there be no doubt about this: the absurdity of the obligation to take in asylum seekers and strict compliance with the principle of non-refoulement
 are not being called into question. The report highlights only the deficiencies of the Dublin system with regard to the determination of which Member State is responsible for processing asylum applications. This is self-evident given the ever-increasing migration flows to countries that, for the most part, are located on the southern periphery of the EU. Once again, the report offers a fallacious solution to the technical and human problems associated with migration waves. The establishment of a common asylum system, which is bound to be ineffective in a constantly enlarging EU with porous borders, is not what is needed. Quite the reverse, Member States should be given the right to take their own decisions on migration and the management of their borders.

 Although it would like to be able to boast the opposite, Europe has made no progress in the area of freedom, security and justice. Quite the contrary, since the deplorable Schengen Agreement was first implemented, the lifting of internal border controls has led to an explosion in organised crime and all forms of trafficking. The European Union, a real sorcerer’s apprentice in terms of security, with methods that all too often pose a threat to the security of states and their peoples, has imposed on us this area of insecurity lacking in freedoms and justice. The Schengen Borders Code will not help because it is the very foundations of the Schengen Agreement that are inadequate and unacceptable. Common security will prevail only if each state regains full sovereignty in the management of its borders and its migration policy. The pinnacle of the absurd is reached when this involves transferring even more responsibilities to a Union that is already paralysed.

 Just for once, Brussels wants to take back through the window what the French, Dutch and Irish threw out the door in the 2005 and June 2008 referendums: the establishment of a single European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The temptation proves too great for our pro-European sorcerer’s apprentices. Whatever it takes, any objections, rejections and legitimate resistance by the peoples of Europe must be overcome and ignored in order to communitise by force all justice, security and immigration issues. Europe is sorely mistaken. The requisite cooperation between Member States in judicial, police and even criminal matters must not result in their subjection to a supranational legal order that has been established in spite of all the differences existing between the legal systems and traditions of the Member States.

There has been a lot of noise from the left and far left aimed at stigmatising the Weber report, Parliament’s interpretation of the Returns Directive, which does not quite measure up to what is needed as far as immigration policy is concerned. We hardly dare state the obvious that to cross a frontier illegally without a visa or residence permit is an illicit act and should be treated as such. In deliberately losing their papers or refusing to say where they come from, so as not to be returned to their country of origin, illegal immigrants and they alone are responsible for the period they spend in detention, which some believe, wrongly, is too long. To talk about human rights only masks the reality of the situation: Europe is being swamped by illegal immigration, which in essence cannot be controlled, and this is coming on top of the legal migration that is being encouraged by national and European authorities alike. The Weber report, while inadequate for the purpose, is a step in the right direction. I hope that this is merely the first stage. Are national governments and the European Parliament at last waking up to the scale of the problem? It is already quite late in the day ...

 The European Commission is proposing to make 2010 the ‘European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion’
. With the largest ever budget for a European year, the political connotations of the project are all too clear. This year of ‘combat’ will serve merely to boost the image of a European Union which is witnessing the complete failure of its Lisbon Strategy. Although the fight against poverty and social exclusion is a priority and must be supported, despite all of these pious hopes, Europe will have done nothing to improve the lives of the 78 million Europeans living below the poverty threshold. This is why I will be voting against this report, the sole acknowledged political aim of which is to pander to the propaganda of the euro-globalists. Following the Irish ‘no’ vote, it is time for the arrogance of the ultra-Europeans to be replaced by an objective review of current European integration.

The very title of the resolution underlines Mr Sarkozy’s failure. Not content with being the President of the French Republic, he was trying to become the designer, then the president, of a Euro-Mediterranean Union, open only to the countries bordering the Mediterranean. Even before his European presidency begins, his house of cards is collapsing. Germany has imposed its positions: all the EU Member States will participate in this project, designed to be a simple expansion of the Barcelona Process, managed by the Eurocrats in Brussels. This fiasco illustrates the debasement of our country in the European institutions. The Europe of Brussels, far from strengthening France, as the UMP and PS claim, is making it weaker in all sectors: in the economic sector, with the destruction of our small farms, the collapse and relocation of our industries; in the military sector, with the dismantlement of our army, now required to dissolve into a Euro corps; in the demographic sector, with immigration that is threatening our national identity. Only a new Europe, a Europe of nation states, founded on the sovereignty of the nations and on the founding values of our European and Christian civilisation, will enable France to become a major player once again and implement in the Mediterranean a major cooperation policy aimed, inter alia
, at ensuring that the immigrant populations return to their home countries.

This means our Parliament runs the risk of being dominated, not by the PPE-DE Group or by the Socialist Group, but by AKP Islamists. Turkey will also be the country receiving most assistance: Turkish regions will absorb the vast majority of structural funds, and its ten million farmers will destroy the common agricultural policy. This refusal to accept reality also leads our governments to ignore the wishes of the peoples of Europe. Thus, having imposed the European constitutional treaty on France which the country rejected in 2005, Mr Sarkozy is making ready to remove Article 88.5 of the Constitution, submitting the accession of new EU states to a referendum. If Brussels succeeded in imposing Turkey’s accession, we would have to suggest our nations quit such a setup, which would be European only in name, in order to build another Europe, a European Europe: the Europe of nations.

 The employment situation in the European Union is not very good. The average unemployment rate of 7.3% in 2007, not taking account of assisted jobs, is higher than that of the other major economic blocs. In North America it is less than 5%. Far from improving the situation, the guidelines that have been presented to us will make it worse. The Lisbon Strategy, viewed in a positive light by the rapporteur, opens our economies up to unfair competition, particularly from communist China, which practises true social dumping. Furthermore, by demanding the reduction of ‘employment gaps between third country nationals and EU citizens’, the report clearly forms part of the immigrationist policy pursued for decades in our countries which, by bringing more than 1.5 million immigrants in from outside Europe, is in the process of turning us into third world nations. Restoring national preference, which is fair positive discrimination, reducing the weight of immigration and thereby reducing the tax burden on our companies and employees, and implementing the principle of Community preference to protect the European market: these are the principal measures that should be taken to develop employment in Europe.

Although it is true that, in combating drug use, information, prevention and awareness are essential to avert the risks of drug addiction for the physical and mental health of users, they are unfortunately not enough. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, over 70 million Europeans have smoked cannabis and 60% of people that go to discos in France, Italy and the United Kingdom have taken cocaine. It has to be concluded that European information and communication strategies are totally ineffective, since drug supply and demand is unfortunately on the increase everywhere in France and in Europe. No compromise is acceptable where the use and sale of drugs is concerned. Only zero tolerance works. The harm caused to thousands of victims by experimental policies to liberalise drugs confirms that evidence.

 Cooperation between Member States and the exchange of information are certainly necessary when it comes to immigration policies. This is particularly important since the Schengen Agreement doing away with all controls at the Union’s internal borders means that the decisions taken in one Member State, especially those concerning the regularisation of illegal immigrants, have consequences for, and in, neighbouring countries. If there is one area in which Europe excels, it is in the creation of agencies, bodies and all kinds of structures, provided with staff and a budget, which justify the Union’s action and give the appearance of wanting to resolve the problems. That is not the case at all, however. This is particularly true when it comes migration, for which the plethora of existing structures, be they governmental, non-governmental or intergovernmental, sit side by side without any conclusive results. Research centres, professional bodies, the European migration observatory, Eurostat, Europol, the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi), and so on: the list is never-ending. This report seeks to add an umpteenth: a European Migration Network, the supposed first stage before the creation of a new European observatory or agency. It is time to curb this Europe of excess and pretence.

Europeans are a disappearing species. With an average birth rate of less than 1.5, by the year 2050 EU-27 will have lost some 20 million people and those over 65 years old will account for 30% of the population. The measures proposed by Mrs Castex to rectify the European birth rate are laughable because, like all Europeanists in power, our fellow Member does not want to renew the European population, but to replace it with immigrants from Africa and Asia. That is why she uses 15 articles in her report to call for facilities to reunite families, civil rights for immigrants, and increased efforts to integrate them ... This policy, advocated in France by Mr Attali and implemented by Mr Sarkozy, will bring a further 80 million immigrants to Europe by the year 2050, and will eventually lead to the disappearance of our peoples. To guarantee the survival of the European peoples, migratory flows must actually be reversed and a large-scale birth promotions policy implemented based on the family and the embracing of life. This means that our nations must seek their sovereignty and identity within a new Europe, the Europe of nations.

This report on eradicating terrorism takes its place in an endless series of texts glorifying human rights and the battle against discrimination. Yet the fact is that over-cautiousness about possible infringements of fundamental freedoms – particularly freedom of expression and freedom of religion – actually erodes the resources we need in order to fight terrorism. It must be obvious by now that the European Parliament is more concerned with protecting rights of every hue, and with doing what is politically correct, than it is with the security of European Union citizens. So it is that this report, about factors favouring support for terrorism, contains not a single reference to mosques although, as we know, they are nothing less than recruiting centres for future Islamic terrorists. Nor is there any reference to the imams of France, Belgium, the Netherlands or Denmark, who are effectively recruiting agents for Jihad-minded Islamic youth. Let us not shock anyone; let us not ruffle any religious sensibilities; let us be non-discriminatory: it hardly amounts to an effective recipe for tackling the ever-growing threat of Islamic terrorism! What it does amount to is actually quite the reverse.

 The text before us is attempting to give a legal framework to operations carried out by special intervention units of one Member State sent to the territory of another, in the event of a terrorist attack. Because these interventions can be so diverse (exchange of equipment, expertise, active units, etc.), it is left up to the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements to define the practical arrangements and to decide whether to accept or refuse the request for intervention on their territory of one of these operational units. Unbelievable. Finally, here is a real case of the application of that controversial and complicated principle of subsidiarity! Finally, here is an area – that of national security, the sovereign area par excellence
 – that is resisting the supranational bulldozer of a Europe that legislates on everything, everywhere. For effectiveness in the fight against terrorism, then, Europe is putting its money on cooperation between national police forces. We support this initiative. But the key to victory over terrorism does not lie solely in cooperation. It requires an awareness of the revolutionary desire of Islamists, who advocate the destruction of humanist and Christian Western society and its values.

The aims of the Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2007-2012 – while undoubtedly laudable in themselves – are unlikely to be realised, just as the Lisbon strategy is unlikely to be realised by 2010. Moreover, such is the degree of disparity in legislation on these matters in Europe that they are not readily manageable at Community level, and the big risk is that health and safety standards will converge towards the lowest common denominator. Instead of publicising the benefits and advantages it has to offer, Europe should be taking practical action and attacking the factors that actually place working people at risk, namely insecurity, unemployment and poverty. When these have been addressed, and only then, questions of health and safety at work can, of course, be resolved in the ongoing process of common standard-setting. Our leaders in Europe are mistaken: encouraging immigration is not the way to reduce levels of poverty or its prevalence, or to promote growth. That much is plain from the fact that the last 10 years, with immigration at unprecedented levels, have seen lower than ever growth rates by comparison with the rest of the world. The Community strategy for health and safety at work has not taken these parameters into account. We shall therefore vote against the report.

 It is astounding to see how hemiplegic the European Parliament can be: it can only look right! The various resolutions proposed by the PSE, Liberals, Verts or even Communists only consider extremism on the part of the ‘extreme right’. What about radical Islamism and all those Trotskyites and communists? Not once are these types of extremism mentioned. This is an insult for all the victims of totalitarian communist regimes and for all those who suffer on a daily basis because of the dogma and practices of radical Islamism. The European Parliament does not believe these types of extremism are objectionable. They just do not exist, because they do not form part of the current standard vocabulary of political correctness within these walls. Out of respect for the principles and values of democracy, equality and tolerance, the PSE Group is quick to welcome the dissolution of the extreme right-wing political group Independence, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) before calling for the conditions governing the formation of political groups within Parliament to be strengthened. The leitmotiv of these elected members is to systematically demonise their political opponents in order to impose their conservatism on everyone. These resolutions are a hypocritical, blind and obscurantist chore. We will be voting against them.

 The textile sector in France and in Europe since the end of the Multi Fibre Arrangement has turned some of our regions into economic and social deserts. Poverty and deprivation reign there for the thousands of men and women who have lost their jobs. The destruction of these companies, of this social fabric, in the name of globalisation and pro-European ultraliberalism, is the symbol of one of the greatest economic failures of the European Union. For years, this approach has led to our manufacturing in all economic sectors, even where it was of a very high standard, being relocated to other countries throughout the world: to North Africa and especially to Asia. This global rebalancing will not actually have given these third countries anything, except to worsen economic slavery for the benefit of a small elite in Chinese factories and to establish long-term unemployment in Europe against a background of persistent economic crisis. Clearly, global competition, as encouraged by the WTO, is the main reason for the widespread impoverishment and lack of dynamism of Europe. The European Union urgently needs to put an end to this madness, and finally to set up Community protection and preference.

 The purpose of Mrs Roure’s report is to combat racism. This is a very laudable goal, but it is unfortunately being used as an excuse to apply a policy which discriminates against nationals of our Member States, who are becoming second-class citizens in their own countries. Two tragic events last Sunday illustrate this. The murder of a young French woman, Anne-Lorraine Schmitt, by a convicted rapist of Turkish origin, did not hit the headlines, unlike the deaths on the same day of two ‘youths’, Moushin and Larami, who were speeding on an unlicensed mini-bike without crash-helmets and collided with a police car. The accident was widely covered on the television news, and the French President met the parents of the two teenagers. So, if you want the State’s sympathy, do you have to burn and ransack a town, as hundreds of thugs did, claiming to be avenging the death of their ‘mates’ Moushin and Larami? Why are innocent victims entitled to less consideration than delinquents? It is high time to put an end to these aberrations: the authorities’ soft approach, the insane immigration policy of the last 30 years, and the supposed anti-racism which in France is more like out-and-out anti-French racism.

 The proliferation of new words is one of the symptoms of an incurable problem: a lack of talent or expertise despite the wealth of existing vocabulary. It is also a slide towards the uniform language used by an elite which has no homeland, no faith and no laws, and its propaganda machines. ‘Flexicurity’, which is supposed to be a method of achieving prosperity throughout Europe through a balanced combination of ‘flexibility’ in the economic field and ‘security’ in the social field, is a new Europeanist pro-globalisation gimmick. For the European Commission this basically just involves relaxing labour law in order to combat unemployment. In reality, however, the main effect of this liberal concept will be to make it easier and cheaper for businesses to lay workers off in order to recruit cheaper labour. This will draw in yet more migrants from outside Europe, but it will also present a social threat by having a domino effect, making low-paid jobs a little less secure and going on to affect the higher-paid too. Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs tried to amend this text to mitigate the impact on employment, but this will not be enough to curb the ultra-liberal appetite of the Europeanists.

 This report on social reality stocktaking in Europe sets out its true economic and social condition from the start. It is an admission of powerlessness within an ocean of Europeanist absurdities churned out by the ultraliberal, globalist thought police. Since 2000, none of the measures to combat unemployment, poverty and exclusion have achieved anything. Worse still, while the European Union calls for greater economic immigration and the protection of its so-called social model, the report reminds us that 78 million Europeans are living in poverty. It forgets to mention what accompanies the hell of poverty, which is not just economic. It is psychological for millions of Europeans who feel culturally and socially adrift on their own soil as they watch their work disappearing abroad in relocations. It is also physical, when violence and insecurity largely generated by immigrant populations frustrated by the difficulties they have in integrating aggravate the whole situation. The solution is therefore not to recognise the hybrid ultraliberal schizophrenic European system, but to challenge it in order to put forward a Europe of recovered identities, which applies protection and Community preference to Europeans first of all!

This report deals with the certification at Community level of lifelong learning qualifications. This is a completely desirable measure and one that should be encouraged. However, I reject the internationalist justification used in the document, especially as I recall the total defeat suffered by the Lisbon Strategy. There is an element of Europeanist ideology in this text. It is written that the sacrosanct objective of globalisation constitutes our one and only hope of salvation and that globalisation is beneficial both economically and socially. In my opinion ultra-liberal globalisation is a machine for destroying the economic, social and cultural fabric of nations. Moreover, the report only refers to potential progress, something for the future. Should we not be looking at the present as we attempt to analyse the failures and damage that has already been done to our society by globalisation? In the face of such blindness, irresponsibility and inadequacy I intend to vote against the report.

 Mr President, the European authorities, and in particular the Kacin report, generally seem to treat Serbia not as a sovereign state but as a naughty schoolboy, a ne’er-do-well, someone the European Union has the right to give good marks and bad marks to. Serbia gets good marks when it acquires a government that is described as being pro-European. This pro-European reference of course means being liable for and subject to the dogma that pertains in Brussels. It gets bad marks when the Serbs prove less than enthusiastic about collaborating with the International Criminal Tribunal. Here it is useful to recall that this Tribunal has scorned two principles that in fact go to the heart of our justice system: the legal sovereignty of states and freedom of expression. As a result, Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party that represents 28% of the electorate, has been imprisoned in The Hague since February 2003 and is still awaiting a verdict, even though he turned himself in voluntarily. This Tribunal is therefore blatantly violating the very principles that have been declared by the European Union, namely respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights. To tell the truth, Mr Seselj’s only crime is to be a Serbian patriot. The rulers of the European Union, who wish to break up the nations of Europe, cannot in fact forgive the Serbs for having resisted the destruction of their state, and in particular the secession of Kosovo, the historic heart of Serbia. The treatment inflicted on the Serbs in Kosovo is a warning to all the peoples of Europe. If today the Albanians are calling for the establishment of a Kosovar state, it is because immigration from Albania and the falling birth-rate among Serbs have given them a majority in a province where, some fifty years ago, they were in the minority. The Kosovan example should compel us more than ever to reaffirm the right of the peoples of Europe to be themselves and to make their own decisions, in other words to preserve their identity and sovereignty, and in an enlarged European Europe of nations and homelands there should also clearly be a legitimate place for the people of Serbia.

How can a report be submitted to the representatives of Member States using legal and institutional notions that are simultaneously hazy, new, dangerous and utopian? Degressive proportionality, the main feature of the report, means nothing beyond the fact that larger states will again lose seats to smaller states. It is true that at the European Council meeting in Nice Mr Chirac originally initiated the process by agreeing for the first time to uncouple France with respect to Germany, contrary to the spirit of the Treaties. As for electing Members from transnational lists, it is obvious what the aim is here: to get rid of politically incorrect parties that do not accept the languid social-democrat consensus, and to remove any reference to anything that is still the regal domain of the nation states. We obviously cannot accept this. The notion of European citizen put forward by the rapporteurs is both dangerous and utopian, and in fact it is totalitarian. It implies that nationality is a thing of the past and that the brave new world consists of a new ‘denationalised’ man, bereft of his roots, his history and his culture. For all these reasons, we feel that the Lamassoure report is an unacceptable legal, political and institutional regression.

If the people of Europe do not vote in large numbers in their country of residence and if the level of participation in the European elections fails to match the aspirations of the Eurocrats it will not be because the application of voting rights and eligibility for the European elections has been overcomplicated by the need to exchange information between the Member States. It will simply be because your bureaucracy and policies appear to them at best pointless and incomprehensible and at worst harmful, and because many European citizens not residing in their country of origin prefer to participate in the parliamentary elections being held in their own country. As for the report, it uses this technical pseudo-simplification in an attempt to authorise multiple candidacies, in other words the appearance of the same candidate in several countries, something that would give an inordinate advantage under common law to foreign residents only, and it tries to bypass the laws of the Members States where ineligibility is concerned. This is absolutely unacceptable. We believe that citizenship is indissolubly linked to nationality and the rights, particularly electoral, that it generates can only be exercised within a national setting. If European citizens want to participate in the democratic life of their host country then the option is always there: naturalisation.

Parliament’s resolution only contains a few proposals for putting an end to the import of dangerous products, half of which come from China. It focuses on toys, yet fails to mention clothing containing toxic dyes, dangerous medicines, foodstuffs containing ingredients unfit for human consumption, electrical goods that catch fire, toothpaste made from antifreeze: the list just goes on. It also makes do with feeble measures that are based on cooperation and certification and points the finger of responsibility at the Member States rather than at China, at European companies rather than at others. This is just not enough in this particular instance. It is time to apply exemplary sanctions against any country that, after becoming a member of the WTO, continues to engage in dubious commercial practices, whether this be dumping, counterfeiting or forced labour. It is true that the few trade protection instruments available to the European Union fall within the competence of Mr Mandelson, who has quite rightly been cited for his passivity in this area. If at the end of the day we are then to approve this document it is because, in spite of everything, it is better to have some derisory measures in place than none at all. At least that is some form of reaction.

 In considering that ‘the future situations of the European Union labour markets can be broadly described as in demand of [...] legal immigration’, Mrs Gruber, like Mr Sarkozy in France, is seeking to give economic justification to the immigration policies being applied in our various Member States. However, the labour force coming from those countries that have been slow to develop is for the most part ill-equipped for the jobs that our economies need doing. Moreover, it has to be remembered that legal immigration is essentially the immigration not of workers but of people. This policy that is bringing us nearly two million additional immigrants every year is in fact turning into a colonisation of Europe. Between now and 2050 the non-European population, which already stands at some 40 million people, will have tripled. With the accession of Turkey the Europe being constructed by Brussels will include 220 million Asians and Africans, most of whom will be from the Muslim world. This colonisation of population constitutes a lethal threat to the Christian and humanist values of our civilisation. If we are to protect the legitimate rights of the peoples of Europe to self-determination and to remain themselves, we have to restore our borders, reverse the flow of migrants and introduce major policies that are pro-family and pro-life. We need a new Europe, a ‘European’ Europe, a Europe of sovereign nations, for that is the only thing that can guarantee our rights to defend our culture and history.

The official figures are evidence of it: Europe is being inundated with illegal immigrants. It has proved to be completely incapable of controlling its external borders. The annual report presenting the activities of Eurodac in 2006, which is the biometric tool that Europe uses for monitoring asylum applications, shows that the number of persons recorded as having illegally crossed one of Europe’s external borders is up 64% on 2005. The report presented by Mr Moreno puts forward a number of approaches that are supposed to put an end to this phenomenon, which is growing exponentially. I think they are all as useless as each other, not to say counterproductive. For example, how can we be happy with the idea that to encourage legal immigration, and to do so mainly by means of the European Blue Card, which would essentially be a European work permit for immigrants, will reduce the level of illegal immigration? That is idiotic. If you open the doors to some, you are opening them to everyone. What is the point of setting up a biometric database to combat illegal immigration? Why plan to allocate more manpower and resources to the European border control agency, Frontex, when the borders in question, whether internal or external, are still not being properly protected by the Member States? Once again the European authorities have succeeded in identifying a problem but have proved incapable of resolving it, carried along as they are by an ideology based on ‘immigrationism’ and internationalism.

At the end of August, Greece experienced its worst natural disaster ever. The first partial toll of the huge fires that swept through large areas of the Peloponnese was 63 dead, over 40 000 head of cattle burnt to death, 250 000 olive trees burnt and hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest gone up in smoke. The three days of national mourning announced by the Prime Minister, Kostas Karamanlis, cannot cover up for the total failure of the State to protect its citizens and come to the aid of villagers surrounded by flames, in a country where scorching summers and fire risks are a common occurrence. Everywhere there was evidence not just of undermanning and equipment shortages, but also of the failure to plan ahead and to coordinate operations. Like the previous PASOK governments, the New Democracy government did nothing to prevent the scale and horror of the fires. With a total lack of scruple and for purely political reasons, the Prime Minister announced, even as the fires were breaking out all over Greece, that the general elections would take place as planned. In support of the Greeks who have suffered as victims of their politicians, let us hope that in future irresponsible governments will be replaced by responsible governments.

Having failed to construct an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’, the real haven of peace that Europe should have become after the ratification of the Schengen agreements, Brussels is worrying about its ‘external dimension’. Europe wants to export its democratic values and its principles of the rule of law based on respect for human rights and the existence of sound institutions. All of this is highly commendable. But what are the real methods that it is proposing? Eternal propaganda in favour of the developing world, immigration and Europe. The report therefore asks us to activate the passerelle
 clause in Article 42 of the Treaty, which would bring the provisions concerning judicial and police cooperation and illegal immigration within the Community framework. The Member States would then be bound by decisions adopted by a majority of other States, even if they did not accept them. The creation of a European ministry for foreign affairs, a proposal that was put forward in the Constitutional Treaty, which was itself rejected by French and Dutch referendums, is once again on the agenda. So once again we are talking about taking a little more of the Member States’ sovereign powers away and giving them to Brussels. What this report proposes is not more democracy but even more subservience.

On the subject of the fight against terrorism, it is most unusual that it should still be so difficult, today, for the national police forces and the anti-terrorism authorities of the various EU Member States to cooperate together and to exchange information. However, what we now know for certain is that the attacks of 11 September and those of 11 March in Madrid were planned, at least in part, on EU soil. These attacks demonstrated the ineffectiveness of Europe's instruments and policies for combating terrorism. Terrorism knows no bounds; the fight against terrorism must know no bounds either, and intergovernmental cooperation in this area must be stepped up as a matter of urgency. The same goes for the controls at the Member States’ borders: they must be reintroduced as quickly as possible, because they are the bare minimum when it comes to combating terrorism effectively and efficiently. As a final point, I should like to emphasise a reality: that of the Islamic nature of terrorism in its new guise. A new political and religious ideology is gaining ground in Europe and in the Muslim world. It represents a fearsome breeding ground for terrorism.

This report shows the will to bypass the content of the Services Directive, which legitimately excluded health services from its scope. Health services are not commercial services but services vital to our ageing populations. Health must escape the desires of the ultraliberal vultures and the European federalist ideology that is going to harmonise everything downwards. The matter of excluding health services is the responsibility of the Member States and must remain so. Next, it is worrying to note that this woolly Lisbon Strategy is still being referred to as a prerequisite when we have known for a long time that it is a symbol of ultra-European inefficiency. Furthermore, in view of the differences between our countries, one might say that the universality of a so-called European social model is utopian. Finally creating a legal framework in this area amounts to implementing a quasi-internal market in health services or at least to laying the foundations for one. Our duty is to prevent the quality of health services from being jeopardised, to preserve medical ethics and to guarantee strict controls in relation to the authorising and reimbursement of treatment at national and ministerial level.

 Madam President, what Mr Andria says in his report is quite right. Housing is a major economic and social problem. In France, more than 5.5 million people are poorly housed. What is more, rents and mortgage repayments put a big strain on the budgets of French families. However, the solution clearly does not lie with the European Structural Funds. For one thing, they would involve spreading taxpayers’ money pathetically thinly. For another, French regions such as Nord-Pas-de-Calais would scarcely benefit at all from such aid, despite being hit by unemployment, social precarity and a fall in purchasing power. The fact is that, for seven years now, the districts of French Hainault have already no longer been receiving the sums paid under Objective 1, and the Brussels EU keeps on reducing the funds earmarked for our regions. If all French people are to have decent places in which to live, a housing policy based on two principles needs to be implemented in France. The first principle is that of liberty, to which home ownership is key. At present, only 57% of households are home owners. In order to increase this figure, house purchase savings plans and accounts need to be given a boost, zero-rate loans granted to families and land tax reduced. The second principle is that whereby countries discriminate in favour of their own nationals and that, in France, would enable priority to be given to French people when it came to allocating local authority housing, including emergency housing. Moreover, it is obvious that policies aimed at social recovery and at stimulating our economy require an end to immigration from outside Europe, the exponential growth in which ruins any effective policy on housing or policy designed to combat unemployment. There is another essential precondition. The Brussels EU must stop exposing our industries to unfair international competition involving large-scale social dumping. The fact is, there is no time to be lost in constructing another Europe – a Europe of the nations, based on voluntary cooperation between Member States and on Community preference, with due respect shown for the sovereignty and identity of nations.

The regulation submitted to us establishes a mechanism that is designed to provide a Member State that is faced with a massive influx of illegal immigrants with assistance, in the form of Rapid Border Intervention Teams, for a limited period of time. This reserve, which consists of 250 to 500 border guards within the European Borders Agency (Frontex), will be made available to those Member States that need it in order to protect their external borders. It is true that, although the control of the external borders is incumbent on the Member States and comes under the intergovernmental remit, the massive influx of illegal immigrants that occurred, for example, between 15 August and 15 December 2006, when immigrants left the coasts of West Africa for the Canary Islands, showed just how wide open the Union’s external borders were to a rapidly increasing number of immigrants. Cooperation among Member States would therefore seem vital in this area. More than 31 000 illegal immigrants landed in the Canary Islands in 2006, that is to say, six times as many as in the previous year. Although we are in favour of the principle of the Member States’ cooperating in order to protect the EU’s external borders, we shall remain very vigilant regarding the trivialisation of Frontex for what are, essentially, media-motivated reasons, and to any federalist and supranational abuses of this agency.

Despite its claim to be exhaustive, the report on human rights in 2006 does not mention any of the main causes of the violation of these rights: Communism, which still oppresses more than one and a half billion people, in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and I could go on. In every country in which they are in power, Communists deny people’s fundamental rights, persecute their opponents, and send them in their millions to concentration camps. On our continent, Communism has enslaved 300 million Europeans. Today, despite the fall of the Berlin Wall, it continues to exercise its intellectual terrorism. The fact that Mr Coveney does not dare mention the word in his report proves this. Some of our fellow Members, such as Mr Cohn-Bendit, go as far as to want to ban the people of Poland from de-Communising their country. That is an insult to the memory of the workers of Gdansk, of the insurgents of Berlin in 1953, of Budapest in 1956, of Prague in 1968 and of all the freedom fighters. Since 1917, Communism has killed more than 100 million people. Our Parliament, which has so much to say on the subject of human rights, should demand that Communism be put on trial.

The European Parliament has a very particular and partisan conception of the definition of fundamental rights. These rights serve as a support in fighting against individuals whom Parliament sees as undesirable, against political opponents, or else in attacking embarrassing governments that are not politically correct. Curiously, they are never invoked in the defence, for example, of the rights of political minorities within its Chamber. Minorities, whose error is not to belong to the great right-thinking mass of Eurofederalists. In this area, the great principles of freedom of expression and equality are utterly despised. The European Parliament puts that famous expression ‘do as I say, not as I do’ into practice. This breed of European politicians is prepared to do anything to impose its vision of Europe and to do so against the wishes of the people, if necessary. Therefore, even though the European Constitution was rejected by referendum in France and the Netherlands, this breed of politician is still doing its utmost to try to get it through bit by bit. Likewise, although the Charter of Fundamental Rights has no binding legal status, the text proposed to us here seeks to make it indispensable – worse, an essential reference text – for European courts. Far from being innocent, this report is dangerous for the freedoms and rights of the people.

Mr Hasse Ferreira is right when he states that social services of general interest are a key component of the European social model, based as it is on the protection of the most vulnerable members of society: children, the elderly, the sick, disabled people, the unemployed and so on. Three developments are today undermining this social model. Firstly, the uncontrolled immigration that is in the process of ruining our social security systems. Thus, in France, the granting of free State medical aid to illegal immigrants costs EUR 600 million per year. Secondly, the destruction of borders which, by leaving our businesses to the mercy of international competition and social dumping, especially in China, is destroying the economic substructure of this social model. Thirdly, the gradual abolition of public services, as decided in 2000 during the Lisbon European Summit. The report by our fellow Member, Mr Hasse Ferreira, does not propose any solutions because these developments are the result of the ultra-liberal ideology implemented by the Europe of Brussels. Only another Europe, the Europe of nations, based on respect for national sovereignties, Community preference and borders protecting it from uncontrolled immigration and unfair international competition, will enable our nations to re-build a European social model.

Corporate social responsibility is a mish-mash of a concept that, notwithstanding the imagination of the ultra-Europeans, has nothing original to it. This non-binding gimmick appeared in the United States as far back as the 1950s. In France, the notion of ‘socially responsible companies’ came about specifically at the time of the Sudreau report in 1975. And, in 1982, social objectives were imposed on businesses in the public competition sector in an attempt to shock the people and the executives of triumphant socialism. Twenty-five years later, CSR is aimed quite simply at humanising and regulating globalisation. These pious hopes in times of unemployment and social precarity against a backdrop of international instability make CSR seem like a huge con. We must clearly stop wasting our time and our money on considerations that are aimed merely at sending out polite weedy messages when we are lagging behind the world. Let us be responsible, first and foremost, for ourselves. Let us show respect for ourselves by implementing a Europe-wide system of preference and of Community protection for people, production and businesses. Let us increase, for instance, customs duties on imports of third-country goods that have not been manufactured in accordance with minimum European social standards.

 This resolution adopts the Commission’s proposal concerning the Council’s decision, which heaps praise on the Lisbon Strategy and asserts that unemployment has gone down in Europe. The Lisbon Strategy, even in its revamped form, will remain a symbol of shallow populism and inefficiency, given that the Member States subject to the Brussels guidelines are having difficulty in toeing the pro-European line and fail on growth, employment and modernising their social security systems. This reduction in unemployment, according to the Commission’s positive assessment, is a delusion masking the reality of the figures. This is very much a case of a ‘Potemkin Village’, because, in France alone, many poor people and people in insecure employment, not to mention the unemployed on training courses and many members of the active workforce who have been given early retirement, have been skilfully excluded from the statistics. Lastly, the procedural amendment proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, wisely calling for Parliament to be given the necessary time to fulfil its consultative role on these social issues, demonstrates our institution’s powerlessness in the face of pro-European absolutism.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in setting its economic objectives, the German Presidency of the European Council is relying on a report claiming that unemployment has fallen in Europe. However, this reduction is in fact the consequence of a fall in the number of people of working age due to the aging of the population, rather than the result of a prosperous economy. With an annual growth rate of just 2.6%, compared with 3.6% in the United States and 10% in China, the Europe of Brussels is still lagging behind the world's great economic powers. On top of that, some Member States falsify the official employment statistics. In France, for example, if we add to the 2 million or more official unemployed people those people who have been forced into retirement or early retirement, the unemployed people in training, and those on subsidised contracts, unemployment actually affects almost 4.5 million people in France, or 18% of the working-age population. With growth at half mast, a population growing at below replacement rate, and businesses relocating their activities, the European Union is, unfortunately, continuing to decline economically. If, then, the diagnosis is incorrect, the treatments prescribed, inspired by the Malthusian and antisocial policy of the last 20 years, are harmful: our trade borders have been destroyed, opening up our industry to unfair competition from the Asiatic economies, bureaucratic restrictions have multiplied, more than a million immigrants arrive quite legally from outside the Community every year, our public services have been dismantled, we are overtaxed, and our agriculture, subjected to the Caudine forks of the World Trade Organisation, has been laid fallow. In order to restore our economies to prosperity and to give our descendents the economic and social security to which they are entitled, we need to construct a different Europe and a different trade model, based on secure borders to protect our businesses from social dumping, on implementing the Community preference, and on respect for the values that made our civilisation so great: fatherland, freedom, work, family, and security in all its forms, including economic and social security.

 Following the adoption of the second rail package concerning freight, the Commission has proposed nothing less than the total liberalisation of all international rail passenger services by 2010 and national services by 2017. This ultraliberal acceleration is happening at a time when the viability of the liberalisation of French rail freight is being called into question. The French national railway company, SNCF noted in December 2006 that, despite European-level measures aimed at reducing road transport, the volume of rail freight has been in freefall. What impact will the third package have? We are heading straight towards all too predictable economic and social failure, to which our European leaders should be alert, if only by recalling the disastrous experience of the liberalisation of the British railways in 1993. Let us not make the same mistakes by favouring anti-national ideology at the expense of national jobs, and let us preserve unified French railways. To liberalise the railways is to jeopardise safety. We will have too many private operators on the same rail network. Safety considerations should always prevail over simple return on investments. In view of their importance, the railways should remain a public service, which must of course be viable, but above all must be safe.

A proposal has been made to change the ‘SIS’ Schengen Information System which, although described as a success, will be unable to function with more than 18 Member States. According to the pro-Europeans, ‘SIS II’ ought therefore to become a highly technologically advanced system and to enable the new Member States, too, to apply the Schengen acquis in full by abolishing the controls at the internal borders with their neighbours. Conceived at the beginning from the universally appealing angle of cooperation among Member States, in particular of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, one might wonder today about the risks of the federalist and totalitarian excesses to which such a tool might give rise. This potential European big brother actually possesses the most extensive database on people, with more than 15 million entries containing information, including people’s surnames and first names, physical characteristics and lost, stolen or embezzled banknotes. Besides the fact that such a concentration of information could constitute a threat to people’s privacy and freedom of thought, it is justifiable to fear SIS II going beyond its principal task of police and judicial cooperation and one day becoming the self-proclaimed informer of the pro-European and pro-globalisation system.

Unlike the rapporteur, I do not believe that globalisation is an opportunity for France and Europe. The financial profits of multinationals are one thing; the economic and social profits in terms of employment and the protection of Europe’s industrial fabric are quite something else. The creation of a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, disguised as a desire to compensate for relocations, will be just another bureaucratic and demagogic tool. If the pro-Europeans had wanted to be more effective and straight with themselves, they should have thought instead about improving and enhancing the European Social Fund. I, for my part, believe that only the application of preference and of national and Community protection can save our jobs by redefining fair world trade rules. This Adjustment Fund is, moreover, unacceptable, not least because it is aimed at undermining the work of the Member States, the thinking being that efforts to promote solidarity should only be made at European Union level and no longer at national or regional level. Economic analgesics of this kind will not ease the social suffering of our people. The day is coming when they will ask for explanations.

The current enlargement strategy that consists in gathering together forty-odd Member States into one group will lead the Europe of Brussels to suffer the fate of Jean de la Fontaine's frog which, in its desire to make itself as big as an ox, bursts. This will happen for two reasons. The first is due to the fact that, having been given no geographical boundary, this Europe, after having let in Turkey, will have no grounds to refuse the entry of other Asian or African countries. The second reason is linked to the ideological nature of the Euro-Brussels project, which is aimed at crushing the identity and sovereignty of the European nations in order to build on their ruins a centralised superstate, the administration of which will be even more burdensome than the national administrations. Rather than dissolving our nations into this supranational whole, which is destined, like the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia before it, to disappear, let us build a great Europe of free, sovereign nations, united by the humanist and Christian values that made our civilisation great.

This report accomplishes the amazing feat of making an illusory distinction between human trafficking and illegal immigration. The fact is that, since the disastrous 1985 Schengen agreements abolishing the European Union’s internal border controls, these two phenomena – which no one doubts are closely linked – have developed at an exponential rate. Ever since Europe took it upon itself, on behalf of the Member States, to implement ‘an area of freedom, security and justice’, the criminal gangs, the pimps and the organised smuggling rings have made profits such as they have never made before. These networks are multiplying and prospering by exploiting more and more human beings. In a bid to find a solution to these human tragedies, the Commission and Parliament are proposing to organise political dialogues among States and to introduce yet more programmes and cooperation plans. What is the use in doing that? It is high time we tackled the real causes of human trafficking and illegal immigration: the lack of secure, protected borders in Europe. It is true, however, that it is impossible for our Eurocrats to challenge the sacrosanct rule of free movement of persons!

Despite a few improvements, despite a few additional sectors being excluded from the scope of application or, rather, of annoyance, of the first version of the Bolkestein Directive, this text, in its new draft, remains fundamentally unacceptable. It remains an open door to social dumping and to unfair competition among workers. It does not, in fact, resolve any of the problems raised by the original directive. It does not exclude public services and does not safeguard the right of the Member States to determine the way in which these services are defined, organised and funded. It denies the legitimate, economic, social or other requirements that these very Member States can impose on access to an activity, and only acknowledges the possibility for them to invoke ‘overriding requirements of the general interest’, a vague concept that the Court in Luxembourg will take it upon itself to interpret in the most restrictive way possible. It subordinates respect for the labour law of the Member State in which the service is provided to respect for Community law and, more specifically, for the free provision of services principle laid down in the Treaties, a move that amounts to denying the application of this national law. Several million Europeans rejected this ultraliberal Europe, which scorns men and nations and prioritises market laws, financial interests and sacrosanct competition. Listen to them before it is too late!

 Since the euro was introduced seven years ago, the purchasing power of the people of Europe has fallen considerably. In the 'Euro zone', we have seen a real increase in prices for household goods and leisure, and an even clearer trend in housing due to a lack of monitoring of speculative funds. It is therefore the working and middle classes who are hardest hit, even without adding excess debt to the mix. Economic growth in the 'Euro zone' has even fallen: the GDP volume has gone from an increase of 1.8% in 2004 to an increase of 1.4% in 2005. The prospects for 2007-2013 are even more worrying, because the Euro will present a greater risk to European growth once the exchange rate with the dollar becomes too favourable. Not only does this bank, with its ultra-European foundations and philosophy, demonstrate a democratic deficit and a certain lack of transparency, but it will not even achieve any of the European Union's economic and social objectives. These indicators should make it clear that we should get out of the Euro zone and that the individual nations should regain their competence for economic, social and monetary decision-making in a free Europe where protection and national and Community preference take first place.

 As early as at first reading, in April 2006, we came out against this report, so significant were the absurdities that it contained. This proposal at second reading is no worse. It is quite simply unacceptable. With a total budget of EUR 190 million, this programme is, indeed, a new propaganda tool in the service of the European Union. We could, without a doubt, find better uses for this sum – I am thinking, in particular, of the social sphere, agricultural aid and business creation – than to allocate it to this vague and artificial notion of European citizenship. Couched entirely in black and white terms, the document concerned is brilliant at pointing out to us what is desirable, namely to be an enthusiast of active European values; what is bad, namely to be a passive citizen; and what is worse, namely to be a Eurosceptic. Whatever happens after the inevitable approval of this report and the wasting of all that money by various associations, we shall all remain, above all, nationals of one country or another and proud to be so.

 The European Union is worried that the industrial powerhouses of China and India are taking protectionist measures against our exports by using trade defence instruments. The United States, therefore, is no longer Europe's only economic competitor – we are also up against Brazil, other countries in South America and Australia. The WTO, which should be acting as a global regulator, is not only powerless but complicit. Thus, the bubble of ultraliberal globalisation is about to burst. Unlimited, unregulated speculation on goods, commodities and people has now reached its limit. Having achieved spectacular economic growth, the emerging economies are now consolidating and protecting themselves, with a view to overtaking us one day if we do not react quickly enough. During this time, the ultra-Europeans in Brussels have been recommending that we open up our borders more and more and keep helping the whole world blindly and with no checks and balances, forgetting our fellow citizens. We must follow the example of the new world powers by establishing protection and Community preference in Europe and protection and national preference in France.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight to have Europe’s Christian roots written into the prologue of the European Constitution will have brought into conflict, throughout the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, the most hardened proponents of secularism, headed by Mr Michel and Mr Chirac, on the one side, and certain countries such as Poland, Italy or Portugal, supported by no less prestigious a figure than Pope John-Paul II, on the other. In the end, the atheist and Masonic lobbies won the day, thereby turning their backs on Europe’s past and its magnificent Christian civilisation. This was no doubt in order to pave the way for Turkey’s accession to the EU. Think, ladies and gentlemen, of the terrible sentence addressed by Cardinal Pie, a great Bishop of Poitiers, to Emperor Napoleon III: ‘If the time for Jesus Christ to reign has passed, then the time for governments to reign has also passed’. Three years later, there was Sedan. A Europe without memory, which is unfaithful to its past and deprived of its Christian soul, is a Europe without a future, condemned to the worst depths of servitude.

A fortnight ago the European Parliament adopted a report on a common immigration policy for Europe, thus paving the way for what had already been planned by the European Commission: mass immigration. Today it is the turn of asylum seekers; the idea is to establish a ‘Europe of asylum’. Indeed, the clearly stated objective is to ensure higher standards of treatment for asylum seekers with regard to their reception conditions. That means not only standardising minimum reception conditions among all the Member States but also providing support for asylum seekers to settle in huge numbers. To this end, the scope of this future directive will be extended to all persons legally or illegally entering European Union territory. The administrative restrictions that exist in the Member States with regard to labour market access will have to be completely abolished. Social, medical, psychological and housing assistance, as well as legal assistance, will have to be provided by the hosting Member State. Refusal of such assistance will be subject to legal appeals and investigations…that is often not the case for nationals themselves … By adopting this second phase of the ‘asylum package’, Brussels is facilitating and encouraging global immigration to Europe. We shall always oppose this internationalist vision, the sole aim of which is purely and simply to destroy the peoples and nations of Europe.

 Bus and coach passengers should enjoy rights similar to those of rail and air passengers. That is the philosophy contained in this report. In fact, and as a matter of principle, all passengers must be equal before the law. However, there are many reservations to be made. They arise from the very nature of this sector, which is dominated by micro-enterprises and SMEs. We cannot be satisfied with measures such as those proposed in plenary which, on the pretext of increased protection for passenger rights, merely introduce unmanageable restrictions for bus and coach drivers and inevitable fare increases for the passengers themselves. Why should we expect a driver, whose job it is to drive safely, to take a special course that will allow him or her to provide assistance to persons with reduced mobility or disabilities? Why not give a clear-cut exemption from the scope of this new European regulation to regular urban, suburban and regional transport services, which are themselves covered by public service contracts? Why seek to create rights to compensation to a value of 200% of the ticket price in cases where boarding is refused because of overbooking? In France, the Fédération nationale des transporteurs de voyageurs
 has proposed pragmatic solutions to all these problems. Some have been heard. Not all. That is a shame.

In 2008, 165 trawlers were scrapped. In 2009, it has already been announced that 225 will go. The fisheries sector in France is suffering greatly because the French Government and Brussels have decided to sacrifice French fishermen for the sake of European economic and trade policy. Thus, Norway, a country outside the European Union, but which has negotiated gas-related economic agreements with the latter, awards itself alone 80% of the cod quota, a figure amounting to 500 000 tonnes per year. France, for its part, has access to only 9 000 tonnes per year, of which only 700 tonnes come from the English Channel and the North Sea. How, under these circumstances, can one fail to feel disgust at witnessing the eradication of French fishermen? Why are Brussels and the French Government thus striving to plot the destruction of an entire sector of our economy? Euro-globalist interests and the dogma of free trade are why. It is not the EUR 4 million envelope promised by the minister for agriculture and fisheries, intended as financial compensation linked to the stopping of boats that have reached their quota of fish, that will solve this problem. There is an urgent, crucial need to free French fishermen from these discriminating and destructive European quotas.

A common immigration policy based on facilitating the opening up of legal immigration channels cannot receive our support. The policy should be the polar opposite of this. This report is based, once again, on the dangerous recommendations of the Commission that appear in the latter’s Green Paper of 11 January 2005 devoted to economic migration. It is a report that puts the number of migrant workers that the EU will supposedly need by 2050 at 60 million and that accordingly stresses the need to open up channels for legal migration. How can one fail to find it obscene that, in the midst of an economic, financial and social crisis, we are being recommended to open up our markets further to foreign workers, at a time when our national jobs are under threat and unemployment is raging? In the midst of a crisis, what is needed, instead, is to apply economic and social protectionist measures and to reserve jobs, but social aid too, for nationals. To conclude, this report is based on the false assumption that, by opening the floodgates for legal immigration, illegal immigration will fall considerably or disappear altogether. We know that no such thing will happen and that, on the contrary, legal immigration is the forerunner of full-scale immigration.

 Since 2000, the European Union has continually promoted equality, and this increasingly in the broadest possible sense of the word: equality between men and women, between nationals and foreigners, between the sick and the healthy, between Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists and other religions, equality of access to education, to health, equality for one’s sexual orientation, and so on. In short, the list is evidently not exhaustive, and the European directives currently being drafted concern equal access to social services and housing. Here then is a new directive that, under the guise of the legitimate fight against discrimination towards disabled people, is intended to regulate, or rather shackle, almost every area in which the freedom of choice, be it contractual or otherwise, still exists. The pitfalls in such a coercive regulation are legion. In effect, these new European measures will not only increase European bureaucracy and burdens, but will also be a real threat to other fundamental freedoms and rights including, in particular, freedom of worship, of association and of expression, and freedom of the press. In the name of equality, the censors and the dictators are here present.

Mr President, Commissioner, between 2007 and 2013 regional policy will become the main heading in the European Union’s budget with EUR 347 billion allocated to the Structural Funds. Will this development help to protect our economies from the effects of the global economic crisis, as the Commission is claiming it will? Forgive me for having my doubts about this. Firstly, the increase in regional expenditure is penalising some Member States, and France in particular. This increase comes at the cost of the common agricultural policy (CAP), thus at the cost of French agriculture which, until recent years, was the main beneficiary of the CAP. Moreover, the proportion of the Structural Funds paid to French regions keeps on falling, the vast majority being given to Eastern Europe, destroyed by more than 40 years of communism. Thus France, which contributes 16% of European budget revenue, is giving more and more money to Brussels but getting less and less of it back. Above all, European regional policy, far from protecting its beneficiaries from the economic crisis, is making it worse, as it forms part of the ultra-free market logic of the Lisbon Strategy. The Commission’s proposed changes to the management of the Structural Funds will therefore not enable our nations to tackle this crisis, which is the consequence of the ill-considered opening up of borders and the deregulation of the financial markets. Now more than ever we need to build a new Europe, a Europe of sovereign nations founded on the following three principles: economic and social patriotism, European protectionism and Community preference.

Internet use and development are without doubt a source of important progress, especially where freedom of expression and democracy are concerned. Striking a balance between such freedom, the protection of privacy and the need for Internet security represents a real challenge for us all. This is particularly the case where political action is concerned. Indeed, some people on the opposition side or who may hold controversial political views do not have access to the various media and see in the Internet an opportunity to convey their message throughout the world. Such freedom should not be censored. China, Cuba and Burma, as true totalitarian states, have no hesitation in gagging such freedom of expression by systematically censoring and filtering information with contempt for all the principles of democracy and freedom. Internet filtering for the sake of combating pornography, child pornography and terrorism is crucial, but such vigilance must be strictly defined and controlled.

It is a known fact that Europe wants to take care of everything and be everywhere. With this resolution on migrant children left behind in the country of origin, the European Parliament has reached the height of madness with proposals which are not only demagogic, but also aim at turning the Member States into the guilty parties. We are told that the Union has paid insufficient attention to the phenomenon of children left behind in their countries when their parents migrate. The Member States should implement measures aimed at improving the situation of these children left behind and guarantee them normal development, in terms of their education and social life. It is like being in a dream! After the measures encouraging the reuniting of families in the receiving countries and right of abode for the families themselves, now it is time for measures for the children who do not migrate. The problem of immigration will not be solved like this. The logic is wrong. It is not the children who stay behind who should be helped; it is the families and the entire populations from these countries who should be helped and encouraged to stay at home.

Like the previous reports on Turkey, the one by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten does not question the Euro-Brussels dogma that ‘Turkey must accede to the European Union’. Thus Mr Sarkozy, once again betraying his election promises, opened two chapters of the accession negotiations while he was presiding over the European institutions. However, our peoples reject the inclusion of this Asian country with a population that has become 99% Muslim since the Armenian genocide and the disappearance of the other Christian communities. This country is led by an Islamist party and its army is occupying the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union. They also remember that, over the centuries, the Turks have been the main threat to Europe. It was only in the 19th century that the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians and Serbs cast off the Ottoman yoke. The stubbornness of the Eurocrats in trying to give Turkey entry to Europe, as with their stubbornness in imposing the Treaty of Lisbon, shows the anti-democratic and anti-European nature of the Europe of Brussels.

Eight legislative texts making up a maritime package have just been adopted in the European Parliament. We welcome this because the package covers not only passenger compensation, but also inspections, State inspection of ports, investigations into transport accidents and the choice of the authority able to decide on the place of refuge for vessels in distress. The ball is now in the Member States’ court because it is not enough to legislate: this legislation needs to be transposed into their national laws. The first test will be to monitor the flags of convenience belonging to European countries. These flags are used to bypass the union, tax, recruitment, safety and environmental regulations of the countries to which the vessels really belong. Cyprus and Malta are still today among the top five flags of convenience in terms of the number of vessels lost. It is unfortunately notable that, despite the efforts made since the oil tankers Prestige
 and Erika
 sank, the situation has hardly improved. Substandard vessels sailing under flags of convenience are slashing transport prices. The so-called rich countries are responding by creating their own (mark II) flag to combat the loss of freight. In reality, if we are truly to get rid of these floating wrecks, the European Union must set about fighting ultra-liberalism.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, who have answered the big questions raised by the challenges of maritime safety and have faced up to our responsibilities. We all remember the disasters involving the petrol tanker Erika
 in 1999 and the Prestige
 in 2002, and their tragic ecological, human and economic consequences. A new arsenal of laws to protect Europeans from maritime disasters will now, finally, see the light of day, providing, in particular, for systematic inspections of the most antiquated ships, compulsory insurance to compensate the victims of ecological disasters, and also audits on the flags of European countries, which, as we know, are still far too often flags of convenience. It was high time to take these measures, which do indeed restrict the vast room for manoeuvre that shipowners have been allowed for centuries. They bring an end to the impunity of owners of hulks, and inspections will be made even more effective by being targeted at such ships. The safety of the seas and oceans is not up for negotiation: it is this, and not money, profit and unrestricted trade, that should be the primary reference value. I do have one regret. It is going to take a long time to implement all these new repressive and preventative laws. As an MEP for the North-West region, with its numerous shorelines, I am relieved and proud to be voting in favour of this third maritime package.

 There is no question for anyone acquainted with the arcane mysteries of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council that seeking access to information on the European Union’s institutions remains a journey full of pitfalls for the average citizen. There are many reasons for this. Indeed, it is just as much a question of the huge number of documents issued and the countless forms in which they are published (reports, opinions, resolutions, directives, regulations, and so on), as it is of the lack of simplification and clarity of the institutional registers and of the web pages and the lack of transparency and communication. This report rightly proposes resolving these kinds of problems by ensuring that the European institutions are more transparent. Indeed, this forms part of the wider issue of increasing the part played by citizens of the Union in the way in which the latter operates and understands matters. The peoples of Europe do not want systematically to be excluded from decisions that have a direct bearing on their everyday lives and in relation to which they have no right to inspect or to object. On the rare occasions when they have had their voices heard by referendum, they have disowned their leaders and Brussels bureaucracy, which is blind, deaf and unresponsive to their needs and wants. Making the European institutions more transparent is a first step towards a new Europe, a Europe of the peoples and a Europe of the sovereign nations.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the trialogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, the text adopted on 18 December on the pesticide package seems to be well-balanced. Indeed it takes account both of the interests of farmers and of the necessary protection of the environment, protected areas included. Having followed this matter closely, I am pleased with the result obtained, as it will allow farmers to pursue their economic activity without being penalised by the total elimination of pesticides and plant protection products, which will be strictly controlled. I would point out in this regard that the producers of acid fruits and vegetables in my region of Normandy have been at the cutting edge of agro-environmental practices for several years now. Fortunately the Council and Parliament have found an extremely useful area of agreement in this period of uncertainty, which has been made worse by the CAP’s closing balance sheet and by the threats hanging over the agricultural budget. To conclude, we will always stand by farmers in defending their tool of work and their irreplaceable role in society, which consists first and foremost in feeding their fellow men and then in preserving the countryside and in developing the land to everyone’s satisfaction. In the face of the irresponsible pressure exerted by ecologists, it is comforting that common sense has prevailed.

In recital B of this report it is written that ‘illegal immigration is a common European challenge’. Indeed, this is all the more true since, each month, illegal immigrants in search of a European Eldorado disembark on the Italian, Greek and Spanish coasts in their thousands. In the face of this challenge which, let us not forget, is principally a product of the Schengen Agreements – which abolished the controls at the internal border of the Member States – the Union’s response has been to create a European external border control agency: Frontex. Only yesterday just a gimmick without resources, personnel or power, it would seem that, today, Frontex’s remit allows it to provide its support to joint return operations and contributes in some, albeit small, way to the daily fight against illegal immigration. We should keep in mind, however, that there is no use in closing a few gaps allowing illegal immigrants to pass through if all the EU Member States do not react as one to denounce the Schengen Agreements and to re-establish real controls at all their borders, both on land and at sea.

This report concerning the cross-border use and the recognition of authentic acts presents risks of confusion in a variety of ways. Indeed, and above all, it should be specified that the concept of the authentic act does not exist in common law systems. In England and Wales, solicitors fulfil the role of notaries. There are also scrivener notaries. The latter cannot issue authentic acts and are only authorised to certify signatures. In its concern to harmonise the legal professions, the Commission attaches little importance to the differences relating to the very nature of the Member States’ legal systems. Unfortunately this political will does not contribute to legal certainty as a whole. Europe must protect the identity of its peoples and the values and traditions peculiar to each of its States. The biggest mistake would be for it to develop in a way that is detrimental to its peoples.

 The taxation, penalisation and systematic swindling of motorists seems to know no bounds. We know, in reality, that this is not a matter of penalising those who drive badly, but those who drive frequently. The sad and unfortunate obligation on police to meet ‘quotas’ and ‘turnover’ only exacerbates frequently excessive police clampdowns. Furthermore, even though there are a great many differences in the conditions for confiscating a driving licence among the Member States, and the systems for the scale of offences and fines in the field of road safety vary from one country to another, Europe wants to establish an electronic system for Member States to exchange information relating to offences committed on their territory, and in order to penalise motorists even more. While we can, of course, only welcome a reduction in the number of road accidents, it is important to ensure that these new legislative measures are not accompanied by attacks on freedoms, or unlawful, inappropriate or unfair measures.

 If there is one field where cooperation between the Member States of the European Union is important and needs to be supported with all our might, it is this one concerning justice and the police. The recent results achieved by the joint Franco-Belgian investigative team, which, after months of surveillance, has succeeded in arresting 16 young Jihadist fanatics and in dismantling an Islamist terrorist network based in Brussels, provide evidence of the need for collaboration between the police forces of Europe. Organised crime, corruption, drug trafficking and terrorism, as we all know, do not respect national borders. The Member States of the European Union have already been collaborating for a number of years in the context of intergovernmental cooperation. In its sinful pride, the European Union wants to jump on the bandwagon and is trying to set up, under its rule, this type of relationship within a European Judicial Network arranged around national contact points. We remain in favour of cooperation, and we support this initiative, provided that the Member States are not deprived of their legitimate sovereign competences for the sake of a new bureaucratic European body.

The EU Blue Card, a real open sesame designed to generate additional qualified immigration from outside Europe, will be an economic, social and humanitarian disaster for the people and nations of Europe already suffering in the face of illegal immigration which is out of control and legal immigration which is increasing exponentially. In order to prevent the inevitable social dumping which the arrival of engineers or other qualified specialists from other continents would entail, their salary will need to be at least 1.7 times higher than the minimum salary in the host country. That will go down well with French blue collar workers. Immigrant workers will also be able to bring their families over under a fast-track procedure, thereby favouring family reunification, never mind how widespread and dangerous it is already. Moreover, immigrants will be able to accumulate periods of presence on European territory in order to obtain the status of long-term resident. The circle has been closed: the conditions of mass establishment and naturalisation in the Member States are in place. What is also scandalous is that this will aggravate the brain drain from third countries, especially Africa, by capturing their elite and guaranteeing their impoverishment once again. Once again the people of Europe will not be consulted on this globalist and immigrationist policy by Brussels. Now more than ever our fight must be that of rediscovered sovereignty and of the right of the people to stay as they are.

 On 13 October 1981, in the chamber of the French National Assembly, André Laignel, a socialist MP, issued his famous retort to opposition MPs, arguing that the nationalisation sought by the government was unconstitutional. In it he claimed that they were changing the debate from a legal one to a political one and, although they were entitled to do so, in this case, they were in the wrong legally, since they were in the minority politically. The European Parliament has clearly taken this phrase to heart since it is getting rid of all those who dare to bother it with political views that are deemed not to be sufficiently federalist or pro-European for its tastes. My colleague, Mr Vanhecke, is the target of a veritable witch-hunt within this European Parliament, to which he was legitimately elected. This institution is totally wrong and disgraced in accepting the unacceptable: lynching one of its members by flouting all the legal principles and legal protections relating to parliamentary immunity that are currently in force.

Our Parliament is at last recognising the horror of the extermination by famine – the Holomodor – instigated in the Ukraine by the Soviet regime. It is regrettable, however, that it has not taken the Ukrainian Parliament’s lead and described this mass crime as a genocide. Indeed, the famine, which killed millions of Ukrainians between 1932 and 1933, did not result exclusively from the economic and social absurdity of communism; it was the fruit of an extermination plan fitting the definition of a genocide, that is to say: ‘the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such’, and also ‘deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part’. At a time when, in France, in particular, a certain middle-class communist left extreme is benefiting from media support, recognition of a genocide such as this would make it possible to remember the horrors of Marxism-Leninism, which has been responsible for the deaths of 200 million human beings since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and which is today still oppressing over one and a half billion people, in Cuba, in North Korea, in Vietnam and, above all, in China, where the most uncontrolled form of capitalism combines very well with communist totalitarianism.

 According to the Internet Watch Foundation, an English organisation which fights the possession and dissemination of child pornography images, the online sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes is a growing sector which is low-risk and highly profitable. Indeed, the sale of these images on the Internet constitutes a vile trade worth billions of euros. We endorse the approach of the Commission and our fellow Member in wanting to put a stop to this kind of activity, in particular, by establishing a blocking mechanism for credit card or electronic payments when child pornography images are bought on the Internet. Unfortunately, there is currently a serious technical limitation to all the national and European protection mechanisms being developed. In fact, most commercial servers offering these images are not located in Europe, but in the United States, Russia and Asia. Therefore, their illegal content can easily be uploaded in one country and viewed in another. It is therefore understandable that effective means to counter the development of Internet paedophilia, while necessary, are problematical.

The Commission has just published its 24th annual report on its control of application of Community law by the Member States. The quite legitimate question that can be asked is: are there any differences or progress in relation to the previous report? It would seem not. As always, the poor students of Europe are the Member States. What solution is proposed by the rapporteur? More firmness with regard to the Member States, more submissions to the Court of Justice if necessary and more firmness in executing the decisions pronounced by the Court. In a word: more powers of coercion and repression for European institutions in relation to the Member States. The Community legal order, already set up with treaties that take precedence over national rights, now wants to be more and more oppressive and destructive of the said rights of the Member States. We are resolutely hostile to this, since the enfeoffment of national rights and legal specificities will surely lead to enfeoffment of the Member States themselves in a Europeist and federalist project.

 The objective of encouraging economic immigration on a huge scale, already set out on 11 January 2005 by the European Commission in its ‘Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration’ is more topical than ever, given this report. No fewer than EUR 950 million have been appropriated to the Erasmus Mundus II programme for the period 2009-2013. This programme is intended to attract foreign students and teachers to the geographical area of the European Union. That is some EUR 654 million more than the amount appropriated to the first version of the programme. Under the pretext – laudable in itself – of encouraging students from third countries to come to study in Europe by offering them high-level master’s degrees or doctorates, what in reality are being opened up are the floodgates for a new channel of legal immigration. Easier access to Europe will, in fact, be given to foreigners from third countries by means, in particular, of simplified procedures for obtaining visas and scholarships and modified tuition fees. Far from favouring its own nationals and encouraging the European research and excellence it needs, the European Union is again favouring those from outside the EU and exhibiting its penchant for immigration on a huge scale.

On reading this rapport, one question comes to mind: is it because the ‘first generation’ Schengen Information System did not work or was at least ineffective as a means of ensuring security within the Schengen area that a ‘second generation’ system, intended to remedy these shortcomings, is being implemented? Sadly not, as this second-generation system is no more than an updated version of an already flawed system. According to the figures given by the Commission, 400 000 illegal immigrants cross the Union’s borders each year. Even supposing that biometric data will soon be available and ready to use to establish files for and send home illegal immigrants already registered as such, the European Union would be incapable of putting an end to the mass immigration that takes place along its coasts and land borders because of a lack of controls at the Member States’ internal and external borders. The Schengen Information System will only ever be a useless gadget as long as the dangerous Schengen agreements are in place.

Europe wishes to protect itself against maritime accidents and the pollution of its seas and oceans. We welcome this. The recent terrible examples of the Prestige
 and Erika
 shipwrecks are there to remind us of our duty to be careful and to monitor vessel safety, but also of our responsibilities in the event of an environmental disaster. A special reference should, moreover, be made in the proposal for a Directive to post-accident inquiries. For the first time, it has been agreed that an investigative body should be set up that is charged with deciding, with complete independence and impartiality, whether or not to open an inquiry to determine the causes and circumstances of an accident. The intentions are good; let us only hope that they are not cast aside in the face of the huge financial interests at stake.

 There are sometimes fortunate, perhaps even amusing, coincidences. Indeed, we are taking the opportunity given to us by this annual report on equality between men and women, coming at the same time as the French Presidency of the European Union, to highlight a marginal but entertaining point which is at worst a lack of tact and at best a perfect application of the principle of equality between women and men, which means not discriminating between them. A few days ago, on the occasion of the start of Mr Sarkozy’s Presidency, which received such a lot of media attention, MEPs were given gifts. In the free document wallet, notably there was a tie. Of the 785 MEPs, nearly a third are women. Were they not entitled to a small personalised gift too, or are we supposed to conclude from this that women also have to wear ties? It still seems to be the case that, when big debates are taking place on the role and position of women in political life, boorish behaviour very often still gets the better of courteousness.

. – Mr President, by taking an unequivocal position against Russia and engaging Europe in the resolution of the conflict, the European Council and a majority in Parliament are launching a process as dangerous as the one which plunged the continent into the First World War. This process is the result of the ill-prepared enlargements to the East, which bring us closer to the conflict zones of the Balkans and the Caucasus. What then will the consequences of Turkey’s membership be, which borders Iraq and Iran? Furthermore, by recognising the independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, our governments have opened a Pandora’s box, challenging the territorial integrity not only of Georgia, but of most of the European countries, both East and West. If, as the Socialists, Liberals, PPE and Verts would like, Georgia became a member of NATO and joined a European Union governed by the Treaty of Lisbon, our nations would enter into conflict with Russia. The Europe of Brussels signifies war. More than ever, faced with a more powerful China and the Islamist threat, it is time to build another Europe, the Europe of sovereign states, united with Russia through the bonds of civilisation constituted by our Greek and Christian heritage.

 It is with some irony that we note that, for the first time, a European Parliament report describes the massive influx of immigrants into an EU Member State as a ‘burden’. Should immigration not be more of an opportunity that is beneficial to all the peoples of Europe? Let there be no doubt about this: the absurdity of the obligation to take in asylum seekers and strict compliance with the principle of non-refoulement
 are not being called into question. The report highlights only the deficiencies of the Dublin system with regard to the determination of which Member State is responsible for processing asylum applications. This is self-evident given the ever-increasing migration flows to countries that, for the most part, are located on the southern periphery of the EU. Once again, the report offers a fallacious solution to the technical and human problems associated with migration waves. The establishment of a common asylum system, which is bound to be ineffective in a constantly enlarging EU with porous borders, is not what is needed. Quite the reverse, Member States should be given the right to take their own decisions on migration and the management of their borders.

 Although it would like to be able to boast the opposite, Europe has made no progress in the area of freedom, security and justice. Quite the contrary, since the deplorable Schengen Agreement was first implemented, the lifting of internal border controls has led to an explosion in organised crime and all forms of trafficking. The European Union, a real sorcerer’s apprentice in terms of security, with methods that all too often pose a threat to the security of states and their peoples, has imposed on us this area of insecurity lacking in freedoms and justice. The Schengen Borders Code will not help because it is the very foundations of the Schengen Agreement that are inadequate and unacceptable. Common security will prevail only if each state regains full sovereignty in the management of its borders and its migration policy. The pinnacle of the absurd is reached when this involves transferring even more responsibilities to a Union that is already paralysed.

 Just for once, Brussels wants to take back through the window what the French, Dutch and Irish threw out the door in the 2005 and June 2008 referendums: the establishment of a single European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The temptation proves too great for our pro-European sorcerer’s apprentices. Whatever it takes, any objections, rejections and legitimate resistance by the peoples of Europe must be overcome and ignored in order to communitise by force all justice, security and immigration issues. Europe is sorely mistaken. The requisite cooperation between Member States in judicial, police and even criminal matters must not result in their subjection to a supranational legal order that has been established in spite of all the differences existing between the legal systems and traditions of the Member States. We reject this supranational legal order that would go against the very principles and values that we hold dear.

 In the light of the recent Erika 
and Prestige 
disasters, human error has emerged as a serious aspect of maritime safety. Good training for crews is therefore essential. In this regard I should like to raise two aspects that I consider fundamental. The first concerns the very logic behind Europe’s approach: the refusal to promote in any way whatsoever the recruitment of seamen from Member States. Indeed, far from showing a Community preference, as in all economic and social areas, the recruitment of non-EC seamen is encouraged. This deliberately anti-national approach can only increase the current shortage of qualified seamen in the EU and the lack of interest which is emerging for this difficult and dangerous profession. All of this in favour of under-qualified, cheap labour from Asia. Secondly, we need to safeguard ourselves to the maximum, in terms of quality of training, its supervision and the issuing of certificates. Instead of mutual recognition of qualifications based on minimum, non-EC technical standards, we should recognise the true value of our existing qualifications and save our marine professions in the name of maritime safety and the protection of our national jobs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations are due to Mr Piecyk for his excellent report on the Integrated Maritime Policy, and also to my colleague Mr Jarzembowski for his pertinent remarks. Madam President, this report has the great merit of incorporating the various different aspects of this policy: environmental, economic, social and safety aspects. In particular, I am referring to the problems associated with illegal immigration, terrorism and smuggling, which occur along the full 320 000 kilometres of European coastline. The Member States with coastline need to step up the surveillance and control of their seas. Cooperation between them and the countries from which these illegal activities originate absolutely must be implemented as quickly as possible. It is also true that scientific discoveries, the considerable progress of technology, globalisation, climate change and maritime pollution are changing considerably Europe’s relationship with the seas and oceans, with all the problems and challenges this brings. However, I am disappointed that the text proposed to us does not cover policy on ports and fisheries in more detail. These are two particularly sensitive dossiers, as we know. In France, professional fishermen are blockading the Atlantic, Channel and Mediterranean ports in reaction of course to the sudden rise in diesel prices and the quotas policy imposed by Brussels. The sector is in crisis structurally as much as economically. Fishing bosses no longer want to invest in their boats so the fleet is ageing. The average age of French fishing vessels is 25 years. Fewer and fewer people are going into a career in fishing because of the constraints on the profession. Madam President, an integrated maritime policy has to take these sectoral considerations and problems into account and quickly reverse the trend that is leading to the slow and painful death of the fishing sector.

France is very concerned about the European Union’s policy on the outermost regions. It is essential that the specific characteristics of these regions be taken into account, much more and much better than they are now, by the politicians in Brussels, especially: - through trade policy, as production by the outermost regions is in competition with that of the neighbouring countries that benefit from highly preferential conditions from the EU; - through immigration policy, as these regions are particularly vulnerable to immigration and the influx of illegal immigrants is creating economic and social problems there that are far beyond the local capacity to overcome them; - through provisions concerning State aid and especially by maintaining the tax exemptions that these regions benefit from, which are periodically called into question in the name of European law. I am particularly worried about the legal ambiguity that exists regarding Saint-Barthélemy: this small French island has been a territorial authority since 2007, and when it changed its status it wanted to preserve the tax exemption that is essential for its economic survival. However, the EU appears to consider it to be among the outermost regions, in other words a territory of the Union that is subject to Community law. It would be unacceptable for this ambiguity to put at risk the desire for autonomy that was clearly expressed by 95% of the population.

The Castex report on the demographic future of Europe is appallingly trite, featuring all the clichés one might expect to find in surveys on the subject. Mrs Castex forgets, among other aspects, to mention contraceptive methods which have been largely responsible for reducing the birth rate in Europe, where it stands at only 1.5 per woman, a far cry from renewal of the future generations. A population-friendly environment depends on the possibility of women being willing to bring up their children over a relatively long period of time. This is a priority investment for society, and would substantially reduce school dropout rates and juvenile delinquency. As for immigration to offset empty cradles, this is a dangerous idea which would not only destabilise our western societies, but could be a genuine time bomb with all the consequences we can well imagine. Justifying immigration by a lack of manpower, qualified or unqualified, when Europe has over twenty million unemployed, is penalising European workers, who will certainly appreciate the proposals of the Commission or the European Parliament. For these reasons we intend to vote against the Castex report.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report proposes nothing more and nothing less than to give the European Police Office, Europol, a new status by modifying its existing legal bases. Indeed, the intention is to replace the Europol Convention concluded in 1995 between the Member States with a Council decision converting the agency from an intergovernmental body into a European Union agency financed from the Community budget and applying the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities. The reasons given for this radical change of status are the extension of the mandate of Europol's activities beyond just organised crime and the Member States’ inability to meet these new and very extensive objectives adequately. These objectives will obviously be better met at European Union level, the Council assures us. But this is all smoke and mirrors. The reality is that we are already engaged with the requirements and application of the Treaty of Lisbon, which transfers almost all of justice and home affairs policy to a qualified majority of the Council of Ministers. Until now, these fields of judicial and police cooperation have required unanimity. The reality is that our national and European leaders are in the process of imposing on us institutional reforms that all work towards a more deeply supranational and bureaucratic model. It is these same reforms that are in the Treaty of Lisbon that were rejected by the French and Dutch in the referendums of May and June 2005. The people have been duped, misled and treated with contempt. Europe cannot be built contrary to its people and contrary to national realities, and it is high time that our pro-European political class realised this and finally left Europe to construct itself from the nations’ and people’s rights to identity, sovereignty, freedom and security.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that rail transport has always been the poor relation compared with road transport. Indeed, with regard to goods traffic, rail has been losing the battle in every country in Europe. I am pleased to say that the situation today looks set to improve, particularly since the Commission’s decision – as part of the first Railway Package – that at least 40% of spending on transport should go to the railways. Infrastructure, in particular, needs to benefit from this spending because all the closures of non-profitable railway lines have resulted in road transport taking over a significant proportion of both freight and passenger traffic. Of my colleague Dirck Sterckx’s report concerning rail passengers’ rights and obligations I would say that it is essentially sound, focusing as it does on the protection of passengers, with measures including compensation when trains are late, a right to transport for people with reduced mobility, and carrier liability for passengers and their baggage. However, one point of major importance to all families appears to have been completely lost in this report. I am talking about the right to reduced ticket prices for large families. Certain Member States of the Union already have this system whereby a card entitles large families to reductions of between 50% and 75% depending on the number of children – France is one example – yet curiously there are no proposals or even plans for such an arrangement in the draft regulation. However, if we want to step up the development of passenger traffic on the railways, this measure, which is attractive not only financially but also in terms of savings on travel time in comparison with road transport, would undoubtedly give us a strong card in the rail-versus-road battle.

 For once the Commission proposal aimed at harmonising the rules for the transport of dangerous goods is a step in the right direction. Indeed the proposed text aims to simplify and unify existing Community legislation. Currently no less than four directives and many Commission decisions govern the transport of dangerous goods by land (rail, road) and inland waterways. This disparate collection means that the rules are too complex, difficult to transpose into national legislation and often obsolete. This is a particularly important subject because the volume of inland transport in the EU is constantly increasing, as is the volume of dangerous goods. Nearly 110 billion tonnes/km/year of these goods are transported annually in the EU, amounting to 8% of all goods transported. Because of its strategic position as the crossroads of Europe, France’s road, rail and waterway networks are often congested and therefore particularly subject to transport accidents. It is high time all the peripheral, excessive EU legislation on this matter was eliminated to enable the various operators, but also the national authorities, to guarantee and fully strengthen the safety of this type of transport.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost please allow me, on behalf of the ITS Group, to express my condolences and support for the families of the victims and for the Greek people as a whole. Sixty-three people dead, others disappeared, villages destroyed, 200 000 hectares burned, as my colleagues have already mentioned, tens of thousands of heads of cattle burned, with all the consequences this entails for the national economy, and local economies in particular, as yet unassessed: this is the sad result of the forest fires that have ravaged Greece since the end of August. The European Union, as usual, will be taking out its chequebook to assist with the rebuilding work and, as usual, it is using a tragic situation to propose an extension of its powers by creating a permanent European civil protection body. This, however, would have contributed nothing to the solidarity of the European countries that sent helicopters, water bomber units and fire-fighters to assist their Greek colleagues, as they did two years ago in Portugal, and as they will do in years to come whenever a Member State requires their assistance. As on every occasion the European Union is concealing its own responsibilities. Forest fire prevention policy has no autonomous financing and finds itself henceforth floundering around in the Life programme, which focuses on training, communication and statistical monitoring of fires in the small element on this issue. The Greeks are angry and they have every right to be, because the scale of this disaster is obviously the result of a number of human malfunctions: neglected undergrowth, poorly trained fire-fighters, insufficient facilities, no coordination of operations, inadequate town planning policies, calls for assistance arriving too late and, in particular, no prevention facilities. This is all the more staggering in the case of a Mediterranean country where fires and drought are common occurrences, and which was going through its third heat wave since the beginning of the year. There was no realisation that, in due consideration of the climate characteristics, there ought to have been a genuine air force of water bombers. It is not, however, only Mr Karamanlis’s Government that must be singled out here, even if its wait-and-see attitude during the initial days was particularly scandalous: only 1 000 fire-fighters, only 440 soldiers. Certain parties must be singled out, and the blame also lies with its socialist predecessors, the PASOK. New Democracy and its allies are collectively responsible for the insufficient human and material fire-fighting resources, but also for the absence of something fit to be called a fire prevention policy. The terrible recent catastrophe in Greece merely points, unfortunately, to a failure in the system, and in a few days the Greek people will have the chance to chastise a compromised political class and choose others to make political decisions. Let us hope they make the right choice!

In France, La Poste
 is not an ordinary company; it is a State enterprise, run by revolutionary trade unionists. It is a public service that is totally under the thumb of corporatist, private-sector, interests. Why strive to protect the public service provided by La Poste
 when, in reality, it is not one? The customer has nothing to say and the trade unions claim to act in his interests. The boss (the State) and the shareholders (every person in France) are petrified at the idea of seeing the system held up by certain workers who are represented by omnipotent and totalitarian trade unions. No opposition force is taking action to balance the rights and powers that these workers have granted themselves, and it is the general interest that is being scorned. Must La Poste 
be liberalised? Must damage be done to this totally corrupted system, which is aimed not at satisfying customers, but simply at becoming part of the private sector, demonstrating so-called 'acquired' benefits and demanding the preservation of those benefits? The answer is categorically: yes, and quickly. La Poste 
must now make huge efforts to make up for its major handicaps, which are: its huge wage bill, its pension burden and its complex, cumbersome, costly and failing organisation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the French elected representative of the large Nord-Ouest region, a region with many coastlines, I am naturally affected by issues relating to maritime safety. I therefore fully endorse the Commission initiative to create a mechanism, on the basis of a body of legislative texts, that is designed to protect Europe from the risks of pollution and maritime accidents. Indeed, in spite of the progress made since the sinking of the ‘Erika’ and the ‘Prestige’ – with, for instance, the compulsory inspections of ships in ports and even the demise of single-hull oil tankers – I believe that the accident prevention system remains inadequate. This sad view is unfortunately shared by professional seafarers’ trade unions, environmental protection associations and even by elected representatives from across the political spectrum. The main issue at stake is that of flags of convenience; despite the desire of the Commission and Parliament to reform them, there are still too many of them. Nearly 60% of the world fleet still sails under a flag of convenience, which, aside from the advantage of minimal taxation, offers the possibility of increasing the number of intermediaries, so that all liability can be avoided in the event of an accident or disaster. Furthermore, it permits the most lax of attitudes where ship safety and labour law are concerned. Finally, maritime safety should obviously be based on three responsibilities: that of the flag State, that of the charterer and that of the classification societies, which are responsible for surveying ships. These measures certainly appear in the third package on maritime safety. Let us hope, however, that they are implemented in practice, as this is unfortunately not always the case.

It is true that we still all too often witness air disasters that are due not only to the poor state of some aircraft but also to the violation of security requirements. The virtue of this proposal by Parliament and by the Council is that it increases the Member States’ obligations regarding inspections not only of third-country aircraft, but of EU aircraft, too. What is more, if an inspection of airlines or of the activities of civil aviation authorities reveals any anomalies or a violation of standard security rules, the European Aviation Safety Agency will have the power to set a penalty mechanism in motion and to ban the airlines at fault from transporting passengers within the Union. I believe that this is a significant step forward in terms of averting the risk of aircraft accidents. Finally, the work and remit of this Agency will make it possible to complete – usefully, I hope – the European blacklist of bad airlines. Although not all of the issues in the field of aviation security have been settled, it would seem that prevention and repression have at last been usefully brought together in this text. We shall vote in favour.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank, in particular, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for its excellent preparative work and its work in consulting the interested parties in the context of this important matter. What we are mainly concerned with here is the protection of the environment against marine pollution. The report that I am submitting to you today is about the accelerated introduction of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers. In particular, it is a question of putting an end to the exemptions that have existed since 2002. Indeed, after the ‘Prestige’ oil tanker went down in 2002, the Commission had decided, in accordance with the December 2002 regulation, to speed up the withdrawal of single-hull oil tankers. It was also a question of banning, with immediate effect, the carriage of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers bound for or leaving ports in a Member State of the European Union. At present, international maritime legislation specifies that a vessel flying the flag of a Member State may take advantage of the exemptions from this ban, insofar as - and this goes without saying - it is operating outside European ports. As Mr Barrot has just mentioned, it was at a meeting of the International Maritime Organisation that the Italian Presidency of the EU stated, on behalf of the 15 Member States, that the latter would not authorise their tankers to make use of this exemption from Regulation 13H. According to the Commission, it was therefore appropriate to amend the 2002 regulation by doing away with the last exemption to Regulation 13H and, therefore, to ban the carriage of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers flying the flag of a Member State, whatever the jurisdiction applicable to the ports, offshore terminals or maritime area in which these tankers operate. Only one European country – Greece – had refused to accept this political position adopted by the Italian Presidency, believing that this statement was not binding on it. It wished, it seems, to continue to authorise its single-hull tankers to operate outside European ports with, of course, heavy grades of oil on board. Finally, this objection was not renewed during the work done by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. The 25 Member States of the European Union have now agreed that not a single oil tanker carrying heavy grades of oil will any longer be authorised to fly the flag of a Member State if it is a single-hull vessel. In reality, this only confirms what is already complied with and applied by the vast majority of Member States. The absolute demand for compliance with the objective of maximum maritime safety has again prevailed in this matter, in the same way as the demand for a reduction in the risks of pollution by hydrocarbons. There are many pollution risks, which may vary in nature. Barely five days ago, in my region, toxic barrels were drifting between the Cotentin and the Atlantic. In the course of last Friday evening, these barrels had been lifted by a storm from the deck of a Swiss container on its way from Antwerp to Portugal. Admittedly, the new double-hull legislation constitutes a notable advance in the field of preventing marine pollution, but there is a need to continue issuing standards enabling tankers and merchant ships to offer the maximum number of safeguards. The motorways of the sea are a way of relieving congestion, but vessel safety must not be neglected under any circumstances. What is at stake here is the future of the whole planet. Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to emphasise that I am tabling a technical amendment, which also has the support of the European Commission, that prevents our having to change a series of cross-references. Being of a linguistic nature, this amendment only concerns the English version. It does not alter the substance of the text, and the Finnish Presidency has confirmed to us that it does not present any problem to the Council.

 If there is in fact an area in which Parliament and the European Commission have been mistaken, it is in the establishment of their so precious and sought-after ‘area of freedom, security and justice’. When the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted, we were promised a European area in which all freedoms would be present and effective and in which we would be protected from all insecurity. As we predicted, the opposite has occurred. With the abolition of border controls by the Schengen Agreement and the communitisation of policies on asylum and visas, levels of immigration, in particular illegal immigration, and insecurity have never been so high, and there have never been so many mafia groups and criminals. Today, Mr Cavada’s resolution proposes that we go further in handing over powers to the European Union in the field of immigration policy, by abolishing the unanimity rule in the Council. Once again, it is not by handing over these prerogatives of national sovereignty to the European Union that we will put an end to illegal immigration and the human tragedies associated with it. The main cause of these problems is linked to the abolition of Member States’ border controls. Let us re-establish these controls: then, and only then, will Member States be in a position to fight effectively against the huge influx of illegal immigrants and the many cross-border crimes.

Some of the points in Mr von Wogau's analysis coincide with our views, particularly those concerning the threats to Europe’s security, such as terrorism, the vulnerability of our oil supplies and the permeability of our borders. In fact, contrary to the assertions of our governments, which have dismantled the systems that used to defend our nations, the world has become more dangerous than it was before the Berlin Wall came down. The proposals contained in the report, however, are built on a second illusion, namely the idea that nations can rely on supranational bodies to guarantee their security. In actual fact, when the chips are down, a nation always stands alone. Today the United States devotes 3.5% of its GDP to defence, compared with the one per cent spent by the 25 Member States of the European Union. European harmonisation of defence equipment is certainly necessary, but do not let us dissolve our armed forces into a Eurocorps, in which orders would be given in 21 languages and which, via NATO, would be under US command. Let us rather strengthen the defence of each of our countries. Only independent nations, conscious of their identity, will make that effort. To that end, the soulless and borderless Europe of Brussels must first be replaced by a Europe of sovereign nations.

 Since the euro was introduced and the Member States’ national currencies correspondingly withdrawn, there is just one encouraging development to be noted: the reduction in counterfeiting. In 2005, the total number of counterfeit euro coins withdrawn from circulation was substantially lower than the total number of counterfeit coins in the former national currencies before the introduction of the euro. This is due, in particular, to the constructive cooperation between the anti-fraud office, or OLAF, the European Central Bank, Europol, Interpol and the competent national authorities. Beyond straightforward counterfeiting, there has also, however, been the recent emergence of new coins confusingly similar to two–euro coins. Since 1 January 2005, Turkey does, in fact, have a new coin, known as the ‘new Turkish lire’. Looking at the new one-lire coin, you can see that it is of exactly the same size and appearance as the two-euro coin. Is this a coincidence or a clever piece of counterfeiting? Wait and see ... The problem is that these Turkish coins are already circulating in Europe, no doubt in anticipation of Turkish accession to Europe, as announced by our leaders and eurocrats, regardless of the will of the nations themselves. Let us be vigilant. Turkey is closer than ever to our gates.

The plans are coming thick and fast, the European Fisheries Fund is replacing FIFG, the advisory committees are multiplying, and the Community Fisheries Control Agency is developing its activities, but none of that is leading to an improvement in the fishermen’s work situation. European legislation is in the process of killing off fishing and French fishermen just as agricultural legislation is going to force out our farmers. Two key problems have been overlooked in this report, even though, in the long term, they will determine whether or not the French fishing fleet stays: the unfair competition from non-EU fishing vessels that do not comply with all of the restrictions imposed on our fishermen in matters concerning legislation, control and monitoring, and the cost of fuel ever since Brussels called on France to do away with the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing, or fuel fund. The legislation certainly needs to be simplified, but that will do nothing to improve the situation of our fishermen. Once again, the European Commission is taking them for a ride, if I may say so. There now remain only 5 500 fishing vessels. How many will remain in 2010 with the new Common Fisheries Policy?

 Maritime transport represents approximately 45% of the European Union’s external trade in terms of value and almost 75% in terms of volume. Applying the general rules of competition law to international tramp services and cabotage does not in reality present any problem as these activities are already deregulated and operate on the basis of fair competition. It is abolishing the exemption, granted in 1986, of liner conferences from the competition rules that, alone, has been the subject of genuinely bitter discussions between all the players in this sector. I think that the solutions produced by Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s and my own reports in this regard are perfectly balanced and respect the interests at stake. Indeed, there is not at present any evidence that the liner conference sector needs to be protected from competition in order to provide its services. In order to preserve the legal certainty of the maritime sector, it seemed necessary, moreover, to lay down guidelines enabling operators to adapt to the new regulatory framework and to facilitate a smooth transition to a competitive regime. If all the precautions taken by Parliament in this matter are respected, there is no doubt that maritime transport will benefit.

 The report on inshore fishing is an excellent one, as it succeeds in identifying the problems facing fishermen involved in this kind of fishing and puts forward realistic and effective solutions. If we do not want fishing to disappear as so many other economic sectors have done before it, it is high time for us to take certain measures, such as strengthening the fisheries sector by setting up an inter-branch organisation to promote and develop fishery products from landing to direct sale, including a special heading for 'inshore fishing' in the future European Fisheries Fund, and increasing checks and sanctions in order to avoid unfair competition from third-country vessels that have lower costs and do not comply with the same safety standards. Paradoxically, consumption of fish is on the increase throughout the European Union, so now is not the time to drop our guard, particularly in view of the fact that inshore fishing is a very environmentally friendly job that consumes very little energy and supplies an important product. It must be aided and supported as a matter of priority, so as to restore its economic balance and protect maritime jobs.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is a proven fact that, when it comes to employment, men and women are not treated in the same way. The European Parliament has been concerned by this for years, and regularly publishes reports piously wishing for blessed egalitarian resolutions: incredibly labyrinthine systems and hot-air factories, as you will all appreciate. To be more serious, though, should our institution not concentrate more on reconciling the people with the political elite? One year on from the resounding 'no' votes from the French and the Dutch, it has to be said that nobody wants to be a part of this Europe run by the European Commissioners, of this globalised Europe, and that the chasm between what the eurocrats want and what the nations of Europe want is widening all the time. Instead of obstinately trying to cobble something together to get round the rejection of the European Constitution, should Brussels' plans and those of Parliament not finally take their inspiration from listening to and respecting the people?

Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the proposals and advances that he has put forward in his report. As a French Member of the European Parliament, and in view of the geographical position of France as a real crossroads in the European road network, I fully support all the initiatives aimed at reducing congestion on our roads, at promoting ways of transporting goods and persons other than by road and at improving the environmental performance of the transport system in general. I am also delighted at the position given to motorways of the sea in the Marco Polo II programme, as the development of these motorways will have a positive influence on reducing international road freight. As the rapporteur stressed, if nothing is done to reduce congestion on the roads, goods transport by road will increase overall by more than 60% by 2013. We will be faced with an increasing number of accidents, with greater congestion, with more environmental damage and, ultimately, with higher costs for European industry as a whole, which, to the extent that it depends on reliable and profitable supply chains, will become less competitive. That is why we must focus all of our efforts on developing intermodal transport. With the enlargement to the East, Europe's maritime borders have been pushed back, and we now have new conditions and opportunities for developing the motorways of the sea. We must make the most of them.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for January 2007, could be postponed due to the corruption that the Commission would have us believe is rife in those two countries. Such concern is altogether commendable. Before they start preaching, however, ought not some of our governments, including the one in France, to first put their own houses in order? Romania and Bulgaria are authentic European nations and are all the more worthy for having been subjected to the Turkish occupation between the 16th and 19th centuries, and then Communism from 1945 to 1990. That is why we are putting them on their guard against another form of oppression, which is less brutal but just as dangerous: the Europe of Brussels, which has no borders, destroys our national freedoms and identities and opens its gates to Islamic Turkey by denying the Christian origins of our civilisation. Since the vote cast by the people of France and of the Netherlands in 2005, that version of Europe no longer has any democratic legitimacy. It is time that all the European nations came together to build another Europe, the Europe of nations.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like straightaway to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and his proposals. It is a question in this instance of swiftly implementing a European emergency call system that provides a precise indication of where the accident took place and that alerts the nearest emergency services. I believe that the main function of this ‘eCall’ system must and will be to save lives. If there is, in fact, one area in which emergency assistance is to be considered vital for the survival and the treatment of the seriously injured, it is indeed that of the roads. In this connection, I should like to draw your attention to a specific aspect of road accidents: accidents caused by, or involving, heavy goods vehicles. In 2003, of the 90 220 accidents recorded in France that caused the deaths of 5 731 people, 4 472 accidents involved heavy goods vehicles, resulting in the deaths of 720 road users, 107 of whom were drivers of heavy goods vehicles. With a 16.10% fatal accident rate, the seriousness of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles is two and a half times higher than that recorded for accidents as a whole. As the real crossroads of Europe's road network, France, together with its European partners, must think as soon as possible about implementing alternative solutions to road traffic, which today carries the greatest danger and produces the most pollution. In order to increase safety for road users, we must not only create emergency response systems such as the one proposed today, but also free up the roads by shifting road traffic to the sea and the railways, without forgetting the waterways. It is by combining all of these efforts, and not by limiting ourselves to systematic police clampdowns only on motorists, that we will succeed in significantly reducing the number of deaths on our roads.

Mr Ferber’s report on the 2004 discharge of the European Parliament is fundamentally dishonest. Taking advantage of the new anti-Strasbourg offensive launched by the Anglo-Saxon lobby, Mr Ferber is going beyond his role of rapporteur in order slyly to set himself up as Strasbourg's critic. No, the European Parliament cannot decide on the location in which it will be based. That is a unanimous decision taken by the Heads of State or Government, which has been enshrined in the European Treaties since the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999. No, neither Strasbourg nor France are prepared to agree to give up what they have for some uncertain alternative, that is, to agree to the European Parliament’s being transferred to Brussels in exchange for a European Institute of Technology. Why not have a European centre of gerontology? Just as some people want to make France and the Netherlands vote again on the defunct European Constitution, others indulge in wishful thinking and want to do away with the European Parliament’s base in Strasbourg in flagrant breach of the Treaties. We will resolutely oppose that, not only on behalf of France, but also on behalf of the general interest of Europe.

Mr President, the Council and the Commission have taken note of the vote on the Gebhardt report on the Services Directive, and we can only be pleased about that. For once we are in the majority, and we shall make the most of it. We largely helped to take out the most questionable aspects of the Services Directive, starting with the notorious country of origin principle. Nonetheless, a number of grey areas remain, particularly in relation to services of general economic interest, and it will be up to the Council to resolve them, in agreement with Parliament. For the time being, the danger is elsewhere. The Commission intends to revise, and make more liberal, the directive on the posting of workers, which could partially invalidate the European Parliament’s legislative function. Finally, we condemn in the strongest terms the Commission’s decision to reprimand France on the grounds that it adopted decrees against hostile takeover bids in 11 sensitive and strategic sectors, particularly in relation to defence. The Commission prefers to go against its own camp rather than to defend Europe’s interests at the WTO or in world markets. It is therefore up to the Member States to correct this institutional and political anomaly.

The Services Directive - or notorious Bolkestein Directive – is a device for creating unemployment. The French referendum on the European Constitution had enabled the people of France to learn all about the directive’s ultraliberal and job-destroying philosophy. Despite a few cosmetic changes, its content today remains unchanged. The concept of the country of origin has been erased, but that does not mean that the concept of the freedom to provide services has disappeared. This whole matter is nothing other than a huge farce designed to push through what the liberals, the conservatives and the Left – all as zealously pro-European as each other – have been cleverly concocting with their respective national governments for nearly two years. Whether it is a question of the Bolkestein Directive, the Services Directive or the Gebhardt report, all of these texts that form the subject of controversies and of compromises extracted in extremis 
by the political groups of the European Parliament are the same and should be forcefully rejected. We are resolutely opposed to this ultraliberal and anti-national vision of the internal market in services, the only aim of which is ultimately to destroy our craft industry and our small French businesses under the guise of ‘free and undistorted competition’.

Just this once, we can be pleased with this text for several reasons. The introduction of a common air traffic controller licence cannot fail to make a great contribution to the objective of safety that we all want to see for this sector, a sector in which we have unfortunately seen too many examples of tragic aviation incidents. To this end, I am also pleased that the supplementary system of black lists of airlines considered to be dangerous has been established and can be applied to all of the States of the European Union. Furthermore, I believe that it should be noted that Europe is moving in the right direction in terms of the harmonisation of the professional training and competences of air traffic controllers. They are not in fact being harmonised downwards; quite the opposite. With regard to the conditions for entry into the profession, the qualifications required and the content of initial training, relatively high social, technical, linguistic and professional standards are provided for. This is particularly essential since, all too often unfortunately, air traffic controllers have to manage extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of an aircraft or an air crisis. We must therefore protect this profession, because the safety of the passengers of an entire sector depends on it.

 Small and medium-sized enterprises play a vital role in competition and innovation, in vocational training and even in spatial planning. They create jobs and wealth. This is all the more remarkable when you consider that they are often collapsing under fiscal, social and regulatory burdens that are as much as they can bear; that they have to face unrestricted global competition without the weapons of the big companies to defend themselves; that they find it more difficult to access capital, which is so vital to investment; and that a change of ownership often threatens their very existence. Could the solution come from Brussels? I doubt it. Europe's policies have never really taken account of the interests and characteristics of SMEs, even though they make up 99% of businesses. Aid and Community programmes are mainly accessible to firms with specialised departments to deal with them. European legislation is staggeringly complex, and the standards imposed are expensive to implement. The policy of opening up the market to unbridled and unfair global competition only adds to the problem. It is true that free enterprise creates wealth and employment, and it is true that we need to promote it. But if the European Union is to play a part in this, it cannot continue to be a technocracy that is more committed to European ideology than to the interests of Europeans.

 If there is one subject that awakens passions within the European institutions and provokes reactions in the Member States, it is the liberalisation of port services. In 2003, the European Commission achieved the feat of getting thousands of basically French, British, German, Belgian and Dutch dockworkers onto the streets in order to demonstrate, sometimes violently, against a draft directive that would jeopardise their status and lead inevitably to large job losses in their profession. Indeed, the most controversial aspect was that of self-handling, that is to say the opportunity for a shipowner, using his own staff and equipment, to take care himself of certain port services that, until now, had been the preserve only of dockworkers. The document proposed to us today has not abandoned the principle of self-handling, thereby leaving the door wide open for anyone to engage in the activities of dock work, pilotage, towage and mooring and for unscrupulous shipowners operating coffin ships to use under-qualified and underpaid staff. Whatever the objective pursued, Europe must not be constructed in a way that is to the detriment of safety standards and standards of professional qualification. From the comfort of their ivory tower, our European leaders are, once again, going to have to try and come up with something better, or else shelve their proposal.

 Trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of children are increasingly forming a sizeable parallel economy in Europe. According to the United Nations, nearly 4 million women and children are being abused or sexually assaulted. Inevitably, we are also seeing the methods of trafficking in human beings becoming more diversified. The growth in sex tourism and in demand for children for economic exploitation (as beggars, pickpockets, dealers, moonlighters, and so forth.), are all forms of crime and exploitation which in most cases are in the hands of organised criminal gangs. The dangerous Schengen Agreements, which abolished all controls at the European Union’s borders, allow them to be used as drug smugglers or robbers. Moreover, because they are minors, they cannot be prosecuted if they are arrested by the authorities. If we want to prevent all forms of human trafficking, we must tackle these mafias, these illegal trades that are constantly growing in a Europe that is wide open. Additional Community programmes and pious hopes from the many NGOs will achieve nothing. Only if people and our elites wake up to the ultraliberal pro-immigration policy being pursued by Brussels can we hope to eventually feel safe in Europe.

The proposed procedure reveals some significant legal shortcomings. The procedure takes place in two stages: 1.	Firstly, after a request has been made, the judge issues a European payment notification to be served on the debtor, who has three weeks in which to submit a statement of defence. 2.	Secondly, in the absence of a statement of defence, a European order for payment is delivered. According to the authors, this two-pronged approach is justified by the potential risk involved in issuing an irreversible claim at the outset. In aiming to simplify the procedure and to safeguard the debtor’s rights, it would therefore seem wiser to keep just the one stage, that is to say to provide for the delivery of the European order for payment at the outset and to make it enforceable. In return: - the time limit for lodging a statement of opposition must be extended; - and this time limit must only begin when the debtor has actually received the notification. That is why we reject Amendment 12, which allows a defendant to be sentenced without his or her being able to know the decision. Finally, the choice proposed in Amendment 20 between the notice being served by a bailiff or being delivered by post should not exist. The notice must be served by a bailiff, given the flaws in the postal systems in certain countries, such as France.

Mr President, this report, which concludes that the immunity of our colleague, Mr Gollnisch, should not be upheld, disregarded all of the general principles related to privileges and immunity, as well as the settled case-law of the competent committees. The report also engaged in an out-and-out witch hunt, thus conveying the position of the French judicial and political authorities, because there was no reason at all why Mr Gollnisch should not have made the remarks he did about the Second World War at the press conference held after the summer recess. They were improperly and scandalously taken out of context. If these same remarks had, in actual fact, been made by someone else, they would not have provoked an outcry; they would not even have been revisited. Proof of this was recently provided by Mr Chirac, the French Head of State.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the report on the request for defence of immunity and privileges of my colleague, Mr Gollnisch, will be debated shortly, I take the liberty of bringing up a particularly topical point. Last week, the French Prime Minister, Mr de Villepin, stated with strength and conviction that it was not up to the legislator to establish historical truth. He said that there was no official history in France. A few days later, the Head of State, Mr Chirac, made similar remarks by saying: ‘In the Republic, there is no official history. It is not up to the law to write history; that is a matter for historians’. What, then, are the French political and judicial authorities accusing Mr Gollnisch of? Of having said exactly the same thing a few months beforehand, namely that it was up to historians to study the issues relating to the Second World War, whatever the views of some of my French fellow Members, who set themselves up as the thought police, going so far as to exert unacceptable political pressure so that Mr Gollnisch’s request for defence of immunity will be rejected. In these conditions, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you not to plumb the depths of absurdity by adopting this report.

Mr President, I am pleased with the report by Mrs de Veyrac, which has the great merit of clearly proposing the principle of adopting a blacklist of unsafe, even dangerous, airlines. In view of recent repeated disasters resulting from the defectiveness of certain aircraft, it is essential that we act to identify them and ban them from flying. It is essential to the safety of all air passengers that they be aware of the identity of the airline carrying them and, furthermore, to know whether or not that airline is considered to be dangerous. This is an absolute right. This must be respected fully since it involves the lives of millions of people travelling across the world by air. I would like to express one reservation, however. What will be the scope of the Community list of these airlines not meeting European safety criteria? For the time being, it appears that the Commission has not set any common criteria for the establishment of a Community list. Do you fear the diplomatic consequences in relation to certain sensitive countries? Is there fear, for example, of the reaction of the Turkish authorities to the recent flight ban of Onur Air only by the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland? Why are the other European countries not associated with this prohibition measure? The text that has been presented to us proposes, amongst other things, increasing the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency. Why not, if the objective is the strengthening of common criteria for inspection, prohibition and restriction of flying rights? Nevertheless, is there provision for measures to control this Agency and means for appealing against its decisions? We must legislate, of course, and quickly, but we must take care not to remove any of the Member States’ room for manoeuvre in such a crucial area as the safety of their citizens.

This report on managing economic migration is a web of lies, falsehoods and ideological bias. The wording is so excessive as to do a disservice to immigrants themselves by aiming systematically to encourage a policy of immersion at European level. No national government whatsoever could present such a catalogue of measures without being sent to the opposition benches at the next election. Mrs Klamt wants to go through European channels by keeping the people in the dark about the crime being committed behind their backs. Fortunately, the Council, in its great wisdom, has held on to the principle of unanimity for all issues to do with legal immigration. Only one example is needed to highlight the absurd nature of such proposals: ‘economic immigration can help in the management of existing migratory flows… and immigration has been proven to have positive effects on the labour market’. This is obviously a falsehood: the more we let in legal immigrants, the more we will see an explosion in the number of illegal immigrants, who are hoping to have their status regularised one day in the near future, as in Spain and in Italy. The European Parliament would be making a fool of itself and discrediting itself if it were to adopt such a report, which, if adopted, would draw to our borders millions of men and women enticed by the land of opportunity promised by our sorcerer’s apprentices.

On many occasions, we have stressed the fact that Turkey is not a European country, whether by virtue of its geography, its history, its culture, its language or its religion. Faced with such evidence that is borne out by the Treaties, one cannot but conclude that the leaders of Europe are blind. Only the people of Europe, instilled with the common sense absent in their leaders, have understood for a long time that Turkey’s joining Europe would mean an end to the European adventure and, above all, would entail the rapid spread of Islam in European society. The Turkish people, who are themselves being provocative, refuse to recognise the Republic of Cyprus on the grounds that they occupy part of it. They do so in defiance of international law. This is without mentioning the Armenian genocide of 1915. The duty to remember, which our great Western consciences hold so dear, has not reached as far as them. In their new penal code, making reference to this very Armenian genocide or to the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus is punishable by imprisonment. In these conditions, and without even mentioning the tragic fate of the Christian minorities, it is obscene to open accession negotiations on 3 October with a large country in Asia Minor.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that China, because of its influence over North Korea, holds the keys to peace in that region of the world. However, the increasingly aggressive attitude of Communist China towards Taiwan constitutes a threat to this peace that is all the more serious because the leaders in Beijing have nuclear weapons. Ever since 1949, those leaders have never given up hope of annexing Taiwan, which has, thanks to the courage of its inhabitants, become one of the most dynamic economies in the Pacific and a model of democracy in a region where there are still many totalitarian regimes. This aggression will not be appeased by the shady deals in which some European leaders are indulging, foremost among them being Mr Chirac, who has gone as far as inviting the Chinese Communist dictator to his chateau. Only a firm, decisive attitude will bring the authorities in Beijing to make compromises and, in particular, to recognise the right of the Taiwanese to self-determination. Until they do so, the Member States of the European Union must maintain the embargo on exporting arms to Communist China. Were our governments to adopt a different policy, not only would they be betraying the values of freedom and democracy that they are always so proud of affirming, but they would also be seriously compromising the stability of the Far East.

The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have put the issue of transport security at the top of the political agenda. As vital links in the transport chain connecting the flow of goods and passengers by sea and by land, ports must obviously be the subject of security measures, in line with proposals by the Commission. I can but endorse such an initiative because, as the elected European representative of the large north-west region, more than 15 large maritime trade ports vital to the local and national economy are affected. France is susceptible to this dossier as it has three particularly well-exposed coastlines. The English Channel in the north (the ports of Le Havre, Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne and Rouen), the Atlantic coast (the ports of Bordeaux, Nantes, Saint-Nazaire and La Rochelle which form entry ports for trade with Eastern, Southern and Northern Europe), and finally, the Mediterranean coast (the Marseille-Fos port). These security measures must obviously not be restricted to port terminals alone, but must also extend to the whole of the port and related activities.

 Every year, the European Parliament’s report on Human Rights tells the world how to respect these rights. However, it does not mention the situation in Member States of the European Union. I wish to draw attention to the case of Marek Dochnal and Krzysztof Maciej Popenda, two Polish businessmen, who have been in captivity since October 2004. The charges against them have been changed several times, extending with no real legal basis the prosecution procedures which allow them to be detained. This is a violation of Article 6(2) of the ECHR on presumption of innocence. Their identities and photographs have been published, in contravention of Polish law, to try to put pressure on the judges. Information about their private and family lives, not connected with the legal investigation, has been also published, which breaches Article 8 of the ECHR. These two men are victims of political persecution. Perhaps this persecution aims to refute the testimony of Mr Dochnal in front of the parliamentary committee investigating any links between certain Polish politicians and certain oil companies. I hope and trust that this Parliament will react against this abuse.

 Levelling downwards – that is the technique constantly used by Brussels to harmonise European and non-European legislation. In this case it is the certificates issued to seafarers. The recognition of certificates issued ‘outside the European Union’ is simpler than the scheme in force within the EU. That inevitably leads to the recruiting of more seafarers outside Europe than in it. This report recommends that our recognition procedures be simplified, but not that existing procedures outside the EU be brought up to the same standard, which would have had the advantage of limiting the numerous cases of fraud which occur. We must not sell off our seafarers’ diplomas and qualifications on the cheap. Their occupations are difficult, and the constraints attached to them – low wages, long voyages, restrictive working conditions – certainly do not encourage young people’s interest in training for them. This is a market in which there is a growing shortage of qualified workers, and that works to the advantage of a cheap and under-qualified labour force from the countries of Asia and elsewhere in the East. We must restore the career ladder, and attach importance to diplomas and qualification certificates, not the contrary. Finally, we must abolish flags of convenience on the rust buckets which swarm over and pollute our seas and oceans.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have chocolate without cocoa and a ban on cheese made with milk straight from the cow. Our Roquefort was subject to 300% customs duties and we nearly had chickens washed in bleach and even a lactation hormone, somatotropin. Now we are considering the idea of colouring white wine with red wine to make rosé wine. If you will permit me, as we say in France, this has been the drop of water that has made the vase overflow, with this water having also been authorised for blending wine, just like the ‘woodwork’ wines made with wood chips rather than in barrels were previously authorised, and the wines made with imported musts were nearly authorised. Wine could even be made in Thailand. The problem is the psychoanalytic reaction that this idea produces, as this is an attack on culture. What is the definition of wine? If it is an industrial product, then it can be blended, like a wine Coca-Cola. However, if it is an agricultural food product, then you cannot touch it, otherwise you cause a cultural shock. ‘This is my blood; drink it in remembrance of me’. If you blend blood, then you make contaminated blood. Can you understand this disproportionate reaction? With this rosé idea, you have questioned 2 500 years of heritage dating from the Roman empire, which had to tackle the barbarians. Madam President, this is what I wanted to say: ‘It is a Freudian matter, not a wine-growing matter’.

Mr President, thank you for Sète. There are indeed fisheries resources, and a new monitoring system, which we are debating this evening, but above all there are fishermen, their jobs and their livelihoods, and being a fisherman is the hardest job in the world. It is not that of an official or elected representative, and it shapes men who are free, but desperate today, hence the uprisings of the tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean, in Sète, in Le Grau-du-Roi, and the irate fishermen in Boulogne, in France. We have regulated their fishing since 1983, so for 26 years. However, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Rome, Articles 32 to 39 on the CAP have also related to them, and the very first Community regulation on fishing came into force in 1970. For 39 years we have been legislating: on the shock of the arrival of Spain in 1986, and of Denmark in 1993, on gillnets, driftnets, fishery agents, total allowable catches, quotas, aid, fleet restructuring, and modernisation. We legislate on sanctions, biological rest periods, stocks, discards, monitoring systems, humans, species, cod, hake, bluefin tuna, and even international agreements, and now, on recreational fishing! What is more, it is still not working. Blue Europe is becoming greyer and greyer. Why? Because fishing is part of the 21st-century global food challenge; it is at global level that it will have to be managed. Like the financial crisis, pandemics, climate change, immigration and serious crime, fish are alter-globalists. They respect neither borders nor Community law. Europe is too small to regulate fisheries resources, and, from Peru to Japan, Moscow to Dakar, Ireland and Valencia, we are going to need regulations on the global shared ownership of fisheries resources. That is the path, Mr President, that Brussels must also take.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Lisbon Strategy is a great success in one area at least: the European Union has become one of the most competitive regions in the world where poverty creation is concerned. We have thus been able to create 80 million poor people and 43 million starving Europeans, a figure that includes the elderly, who may die quicker and reduce public spending as a result, meaning that the Maastricht criteria can be met more effectively. In France alone, 80 million meals are served each year by the charitable organisation Restos du Cœur
. In order to feed the poor since 1987, we have had a food distribution programme with an annual budget of EUR 300 million. EUR 300 million divided by 80, divided by 12, comes to 25 cents of food distributed each month to each of the 80 million poor. This food was taken from the intervention stocks, but, since the 1992 reform, where the mountains of butter, the rivers of milk and the bulging refrigerators came up for criticism, these stocks have been used up. For 2010-2012, we shall be buying foodstuffs on the market, where non-European goods also appear, for the sake of the WTO and the fight against protectionism. This means that, since 1962, we have been feeding our herds of cattle imported oilseeds and, from 2010, we shall be feeding our poor imports, too. And all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality. The problem, however, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen – the real problem – is that there are still 80 million poor people after 22 years of having a food programme.

Mr President, we are all infuriated at the level of food prices and the way they are structured. Products start at a value of 1 in farms, rise to 6 in supermarkets, and sole starts at a value of 1 in Africa and rises to 14 in French shops, with the result that at 8 p.m. … the supermarkets close and Europeans rummage through bins. However, in the face of this situation which, at the two ends of the chain, does not make farmers rich but does make it difficult for consumers to put food on the table, it is not enough to call for transparency or denounce the distribution oligopolies. There is speculation in Geneva on the price of rice, there is speculation in Chicago on the price of maize, there is major financial crime, and there is an International Criminal Court. Well, at the G20, the International Criminal Court’s powers should be extended to cover major financial crime, and speculating on food is a major crime that is on a par with that perpetrated by Bashir in Darfur. That is the real signal that must be sent out.

Mr President, it is fine to have a strategic partnership to begin with, to have the Volkswagen factory in Puebla and to have joint parliamentary committees with Chile and with Mexico, but it has been 30 years, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra said in his report, of being realistic, of cooperating, of setting a climate, a little discussion on agriculture, drugs, women, water and so on. We have to go further. More ambition is needed, both for Europe and for Latin America. We have to set a target: for example, 2025. In a generation, in the next 20 years, we must create an alliance of civilisations between Europe and Latin America, and why not even integration! To do this, there is the EuroLat framework, the parliament which brings together Europe and Latin America. In this framework, a manifesto is needed, a resolution which will be the equivalent of what 8 May 1950 meant for Europe. Let us pool our peoples, our resources, our intelligence, old and young from both sides and create, without delay, an area of free movement for students, researchers, intellectuals and intelligence. That would mean an automatic cultural visa. Malinche needed no visa to go and teach Quechua or Mayan to Cortés. It is the first step on the road to creating a block with a billion Latin Americans, a billion Christians in the match of nations. I know full well that this may appear unrealistic to the economic realists, but if the dream you are chasing is not big enough, you are going to lose sight of it even as you chase it.

Madam President, one can cite as examples of major international financial crime the Madoff affair, obviously, but also the speculation in agricultural raw materials that took place in 2007. This is why a whole host of legal experts, including Carlos Sotelo’s practice in Spain, and networks of large practices, have proposed the creation of an international financial court. We could, moreover, just extend the International Criminal Court’s remit to cover major financial crime because, in 2007, millions of children died as a result of the speculation in agricultural products. There was a financial Darfur. This international financial court would have the power to investigate speculation and speculators, to inspect tax havens, to regulate and to punish offenders. This is the test of sincerity for Barack Obama, for President Sarkozy and for the other leaders. This is the political message to send out to the general public, and this would be the first stage of a global organisation, a global phenomenon and a global cure for a global economic crisis.

Mr President, what is good about animals is that the years go by and the problems remain the same. For example, we always mention jaw traps when talking about wild animals, and the question of transport, breeding and feed always arises in relation to farm animals. Animal feed is a classic case; it is a mishmash, a load of rubbish. Antibiotics, clenbuterol, growth hormones, even the remains of other animals, are used, and this is what the United Kingdom’s contaminated feed problem from the 1990s was all about. However, today we are told that the junk-food era is over. There has been a 2002 directive and a 2005 Court of Justice ruling and, now, there is the desire to reconcile the market and profit – which is referred to as intellectual property – with consumer safety. Thus, here we find ourselves today armed with a regulation. Using the classic tool of labelling, all the components are going to be indicated, in descending order of weight, and there will also be an open declaration, an Annex III and a tolerance of +/-15%. Moreover, the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition. Only two big questions remain. The first concerns imported animals which have not been labelled. Mr Parish is here; he has taken a great interest in animals arriving from Brazil, which are not marked and which have been fed clenbuterol. When it comes to the safety of these animals, we do not know a great deal. And then there remains the big question of imported feed, namely raw materials that have been arriving from the American continent since the 1960s. In the 1960s, this came in the form of corn gluten feed – molasses, oilseed residues – and, today, it is in the form of transgenic soya from Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and transgenic maize from Canada and the United States. And this, dare I say it, because people are against local GMOs, but not immigrant GMOs. The fact is, we are talking here about two-thirds of the feed of our herds, and that is a real health issue. The single issue of European health security is obscuring the wider issue of global health risks, due to the Uruguay Round agreement and the Blair House agreement, which oblige us to import our oilseeds to feed two-thirds of our herds.

 Madam President, Mrs Vassiliou, the storm called ‘Klaus’ in German, or ‘Nicolas’ in French, has devastated eight ‘départements’ in my south-west France constituency, and Landes in particular, hence the main impact being on the forest. The equivalent of six years’ harvest of timber is lying on the ground, that is, 50 million cubic metres of windfall or windbreak over 300 000 hectares. The first thing to do is clear the forest to prevent the timber rotting. There needs to be payment of EUR 5-10 per cubic metre of timber removed, that is, in the region of EUR 500 million, namely the amount of aid France has given to the press. Afterwards, the forest will need to be reseeded and replanted, leaving a 20-year hiatus in the timber industry. Now, this industry ranges from the woodcutters and cafés where they have a drink, to hauliers, nursery gardeners, vendors and so on. The second industry affected is that of poultry, sheep and cattle farming. Roofs have been ripped off, animals lost and feed stores destroyed. We can see a need for a European agricultural insurance fund against climate and health risks. The French Presidency talked about this, and the Czech Presidency should do likewise. The third set of victims is silent, since these victims are never mentioned: the elderly and the isolated in villages in France which are still without electricity. We need to create a European ‘Fourth Age-Climate’ strategy, like the ‘Climate-Energy’ one, that is to say, we must tackle the impact of the climate on the millions of people aged over 80 or 85. We have to create a modern fourth-age economy in order to emerge from the crisis and avoid the geriatric European Rwanda we are heading for, an economy with a modern construction industry, pharmaceutical and medical research, and a new network to avoid Europe having Gabon-style healthcare. Above all, we must prevent these climatic incidents providing an opportunity to play at Darwin and natural selection, while we should be building a Europe for life.

Mr President, I am pleased that it is a Briton, Mr Parish, who has tabled this text. It just goes to show you that two thousand years ago, those Roman soldiers did the right thing in going to Great Britain with their amphora of olive oil and wine. Well then, two consequences inevitably flow from this. That it is rather odd from a symbolic point of view to establish the Food Authority in Helsinki, and that it is unreasonable for the European Commission not to revisit the following issues: firstly, to re-establish aid for almond trees, then to stop the attacks on olive trees, particularly in Andalusia and throughout Europe; to stop the attacks on blue fin tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean and the attacks on the European vineyards where vines are being torn up. I, myself, would like to suggest to the Commissioner and Mr Barroso that they organise a huge banquet in Portugal and serve lamb’s milk cheese and Samos wine. (The President cut off the speaker)

 Madam President, the sustainable management of fishing means regulating fishing efforts, of course, but it should also take account of fishermen’s efforts. Fishing, as everyone agrees, and above all offshore fishing and deep-sea fishing, is the hardest job in the world, even if we are no longer in the era of the fishing conditions of the Basques and Icelanders of the 19th century, who embarked on long campaigns. It remains a very tough profession and worthy of respect, with 24 000 deaths every year. Fishing is the perfect example of global activity due to the globalisation of the resource, namely the fish, which have no regard for national borders; therefore international laws are the only appropriate response. Since fishermen’s work must be regulated internationally, the legislator is, of course, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and we are currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first ILO fishing conventions, on the minimum age, employment controls, medical examinations and accommodation. Today’s convention, Convention 188, will thus amend, supplement and revise the previous conventions. This must all be ratified as soon as possible, before 2012. It is a fine example of joint management of jointly owned global resources by joint parties, and it is urgent, since the sea professions – dockers, fishermen, sailors – in today’s globalised economic competition, are exposed to all manner of abuse, exploitation and trafficking, even cases of slavery, in the name of cutting costs, obviously. Legal protection is therefore vital in terms of health, accommodation, safety, working time, living conditions, salaries, medical care, and thus employment contracts and social security. Hence we are now establishing a minimum legal status for fishermen and in so doing we are creating a level playing field for global competition. This may not necessarily mean much to European fishermen who already have this, but for the fishermen of the world, of Peru, Asia or Africa, it is a great step forward.

 Madam President, at Christmas, little boys receive red cars to play at being firemen, and little girls receive Barbie dolls to play at everything else. Likewise, the Commission and the Council of Ministers have a small budget with which to play at public finances. We are playing, then, at having a tea party with the budget, dishing out a little for Galileo, a little for Kosovo, or a little for Palestine. There is even a little for fruit in schools. A financial and economic tsunami is sweeping across the automotive industry, across property, across services, and we are playing around with a budget of EUR 116 billion, which is the total of the Spanish budget for 42 million citizens, or rather 45 million, and we are dealing with 400 million citizens. I am not even going to mention the US budget of EUR 2 000 billion. A continent is about to go into recession and we are dividing up a few crumbs. We also continue to drone on about the rule of 1% of gross national income and deficits that must not exceed 3%. There are two lessons in all this. Firstly, when you cannot assess the price of a barrel of oil, falling from 100 to 40, while Goldman Sachs was predicting 200, and when you cannot make forecasts over a few months, how can you have a multiannual financial framework for seven years? That is a scientific absurdity. The second lesson is this: the entire history of the budget shows that legal ceilings, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act in the US, the rule of 1% of national income, are all, again, foolishness. Public finance is driven by empiricism, and not by dogmatism. We needed to have a budgetary energy plan to change the economic climate. That was called a large European loan. We needed to have the room to change things but, for that, we needed ambition.

For twenty-seven countries to have a European budget in the region of EUR 130 billion – that is to say, the equivalent of Spain’s budget, and that alone – is, under normal circumstances, already rather strange. Nevertheless, it is thus that, in a Europe that lacks high-speed rail links between Finland and Spain, and between France and Poland, as well as equipment and staff for the universities, research centres and retirement homes of a continent submerged by the geriatric tsunami, the worldwide crisis of interbank liquidity, of the real estate shock on several economies and of the decline in confidence of entrepreneurs and workers, a budget effort is required that is far removed from the usual European budget. We therefore require exceptional budget programming for a major infrastructure plan, approved via a major ‘European financial referendum’. By this I mean a European loan, of an amount equivalent to EUR 1 700 billion, raised by the banking sector.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the current financial crisis is proof that, when a problem is global, we need global action. This is particularly true in food and agriculture. This is largely why the World Trade Organisation was created, and we all agree on this. The WTO tries to have globalised rules. However, it seems that this does not function exactly as we would like, because we are faced with the following problem: we need to reconcile two things, the free trade that we all agree on, and protection, which is also necessary. Protecting our economies or national agriculture is not a byword for protectionism. To do this, the road that we have taken over the past 60 years, since GATT, has been a rocky one, with tariffs being cut with a view to scrapping them altogether. Technically, lowering customs tariffs seems to be difficult. As proof, look at the number of mathematical formulas that exist for this purpose: the South Korean formula, the European formula, and of course the Swiss formula. This does not really work, because a product is not unitary. It is composed of numerous elements with very different rules of origin, so technically, reducing customs tariffs is not as simple as we might think. Therefore, we find ourselves in a technical rut, and it is through negotiations that we are trying, politically, to find a way out of this rut. However, scientists have apparently invented a new customs technology: customs tariffs that are deductible for the exporter against the importing state’s economy. In concrete terms, this deductible customs tariff amounts to a customs credit equal to the amount of duty that the exporter has incurred in the importing country. There are three sides to this customs credit: it is refundable, negotiable and transferable. First of all, it is refundable: when the exporter goes to buy something from the importer, he can deduct the amount of duty paid. Secondly, it is negotiable, because if the exporting company, which has paid duty, has nothing to buy from the importer, it can sell its customs credit on the stock market or to a bank. Finally, it is transferable: to help developing countries, the importer can donate the surplus customs credit above the amount of customs duty. Well, with this technique, we create a trade currency, where the money supply is equal to the amount of existing customs tariffs. The European Union, for example, would provide EUR 13 billion in trade currency.

 Mr President, tropical timber tonight, the financial crisis this week, major pandemics, migration, the food crisis… it all leads us to the same conclusion: the major political issues of today are global and require a global political response. Of course, in principle no one is contesting the permanent sovereignty of Indonesia over its tropical forests and its right to plant palm trees to produce palm oil, just as Brazil has the right to replace its forest with cattle, just like Gabon. However, it appears that the exercise of territorial sovereignty has negative consequences outside the sovereign territory. Deforestation, poverty, the threatened extinction of fauna and flora and cheap timber all cause damage on a global scale. Therefore, it is not a question of saying, ‘people who harm others must make amends for the problems they cause.’ It is a question of addressing these issues at a legal level. How do we tackle this problem? Where do we start? In Europe, by labelling timber, certifying it as a sort of ‘fair-trade’ timber, in the same way as we do with fair-trade coffee, with bilateral trade agreements? No doubt this is an essential first step, but the solution must be global. We need much more than a multilateral agreement on timber because people in the Communities, because Africans, Latinos and Asians, are also entitled to be rewarded for the various functions that they perform. This is why, Mr President, we need to look at these problems politically, at a global level, and find concepts and models to enable life on our planet to continue.

 Madam President, there are already global accounting regulations, global food standards in the Codex Alimentarius, global tax standards and UN model double taxation conventions. Now we are going to get global standards for the labelling, classification, packaging and tonnage of chemical substances. The 2002 global legislation of the UN Social and Economic Council, the general harmonised system, is being transposed into Community law. There is certainly some value for everyone in global harmonisation – for consumers, users, SMEs – but beyond these 2 000 pages and procedures, annexes and lists, the regulation shows that European standardisation is not enough to deal with globalised problems. Global problems need global solutions, which means that the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, is right: between UN level and global level, the European level is increasingly out of date, obsolete and, ultimately, useless.

Mr President, the fisheries agreement between Europe and Mauritania, about which our fellow Member and friend Mrs Fraga Estévez has written a report, covers one of the richest regions of the world in terms of fish stocks. That is why, for example, in Dakhla, the former Spanish capital Villa Cisneros, in that part of Western Sahara now under Moroccan control, there is a 40 km sea inlet which is called the Rio de Oro, or Gold River, because of the reflection of sunlight on the scales of the shoals of fish. In the past, this abundance of fish has actually caused us problems with Morocco. Now we are having to tackle a similar problem, but one which concerns fishing in Mauritania from 2008 to 2012. This is an area where octopus and cephalopod stocks, for example, may decline, hence the biological recovery period, but where, conversely, it is essential to fish for sardines, since the sardine is a predator of the octopus. In practical terms, this means first of all distributing the fishing quotas, the licences, between five European countries, including Spain, obviously, and Italy, but also Portugal, Mr President, and there are some other vessels, freezer trawlers, perhaps from the Baltic States. After that, it is a matter of reducing catches from approximately 400 000 tons to 250 000 tonnes because, strangely enough, these quotas are not being used, and this also applies to Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, which is something, General Morillon, that our Mediterranean tuna fishermen can only dream about. In Mauritania, the average use of fishing opportunities ranges from 90% for crustaceans to a mere 22% for tuna. As in all these agreements and protocols, there is obviously a financial contribution which is paid for the right to fish, and which is round EUR 300-305 million over four years, at the rate of EUR 70 or 80 million a year. Mr Borg has told us how important this contribution is, since it represents approximately 15% of Mauritania’s annual budget. This operation is also advantageous for Mauritania because the contribution remains at more or less the same level whereas catches, by contrast, are declining. Nevertheless, the Mauritanians are causing a serious problem by their harassment of our vessels, and by the boardings which they carry out simply in order to collect fines along the way, although it is true that the European Commission, as Mrs Isler Béguin reminded us just now, has not been particularly sympathetic here, and is now putting pressure on the Mauritanian Government. Although fishing is obviously very important in these areas, on the Moroccan side, for example in Dakhla, the fish is exported to Brazil and provides a living for the entire town, hence the concern, on the part of the FAO and the ACP countries, to have a sustainable fishing industry and a code of good conduct. Mr President, perhaps in spite of the conduct of the European Commission, which has not always been very ‘good’ during these negotiations with the young democracy of Mauritania, we should nevertheless welcome this agreement, because it is perhaps one of the last that we shall obtain in this region, now that Morocco wants to preserve and resume control of its natural resources.

 Mr President, the food industry uses 300 food additives, 2 600 natural or artificial flavourings, plus traditional diastases or enzymes and also azo dyes. This is why our laws need to be harmonised. Since it concerns goose and duck liver, preserved truffles or snails, we can clearly understand why there are a dozen laws, plus the four regulations tabled for a common authorisation procedure with the list of products. Yes, these additives increase the risk of sometimes serious allergies, but perhaps the precautionary principle has been taken too far here. In 2008, a year when the global food crisis is rampant, when, Mr President, Italy is selling us dioxin-contaminated mozzarella, a business worth EUR 10 million, I find it hard to believe that the 15 million unemployed in Europe should be particularly worried by enzymes and flavourings, although it is typical of the European Union to concern itself with the infinitely small in an infinitely large world.

 Mr President, there is a single market, there is a single currency, so it would make complete sense for there to be a single group, which in any case would be much more efficient. There would be a single speaker and things would be shared more easily. Mr Corbett is proposing to raise the threshold to 30. This seems highly dangerous, because the Irish, the French and the Dutch are able to send 31 and this would cause us real problems. Personally I think that we need a floating threshold. It would remain at 30, but the President would be able to use his or her discretion to increase it to 35 or 40 if MEPs who want to join are not fully enrolled. During the Fourth Republic, a practice known as ‘unseating’ was used. At the start of the legislature, the majority would decide whether to renew the office of a particular Member of Parliament or to unseat him or her. This method is perfect. Mr Corbett could be in charge, for example, of unseating anyone who did not share his views. We could also adjust it: those who did not share Mr Corbett’s views would pay their salary to him or his group. Anyway, none of this matters; the Irish have proved that you can adopt whatever rules you want. It no longer works like that here, Mr Corbett.

 Mr President, with 10 million illegal immigrants in Europe and with a Boeing holding 300 passengers we would need to fill more than 30 000 Boeings in order to meet the provisions of the Directive on the return process. That means more than 1 000 Boeings taking off from each of the 27 European capitals over a period of three years. In terms of numbers this would clearly be a mad and surreal proposal. However, there is something even more insane. As immigration is in fact nothing more than the social reflection of economic globalisation, where world capitalism makes workers compete with each other, what we are doing is producing a Directive to deal with the reflection of a problem. I do not know if this is a case of hypocrisy or someone’s idea of a joke, but in any case it is certainly short-sighted. The nomads of the planet keep on the move because they want to eat and drink, look after themselves and educate themselves. Food and the shortage of it, water and the distribution of it, pandemics and the manner in which they spread are all now part of what the nations of the world have in common.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a serious subject, namely the gradual disappearance of Europe’s sheep and Europe’s shepherds. There are a billion sheep in the world, but Europe only has 97 million, in other words less than 10%, and when it comes to ewes the situation is even worse, for there are now only 67 million of them in Europe. Admittedly the UK may create an illusion with its 15 million head of sheep and Spain too with its 16 million, while Chairman Parish’s Ireland is self-sufficient to the tune of 333%. France, however, has seen its flocks decline from nearly 13 million animals some 25 years ago to about 8 million today and this will decrease further to a mere 5 million by 2015. In France one out of every two legs of lamb consumed is sourced abroad. Even worse than that it is the lactating ewes that are disappearing. Of course the causes are well known: massive increase in the cost of feed, reduced consumption levels, the difficult life of the sheep farmer, catarrhal fever, falling prices, decoupling of aid and, above all, duty-free imports of mutton and lamb from New Zealand. Some 227 000 tonnes arrive from New Zealand every year, i.e. twice the French production level. It is not a case of wolves eating sheep; it is a case of New Zealand sheep eating European ones. A century and a half ago New Zealand had 1 million head of sheep; today it has 40 million. Over the same period the French figure has fallen from 30 million to 8 million. So what can we do? We need a major European plan for the sheep and lamb industry, the willingness to pay a subsidy of EUR 15 for each lactating ewe and a sheep subsidy that is 125% of the cattle subsidy, loans to help modernise livestock buildings, conveniently located abattoirs, a European risk-insurance fund for livestock farmers, an assistance scheme and, why not Erasmus grants so that young shepherds can go to learn their trade in Spain or Italy. Thank you, Mr President. If we have sheep we have civilisation.

 Madam President, Evo Morales wrote to us about the directive on immigration that in France is known as ‘sans-papiers’. A Latin American head of state writing to Europe is not really a foreigner, it is like a cousin writing. Obviously, we are States with rules that must be respected; otherwise disorder ensues and in the end everyone suffers. However, since there is immigration from Peru to Chile, from Nicaragua to Costa Rica and from Mozambique to South Africa, immigration is global with global causes. In a globalised economic market, immigration is the supreme stage of capitalist logic, where the person who has nothing to sell can sell only himself. It may be necessary to have a ramshackle continental European legal structure for the effects of global migration, but immigration will eventually have to be dealt with on a global level, as is the case for food, pandemics and basic education, because it is already globalised. That is known as ‘regulating’ the shared areas of global co-ownership.

Madam President, Commissioner, the Mediterranean is the region of all divisions: geographical divisions, historical divisions – in Salamin, Axion, Lepanto – demographic divisions and even philosophical divisions, between magical thinking and logical thinking, in other words the Orient and the Occident, but also the East and West, from the Egypt of Moses, then Jesus, then Mohammed, from Omar Khayyam to Baudelaire, from the plateaus of Syria to the plains of Languedoc. The Mediterranean is the hope of three monotheistic religions and the civilisation of wheat and wine, not of sauerkraut and beer or mussels in Chez Léon. The Union for the Mediterranean is not just a matter of de-pollution or civil security. What you need for that is the fire brigade! The Mediterranean is not managed by 44 senior officials in Brussels, capital of the Mediterranean. Why not also have an Erasmus grant so that Plato and Aristotle can come and study Community law in the Bruges College? The Mediterranean manages the affairs of the women and men of the Mediterranean: in other words prosperity, for example, of fishermen, who are asking you for it at the moment; in other words peace in the West, in the Saharan provinces of Morocco, and in the East, in Palestine. Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, our dreams need to be big enough for us not to lose sight of them when pursuing them, and that is why there is not a restricted union of the people of the Mediterranean.

Fishermen in France, Spain and Italy are telling us of their legitimate revolt, their right to make a living, their indignation. Small farmers are saying the same. For a year the price of fuel has been stifling our fishermen economically. This comes on top of the bureaucratic stifling they are experiencing as a result of the quotas, penalties, monitoring and inspections that are transforming the freedom of the high seas into a liquid Soviet Union. In the light of the tragedy affecting this profession, what are we proposing to these men, these regions, these villages, these local economies? Nothing! Except vague transitional aid, like palliative care. What is worse, on the day that the Mediterranean fishermen are in Brussels to demand their right to live, here we are discussing additional criminal penalties to combat illegal fishing. Fishermen are even refused support in terms of VAT and excise duty. The solution is a European debt compensation fund for fishermen to ensure that they do not have to put up with the inequality in relation to public burdens, generated by the import policy and the domination of the distribution giants.

 Madam President, Commissioner, it is like customs night here tonight, with Mr Markov’s report on the GSP and Mr Audy’s report on non-tariff barriers, in other words these import and export rules and procedures which we call administrative protectionism, or self-righteous customs barriers. Although the WTO talks a great deal about reducing GATT tariffs, we also have subtle protectionism in the form of quotas, peak tariffs – Europe has more than 110 peak tariffs; Canada, admittedly, has 430 – and graduated import duties that prevent small countries from becoming industrialised, not to mention a list of sensitive products and a GSP which is conditional on respect for human rights and the subjective state of play of customs rules of origin, value or tariff lines. Europe has more than 5 000 tariff lines. In agriculture alone, we have 2 726 tariff lines. Japan, admittedly, has 1 890 and the USA has 1 779, so what do we do with goods when it comes to tariff lines? For example, how do we classify a mummy that arrives here from Egypt for an exhibition? We classify it as dried fish! Mr Audy’s report covers all of these problems and recognises that the US has returned to customs McCarthyism with a security/insecurity witch-hunt. The era of the pacifist approach of Pope John Paul II, with his famous 1978 homily (‘Open the borders of states, political and economic systems, wide expanses of civilisations and cultures to His grace. Do not be afraid!’), is over, hence the Doha Round, which is still ongoing 10 years after it was started, whereas the Uruguay Round, if I may be so bold as to say, only took 8 years. What is the root of this problem? The problem stems from the fact that customs duties are 2 000 years old and date back to ancient Rome, to Rome tolls. However, this is the 21st century, and as such, Commissioner, we need new customs technology. Fortunately this new customs technology has been invented by scientists and involves deductible customs duties that can be adapted according to the production cost differential, that are refundable, that can be traded on an exchange and that can be modified to help developing countries. This, Commissioner, is what you should lay on the WTO negotiating table – this new customs technology – so that we can abolish our archaic customs system.

It was said that there were milk lakes, butter mountains and fridges crammed with meat. Then Brussels invented some Malthusian recipes to clear production. There were the MGQs, set-aside, slaughter premiums and quotas … for milk. Thousands of dairy cow breeders disappeared. New Zealand lorded it over the milk market. Then things changed. There were milk shortages. Prices soared. Brussels finally realised the folly of its policy to stifle production. Thus we decide to raise the quotas by 2%. This, it should be said, is also done for a ‘soft landing’ because quotas will be abolished in 2015 and the market handed over to integral liberalism, with the consequent risks for our stockbreeders in the mountains. Thus we ruined stockbreeders in the 1980s and prevented young people from entering the market, since it was not possible to ‘buy’ the operator’s ‘licence’, which was the quota. Now we are heading for increased desertification in mountainous agricultural areas if there are no longer any quotas to roll out as a safety net.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Goepel, in Berlin – nearly 10 years ago now – Chancellor Schmidt and the French President Jacques Chirac decided to grant a reprieve to farmers until 2013. With the end of milk quotas, the end of a proper agricultural budget as part of the 2014-2019 financial framework, and the retirement of the majority of producers, not to be replaced, the end of the great CAP was planned for 2013 – it was as simple as that. Today you are questioning this agreement, and in the name of the ‘CAP Health Check’ you are accelerating the march towards the elimination of agriculture within the first pillar. This is nothing new! By dint of quotas, MGQs, Herod premiums, set-aside, decoupling and grubbing up, MacSharry, Steichen, Fischler had practised this strategy of leaving the monopoly on food production to the southern hemisphere and the Pacific countries for 30 years. Today, in the gripping technical debates on full decoupling, modulation – whether degressive or progressive – eco-conditionality, rural development, and reference values – whether historical or non-historical – simply hide the only real issue, as China and India are about to launch a call for bids to feed the planet, as the morning comes for farmers when there is a rise in prices and demand. Does Europe still want to be one of the world’s great farms, together with Brazil? Yes or no? (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, most of our States have lines of credit in their budgetary law for dealing with disasters. Under French budgetary law, for example, there are global allocations that allow appropriations to be committed by decree in advance in emergencies. Since November 2002, European budgetary law has incorporated this disaster financing law with this Solidarity Fund. For financial disasters, we have also set up the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. As regards natural disasters, we are being asked for aid of less than 4% to repair the flood damage in the United Kingdom in June 2007, costing over 4 billion. Nine months to commit appropriations is a long time, because this is by definition an emergency situation. That means that the amending budget method to authorise the commitment is not operational. The amending budget should come into effect earlier to ratify the commitment to be made in advance, with provisional and non-restrictive appropriations for disasters, floods and fires. That being so, EUR 162 million in solidarity for the United Kingdom of Adam Smith, Ricardo and Mrs Thatcher, who only believe in the market, Darwinism and natural selection, is an excellent lesson in pragmatism. When the lion that roars in the economic jungle gets wet, he discovers the virtues of solidarity. That is three times now – mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease and floods – and tomorrow our British Members will also have the chance to show solidarity with the European farmers who have got wet from imports.

 Madam President, the European Commission is so concerned with cohesion between the Member States and within the Member States that 350 billion euros have been allocated to it between now and 2013. A Green Paper is also in the offing because, in Brussels, whenever a problem arises a paper has to be written on it. There certainly is a problem of cohesion between western Europe and eastern Europe, the Europe of villages and the Europe of cities, or the Europe of the upmarket districts and the Europe of working-class neighbourhoods. But whose fault is it? Who depopulated villages where they tended vines and reared cattle, Madam President, in Greece, where they produced tobacco, cotton and olive oil? Who, and which policies, took away thousands of post offices in Sweden, Germany and France? Who closed down rural train stations, railways and maternity homes? In ports, is it the wind destroying fishing craft, fishermen’s livelihoods, small businesses and shipyards? Is it the wolves in the Pyrenees or the Alps that are eating up the shepherds, or lamb imported from New Zealand? We all know the answer: it was the international trade policy conducted by the Commission through GATT agreement and the WTO that has been leading to the closure of 90 farms a day in Spain and France for the last 20 years. It was the dogmatic removal of customs protection that destroyed industrial balances beneath a wave of imports. Now, in order to establish cohesion, first we have to establish coherence between policies. We cannot have one policy in Cotonou for the ACP states and then destroy this policy in Geneva over the banana trade. We cannot have a Community preference for rural produce between 1962 and 1986 and then destroy all this with free trade at the Uruguay or Doha Rounds. Cohesion therefore requires a certain amount of coherence between choices. Commissioner, either we build Europe or we build the world. Either we focus on social tasks, or we focus on the world.

Madam President, while wishing Mr Harbour a happy birthday, I have to say that we appear to have travelled back in time here to the 1990s. Back then we were busily churning out legislation in preparation for the single market, and apparently we are still at it, because today we have before us two further regulations and a decision for ensuring the free movement of goods. There is no getting away from facts, and the fact is that governments are keen on protection – not to say protectionism. Technical standards and form filling and safety requirements all make for non-tariff barriers. In car-producing France, for example, we had years of insistence on yellow headlamps instead of white ones as a means of limiting the number of foreign vehicles on our roads. Now we have the Commission proposing a common framework for the free marketing of bicycles and ladders – for dads to fall off; toys that place children in mortal danger; kettles for scalding their mums; and various appliances on which grans and grandads can get themselves electrocuted. We were under the impression – 23 years after the signing of the Single European Act – that it was all done and dusted: that the Cassis de Dijon judgment in 1979, followed by a couple of hundred more Court of Justice rulings, had ensured mutual recognition of everyone’s products by everyone else. Well, we were wrong! The single market is still a multiple market and so, to eliminate all the regulatory and technical niggles that have the effect of subtly re-erecting borders, the Commission suggests we adopt the principle that importers bear the cost: importers are to be responsible for the safety of the products they import, and the burden of proof is to be reversed. That said, the texts before us are an exercise in stating the obvious: they reassert the concept of mutual recognition; they bow to the mania for labelling – which is termed marking – with the CE logo, its approved dimensions and sanctions for its improper use; and low and behold, 15 years after the dismantling of borders and customs controls, our rapporteur André Brie demands more resources for customs officers. Reinstating customs officers in a free-trade zone is quite something, although apparently Adam Smith, that doyen of free trade, did spend his last days strolling round his hometown in his father’s customs uniform! So I say, let’s do it: let’s bring back customs officers complete with traditional peaked caps. We will probably need to import the caps from China but at least we will make sure they are safe. After all, we wouldn’t want to be responsible for any members of the Commission catching sunstroke!

Mr President, international law is quite clear on this point. As far as Kosovo is concerned a state is said to exist when, firstly, it has a population, secondly a territory and, thirdly, public services. There are no public services in Kosovo, and the Commission only needs to go there to see as much. The only service that operates there is the mafia. A state is sovereign when it has full powers of authority. Proof, as the President of Parliament has just told us, that Kosovo’s powers of authority have been in a state of supervised sovereignty. A state is sovereign when its authority is independent, autonomos
 in Greek, that is to say when it can decide for itself what it does. In Kosovo it is NATO and the United States that decide. A state is sovereign when its authority is exclusive. Within the territory of Kosovo, however, there are several forces at work, not just a single one. A state is sovereign when it respects the principle of uti possidetis
, the inviolability of borders. In other words, Kosovo does not meet any of the criteria required of a sovereign state under international law. And why? Because after setting up delinquent states and gangster states we are now inventing laboratory states where the European Commission tests and invents federalism by breaking-up countries.

Madame President, the suicides of Renault and Peugeot workers in France and the thousands of cases of lung cancer among people whose jobs involve contact with asbestos are clear evidence that health at work is a problem. In response, the European Commission has produced a communication elevated to the status of a ‘health strategy’, which in fact reads like something from Walt Disney – a resolution drafted by Snow White for the Seven Dwarfs. And it really is quite touching. In paragraph 35, for example, we are told that we need healthy lifestyles at the workplace; paragraph 29 is about encouraging medical examinations; paragraph 54 urges the installation of fire sprinklers; in paragraph 49 we read that stress is a threat to health; and recital D suggests, low and behold, that fatal accidents are more common among construction workers than among senior European civil servants. Luckily, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry has solutions to offer, including the employment of a psychologist and a chaplain for every 500 employees. We are actually told nothing, however, about the causes of occupational illness – of which there are three. The first is the ideology of dismantling protection at our borders, thus placing our workers in unfair competition with Asian slave labour. The only way our industries can survive is by going all out for higher productivity, at the expense of health. The second problem is the daft policy of the strong euro, making us uncompetitive in terms of exchange rates. The only variable left to adjust is productivity, which is forced up once again, and once again health is compromised. The third cause of our troubles is the neurotic philosophy of competitiveness – in effect an economic war between Europe and Asia or Europe and Latin America. But wars result in casualties and deaths, and the victims in this case are the people afflicted by occupational illness and accidents. In other words, the European worker is out there like a bull in the global economic arena, stressed and bloody and giving his all, until his health has gone. The solution is to take our workers out of that global arena with its unfair rules, and that will require new customs technology for deductible customs duties.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, this proposal for a regulation for the introduction of remote sensing via satellite is an interesting one. Michel Debatisse, the French farmers’ leader, put forward a remote-sensing proposal in this Chamber back in the 1990s, the area of application in that case being stock rearing. The idea was to fix microchips in the ears of cattle and sheep, as part of a system for monitoring premium payments and preventing fraud in certain parts of southern France. There had even been a plan for electronic capsules, which cattle would swallow and which would then become attached in a pocket in the intestine, enabling the stock to be identified and counted via satellite. What we have before us today is something different, although it dates back seven years, to the MARS and LUCAS pilot projects. The concept here entails supplying information about land use and the condition of the ground or crops, in order to forecast crop yields and, at the same time, to manage agricultural markets and produce econometric models. There is an obvious danger with this aim of gathering information, improving statistics, producing forecasts and, indeed, creating a website: I am tempted to call it the danger of a remote-sensing elite, for the technology will be accessible only to large farmers or very rich regions, and not everyone will be enabled to anticipate prices – a particularly useful facility when the price of grain is rising. Obviously, the ability to anticipate prices several months in advance by predicting the harvest is a highly interesting prospect for the stock markets in Chicago or wherever. Our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, is right to be particularly interested in the matter of who will benefit from the system, especially as it comes at a price – I believe some ten million euros are involved, albeit spread over five or six years – and these sums will come not from an independent budget line but from an agricultural guarantee fund. The system is certainly worth trying out, or pursuing, Commissioner.

The wine-growing people of Languedoc and Roussillon – of the red-grounded Cross of Toulouse, symbolising the century of revolt that began with Marcelin Albert in 1907 and continued with André Castéra in 1976, the people whose land stretches from the Rhone to the Garonne – are under threat from the European Commission. It wants to remove them and plant their lands instead with colonies of retired Brits. Tea drinkers are to oust the men who live by harvesting grapes and making wine in the Minervois, in Corbières and Costières and the Picpoul vineyards. This is a crime against civilisation! And it is being perpetrated under the mendacious cover of alleged over-production. But what is the truth? The truth is the 150 000 hectares of illegal vineyards in Spain and Italy. It is those illegal vines that ought to be grubbed up, because what is being talked of as excess production is, in fact, excess importation – amounting to 12 million hectolitres every year. Moreover, for every vine that we grub up, a new one will be planted on the Pacific Rim; and when China develops a taste for wine we are likely to find ourselves with a worldwide shortage.

 Commissioner, beyond its technique on envelopes, premiums or plantings, this project – the third in 15 years – boils down to three ideas focused on a single objective. The first idea is Malthusianism. The winemakers are not to the Commission’s liking, so it wants to grub up, throw away the grapes, ban chaptalisation and curb production, in the same way as the milk or wheat shortages were brought about. The second idea is laissez-faire capitalism for profit, laissez-faire for plantings, imports, watering down, adding wood shavings, fake wine, must imported to concoct a global wine gruel. The third idea is globalism. After the single market and the single currency comes the single wine: a flavoursome woody ‘parkerised’ Coca-Cola wine, which would not even require any winemakers, because the real aim is to free up the Mediterranean’s winelands, especially those 250 000 hectares around Languedoc-Roussillon, two and a half billion square metres of land, where they will grub up the vineyards to plant houses, a market worth a thousand billion euro. The COM in wine would eventually become a COM in property. Here I am thus the Member for the winemaking Indians. I do not wish to take your scalp, Commissioner; All I want is for winemakers, who have been making people happy for over 2 000 years, to be left alone.

The Commission can never get it right on the subject of VAT. In the 1980s the Cockfield Report called for a range of VAT rates. In fact, there was only a minimum rate of 15%, 5% as the normal rate and the lower rate. Then the European Commission wanted VAT at the rate applied by the country of origin. In practice VAT was levied at the rate applied by the country of destination. It was a provisional system that became a definitive system: the so-called ‘Bolkenstein VAT’ was not introduced. There were now lower rates of VAT for French catering entities, CDs and activities generating a workforce. The Commission gave in at least provisionally in its list in Annex H to the Sixth Directive in 1977, because it realised that Germans could hardly drive their Mercedes to a cross-border lunch at the low-VAT restaurant. What a shame it did not realise in 1993 that with no border controls intra-Community VAT was an inexhaustible source of large-scale fraud. The philosophical logic of VAT, an intelligent tax since it is economically neutral, is inaccessible to the vast majority of Commission officials. That is why their legislation has failed constantly on this issue for the past 20 years.

 ‘Flexicurity’ is a smokescreen masking the commoditisation of work and of workers. This smokescreen appears to have come from Denmark. After the Swedish model of the 1960s, the Yugoslav model of self-management of the 1970s, the everlasting Mao model, the ex-Soviet model, the Blairist and even the Zappatist model, we now have the Danish model. It is ‘Andersen-mania’, Margaret Thatcher disguised as the little mermaid to make us think that if we give ‘disposable workers’ a few allowances, some training and rapid re-integration we are making them more secure. Denmark has more strike days than France, but never mind that. Flexicurity has made it a paradise of flexible labour markets and happy workers (though you have to wonder why they still go on strike…). What is the truth in all this? The truth is that we are trying to create ‘Mindongs’ in Europe, like the Chinese ‘half-farmers, half-labourers’ working under the worst possible conditions. The whole idea is to reduce the level of protection offered by the Social Security Code and the Labour Code. ‘Flexicurity’ is phariseeism applied to labour law. The economic result – as with the reduction in social security contributions, which has failed to end the imbalance in production costs between Asia and Europe – will be illusory.

Mr President, colleagues: globalisation, internationalisation, or ‘planetisation’ as the Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin would have it, is obviously here to stay, and what we are seeing now is a second wave of globalisation, more comprehensive than that of the 1990s because it embraces finance, the economy, language, population movement and ideology, with a single dominant model – namely the market. The negative effects of this globalisation are equally obvious: in the southern hemisphere where resources are being over-exploited, in India and China where people, land, forests, seas and rivers are affected and human rights are jeopardised. Here in the North we see the impact in corporate relocations, job losses and financial destabilisation of our social systems, and in the risk – as our population ages and we face the cost of caring for the very elderly – that Europe will turn into a geriatric Rwanda, with all the implications of that in terms of disregard for human life and violation of human rights. Confronted by these realities, faced with the obvious, what is our response? It would seem to be a mixture of magic words, minimalism and mumbo-jumbo. We hear the magic words, for example, in our current debates and resolutions. Our political ‘spells’ consist of references to the Lisbon Strategy and a more competitive economy. It is reminiscent of Khrushchev at the UN in the 1960s, trying to catch up with the capitalist system. It is the Harry Potter answer to globalisation. Then there is the minimalism. The perfect example is the Globalisation Fund: a little poke of financial sweeties. Unable to control what is going on, we then look to the heavens and try the old mumbo-jumbo. In the name of the Father, Adam Smith; the Son, David Ricardo; and the Holy Spirit of the Market; before the great global altar of free-trade ideology, we make the sacrifice of cutting and then eliminating customs duties. Utter mumbo-jumbo! Yet Europe’s greatest invention, the product of its genius 2 500 years ago, was logical thought: reason! What reason tells us today is that free trade is necessary, but it is equally necessary to protect our social and cultural assets. So we have to find a way of reconciling free trade with human security. We actually have the capacity to do that, thanks to a new form of customs technology. I am talking about the technology of deductible customs duties: under this system, customs duties are of course payable by exporters but their payments give those exporters an equivalent amount of customs credit, deductible against the cost of purchases in the importing country. This new generation of variable, refundable, negotiable customs duties, subject to rebates, will enable us to solve the all too familiar problem of economic, social and environmental imbalances in international trade between North and South.

 Mr President, for budget debates, there is a well-known law we call the law of the three ‘Ls’, because budget debates involve reeling off Litanies, like in a religious Liturgy, which ends up causing economic Lethargy. We are finding this with the 2008 budget. The litanies first. Mr Virrankoski reels off these litanies like Mr Elles did in 2006, and like our fellow Member Mr Garriga Polledo did in 2005. First of all, the litany of cutting off appropriations: in the draft budget, the Council of Ministers cuts off the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget. Mr Mulder has explained to us that this is quite normal for agriculture, for example. The European Parliament, however, is proposing to restore the appropriations. The litany is also one of a budget consistently below the ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. The multiannual financial framework is already very short of the necessary appropriations and the budget even more so. It is a cascade of Malthusianism. It is also a litany of political priorities: year after year, fighting poverty, education, training, agricultural multifunctionality and the seventh framework programme on research are mentioned, and that is where the liturgy comes in. The liturgy is primarily in the budgetary nomenclature and the ideology supporting that nomenclature. The nomenclature is the presentation of the budget by activity, the preparation of the budget by activity. In practice, the expenditure is chopped up into titles, into political fields, which correspond to the directorates-general. The budget is like a huge salami, a type of grocer’s shop inventory, the problem being, as the rapporteur has seen, that dividing the budget up by activity creates confusion with the multiannual financial framework, which is split into broader categories. One has five categories: competitiveness, preservation of natural resources, freedom, the EU as a global partner, administration, and the other has about thirty political activities, and the correspondence between these categories is difficult to establish. All this is done in the name of a budgetary ideology, the ideology of performance, competitiveness, effectiveness, efficiency and results, and this creates a jumble of nebulous tools, results indicators, performance indicators, activities sheets. This budgetary technology is presented as new, as being in the vanguard of budgetary intelligence, but it is actually something quite old, dating back to 1947. It was the American Hoover Committee that first talked about the concepts of performance, cost/benefit, efficiency, targets and results. It was this that gave the US the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System in the 1960s under the Johnson Presidency, and that under President Carter gave the BBZ, or budget base zero – the budgetary performance ideology that subsequently spread to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France in 2001 with its organic law on finance laws, and even Mexico in 2006. One might understand from this why the European budget is lacking in transparency and really in efficiency too. The European Parliament does not contain 100 people capable of understanding the European budget by activity, with the consequence that this entails: the economic lethargy of the European Union. Because if there is no Galileo, if there is no Lyon-Turin link, if there is no Genoa-Barcelona link, if the capital cities are not connected by high-speed trains, if the research budget is not what it should be, if the budget for a Europe of 27 Member States is the same as the Spanish budget, if the European budget is one twentieth of the budget of the United States, it is precisely because of this Malthusian ideology. Perhaps it is time we realised that alongside the ordinary budget, we need an extraordinary budget to make loans financed by a major European loan, which would permit investment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chatzimarkakis, we are short of cereals, we are short of milk, the price of maize and butter are soaring, and what are we doing? We are discussing putting premiums per cow, per ewe or per hectare on the Internet and, while the world is about to go hungry, like teenagers we are playing at organising farming and financial emails on the Internet. Of course, there are good reasons: transparency, the right to find out and control what is being done with the billions being paid to farmers. However, in a democracy, control is exercised by Parliament in the Chamber, and not by surfers on the Web. Also, if transparency applies to agricultural credits, why not also, in a spirit of populism, have transparency over the pay of the EU’s senior officials? If we are putting premiums for dairy cows online, why not also put the premiums being milked by senior officials online too? That is the first injustice. There is a second. Small farmers will be transparent, but large commercial agricultural companies will not be. That is because the real objective of this regulation is not transparency. It is a diabolical machine of war, which has two hidden aims. The first is to divide farmers into large and small and destroy their unity in the trade unions. The next, and most important, is to stir up public opinion against farmers through the press, particularly the British press which will highlight the premiums received by Prince Charles and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, by the trade union leaders, the large farmers, and perhaps even the husband of Mrs Fischer Boel, who is a pig farmer. Using these few examples of large landowners fed on hormones from Brussels, public opinion will be made to believe that farmers get a huge boost, particularly because the public does not know that farmers are paid against their will because they are banned from producing. They are forced to leave land fallow. Once public opinion against farmers – paid not to produce because of decoupling – has become white hot, in 2013, at no political or electoral risk, it will be possible to remove the aid and recover about EUR 20 billion to finance other non-agricultural activities. In the guise of democratic transparency, this regulation is a moral ignominy that is using the odious motivations of envy and jealousy to serve the Commission’s strategic plot since the 1980s: to do away with agricultural exports as part of a major worldwide agreement. Agriculture for the southern hemisphere, and financial, banking and energy services for the northern hemisphere. That is the truth about this regulation!

The Commission in Brussels has been telling us since 1992 that there were grain mountains, to say nothing of the oceans of milk and other larders full to bursting. The agricultural land of Europe therefore had to be put on set-aside and production had to be scaled back. The southern hemisphere and the US were calling on the WTO for a monopoly on wheat and oilseed. Remember that as part of the Uruguay Round, and with the Blair House Accord of 1992, the European Commission agreed to limit our oilseed growing areas to 5 million hectares. What was supposed to happen happened. Agriculture is subject to the vagaries of climate. In the Bible Joseph explained as much to Pharaoh. Drought in Australia, falling production in Ukraine and no end to the growing demand in China, India and Africa: all of these factors are driving up the price of grain and maize. After having paid our farmers not to produce from 1993 on, even after having removed aid to production and after having put millions of hectares on set-aside when one third of humanity is going hungry, the Commission in Brussels now discovers that there is a shortage of grain and that stocks have collapsed. They are thus going back on their decision on set-aside. It will be the same for wine. It has already happened for butter and meat. Confusion and Malthusianism are running the show.

Children in Vietnam, Africa and elsewhere are standing on land mines. In Europe our own children are being suffocated and poisoned and are developing allergies because of Barbie dolls and toys. The cinema has already sounded the alarm bells with the film ‘Le père noël est une ordure
’. It is now up to us, the Members of this Parliament, to react and to do so on safety principles as well as to protect the demographic future of our continent, which has already been afflicted by the games played by adults at large. It is time to do this now. Even yesterday was not soon enough, for how many faces with skin as smooth as a Brancusi sculpture have been ravaged by celluloid dolls that burst into flames at the slightest hint of a match. Toys kill and the children of Darfur do not know how lucky they are in not being able to play at eating.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the common market organisation for sugar worked. It was cheap and offered access to our market to ACP countries. However, during the WTO negotiations, Thailand, Australia and particularly Brazil insisted on a sugar monopoly. At the same time, to win allies during the Doha Round, Pascal Lamy, who was at the time European Commissioner for Trade, offered to abolish customs duty for the 49 least developed countries with the ‘Everything but arms’ programme. In 2009-2010, Europe will begin to see imports of sugar in theory from poor countries, but which was produced with Kuwaiti, Saudi or other capital, in the Sudan or elsewhere. European beet growers and sugar producers in outermost regions must therefore be sacrificed for the benefit of Brazil and other countries, hence the 2006 reform. The same applies to cereals and milk. Soon it will apply to wine. Our producers will disappear, which in Europe is what we call ‘restructuring’. Of course, we pay cereal growers to stop growing crops: we call it ‘restructuring aid’, like the set-aside payment or the grubbing-up premium. However, 18 months after this aid programme began, it is not working. Commissioner, you are giving us the same old speech about grain mountains and milk lakes. You are saying that in 2007-2008, there will be a 4 million tonne surplus, hence the two proposals today for a regulation to obtain the abandonment, apparently, of almost 4 million tonnes of sugar. We are increasing financial incentives and annual withdrawals, and additional payments and subsidies. Of course, this aid will stop after 2010 and our farmers will be wiped out, just like the ACP producers, not to mention workers. The only winners will be importers. These Malthusian policies 
have been applied to cereals since 1993. At 9 o’clock, Mr Parish told us that there was a wheat shortage, that prices were rocketing and that set-aside needed to be abandoned. So there is some hope at least: in 2011, there will be a new regulation telling us that there is a sugar shortage and that we need to start growing it again!

 Madam President, Members of the Council, in 1977, under the Carter Administration, two probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched into space. You may think this has nothing to do with our debate. However, in these two probes, the late physicist Carl Sagan placed a message from President Waldheim, the drawing of a man and a woman, the principal mathematical formulas known on Earth, and a record with the sound of the wind, of a tractor, a baby, and extracts from Mozart, Beethoven and Chuck Berry. Last year, these two probes left the solar system, or the ‘heliosphere’, as it is called, to travel 42 000 light years to the nearest star; in other words, 200 000 kilometres multiplied by 3 600, multiplied by 24, multiplied by 365, multiplied by 42 000. In 30 years, these two probes have not sent back any signals, since none have been picked up. For the time being, the only known life is on Earth. From that perspective, it is evident that the penal codes of Texas or China, which can allow something as extraordinarily rare as life to be ended, are a real aberration. By contrast, the Portuguese proposal for a conference about life and human dignity reflects the perspective of this nation of explorers, because to be opposed to the death penalty is only one aspect of the challenge and of the political teleology. The aim of any policy can only be rich and diverse life. To be against the death penalty is all very well, but it is only one aspect, as is euthanasia, of a central political problem: what is the point of politics? To create the economic, social and physical conditions so that this mysterious thing called ‘life’ can flourish, or the Malthusian policy of no future, austerity pacts, rationing, prohibition, grubbing-up, Herod premiums, and the British foot-and-mouth slaughters and pyres? This is the crux of the matter and the real scale of the death penalty: it is this political choice between no future and life.

 It is all very well to legislate on milk, on its distribution in schools or the army, or on the creation of a new category, but the dairy sector is something else. In the 1980s, the Commission in Brussels told us that there were milk lakes and butter mountains. As with cereals, then, a policy of ‘Malthusian bureaucracy’ was introduced. Under the impetus of the French Agriculture Minister, Michel Rocard, milk quotas were invented. That is, rationing, the deliberate fabrication of scarcity. For the first time in the history of humanity, people were preventing themselves from producing, and were rejecting the riches offered naturally by nature. Worse still, to be certain of achieving scarcity, we went as far as the daft premium for the slaughter of cattle. What was bound to happen has happened. The barriers to production have limited production. From milk lakes to the Aral Sea of milk. There is a shortage of butter. Prices are rising. This shortage was organised, in the same way as for wheat.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the reports by our two colleagues, including the one by Mrs Fraga, relate to this insoluble problem of fisheries – insoluble because fish stocks are limited and demand is constantly increasing. Consequently, the fisheries policy is not the CAP. Since 1968 and Sicco Mansholt, the Commission has for 40 years been making a strategic mistake with the CAP, which amounts to a crime against humanity: humanity needs cereals and milk and they are in short supply as the increase in prices shows. With fisheries policy it is different. The Commission’s mistakes simply come from its normal, technocratic sin, but not from a strategic crime. Management of fish stocks with TACs, quotas, FIFGs and MAGPs has failed. The Commission has legislated on everything: nets, tonnages, fleet power, number of units and when all is said and done – as the rapporteur tells us – there are fewer fishermen, less cod and even less bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, hence the fury of fishermen in June and July. Where I come from, for example, in the port of Sète or Le Grau-du-Roi, the fishermen who use thonaille fishing, which is traditional coastal fishing with small nets, were protesting that they could not fish from July onwards. Nevertheless, despite all these checks, all this destruction, all these sanctions – perhaps one day they will even put electronic tags on fishermen to monitor them – the stocks are in danger, the rapporteur tells us. The Common Fisheries Policy has not worked, and why? Because the problem is worldwide: China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Peru fish. As with wine, where we are pulling up as the rest of the world is planting, we are breaking up our boats as the United States are building more of them and as Russia, Iceland and Norway are increasing the engine size of their vessels. You can invent indicators, a type of maximum sustainable yield, but if your neighbour is fishing more, you fishing less will not improve stocks. Moreover, because farming, or aquaculture, is not a real solution either because of fishmeal, fisheries is therefore the perfect demonstration that the Community level is both too high when the fishing is coastal and the decision should be local, or too low when the fishing is deep-sea. In these cases, either we will very quickly rise to global level with the help of scientists, or by the end of the twenty-first century, we will be going to the cinema to fish for the last Nemos.

The pairing of ‘Medicines and poor countries of the South’ poses a problem in terms of the reconciling of ‘Intellectual property law of pharmaceutical laboratories and human rights to health care’. In Hong Kong, the WTO summit reached an agreement, the results of which have yet to be felt in the areas of tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS. Medicines, whether generic or not, are not accessible to the people. However, the substance of this audacious solution presupposes that the ‘common heritage of mankind’ concept, dating back to the 1960s, has been taken up here. Major diseases are spread worldwide by people migrating and travelling. These diseases can strike down mankind. We saw this with SARS and avian influenza. Therefore, for worldwide diseases, we need worldwide medicines. Medicines that are used to treat worldwide diseases must have a ‘common heritage of mankind patent’. The legal status of these 21st century patents would be open, as would the tax to be paid from intergovernmental contributions. Thought may be given to ‘public-private partnerships’ involving ‘multinational pharmaceutical companies and the WHO’ or governments. Thought may be also given to a ‘Company’ with international status, of the type stipulated for sea bed exploitation. The important thing is the innovative principle of the worldwide management of the risks of worldwide pandemics.

Mr President, it is a good thing to table a resolution on Iraq for the sake of the humanitarian situation, refugees, international aid and so on. Who would not agree, moreover, with recital A and its finding that 100 people are killed and 200 are wounded each day, 70% of the population is without water, 3 million people are undernourished and 2 million are refugees, including 500 000 children in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere? Who has done this, though? Who is responsible? Who has spread chaos? Is it Saddam Hussein? Is it the Ba’ath Party? Chaos stems from war, an unjust war in the eyes of the theologians of the Middle Ages, an illegal war according to the UN Charter, a war started on the back of a lie told by two Heads of State, those of the US and the United Kingdom. Who supported this war, here, in the European Parliament? Who justified, who requested, who approved the intervention that led to chaos? The current French foreign affairs minister, Mr Kouchner, and some of the signatories to this resolution did. What are we supposed to say? That it is good to be humanitarian and to deal with the effects, but that it is better to be preventive and to avert the causes? This is the problem of political Europe! In Europe we are so fond of human rights that, everywhere – in Palestine, in Iraq, in Africa, in the field of economic globalisation – we support policies that, violating as they do these human rights, enable us to reaffirm our immense love of these very human rights, which are ultimately violated with our prior support. It is therefore good that post-trauma centres for refugees are being proposed in paragraph 16, but provision must also be made for political prevention centres, here, for our leaders, so that they can be taught wisdom, lucidity and the courage to say 'no', and taught to reject naïve optimism, which destroys everything in its wake.

 Madam President, our further discussion of the importation of the skins of two million slaughtered Chinese dogs and cats is comparable to that which we had in the 1990s, when we returned on three occasions to discussing the importation from the Arctic regions of the furs of animals killed in leghold traps. On each occasion, whether we were talking about seals, dogs, cats or foxes, I am sorry to have to say that the Commission played for time and allowed the trade to continue to the greater glory of the Market Almighty. Let us never forget that, in March 1996, despite proof that mad cow disease was capable of being transmitted to humans, the Commission threatened four German Länder
 with sanctions for their refusal to allow the importation of suspect cattle. The lesson one can learn from all that is that the logic of the market demands that everything be capable of being bought or sold or used as a means to making a profit, whether it be dogs, cats, kidneys, eyes, women, children, slaves, or workers. That is why the economy must be subject to political constraints, in order that those great values that are beyond price may be re-established.

Madam President, work for all, and decent work at that! But what is it? It is the work of young people, of women, of children, in the United Kingdom or in Portugal; it is the work of migrants, of slaves in diplomatic missions, especially in the Middle East; it is the work of employees in France; it is those who commit suicide at work, at Renault for example; it is the obscene salaries – EUR 1 000 per month for cashiers, builders, workmen – that make it possible precisely to re-form the workforce; and, at the end of a life of exploitation, it is the retirements of shame: EUR 130 for a farm woman’s husband. When it costs EUR 10 to impound a dog, one cannot even impound a retired farm woman! What are the causes? Well, the causes are the new forms of global capitalism, which is not industrial capitalism, but financial capitalism, in search of a 15% return. In order to obtain such a profit, the capitalism of pension funds, speculative funds, hedge funds, exerts three types of pressure: on salaries, on employees – who use just-in-time methods and who are stressed, hence the suicides – and on the number of employees. Another cause is the immigrant workers from Latin America and Africa to El Ejido in Andalusia, in workshops, in the restaurants of Barcelona, on worksites. It is globalisation, where Chinese workers on 25 cents an hour become the model international worker. What should we do? Four things: we should wage social battles, we should wage legal battles, at the ILO and the WTO, by showing imagination, not least with deductible customs duties, we should wage political battles and, above all, we should be clear-sighted and call things by their true name – the deregulated market is capitalism and globalisation, and it is also worldwide financial capitalism.

On the objectives of finally getting the countries of the South out of poverty, we are all agreed – even if the real measures are still not being taken for Black Africa, and by that, I mean the sharing out of water, food, basic medicines and education. As a tool for fighting poverty, international trade is necessary, but inadequate. It may be adequate in the long term but, as Keynes said: ‘in the long term we shall all be dead’. Momentum and innovation are therefore required, not least through the invention of a new customs technology of deductible customs duties in the form of a customs credit offered by importers to exporters, to be deducted upon purchase from the economy of the importing country and equal to the sum of the customs duty to which the credit is charged. For the countries of the South, this customs credit would be subsidised, along the lines of matching credits and sparing credits, which already exist in international taxation. In this way, poor countries would no longer lose the precious revenue from their customs duties.

Madam President, Commissioner, the Berlin Wall may have fallen, the Soviet Empire may belong in the past, the world has become globalised, but there is at least one thing that is unchanging, a place where history has come to a standstill, which is Palestine, the Palestine that is becoming mankind’s black hole: Gaza, the camps, rockets, intifadas, attacks, one land for two peoples, a long war that has been going on for sixty years now. It is also a great jungle of myths, with esplanades, tombs, patriarchs, temples, mosques, monotheism and cynicism, a cynicism shared, moreover, by the hardliners on both sides. On the Israeli side, there is technology, force, the elimination of Arafat, of Fatah, economic strangulation, the prisoners, in short, everything, but most definitely not negotiations, Iran over Iraq, Shi’ism over Baathism, and, on the Palestinian side, the hardliners clearly have demographics on their side in the long term. In the meantime, three generations have already been sacrificed, and what do we do? Well, we make statements, visits, humanitarian missions –
 do we not, Mr Solana? That is all! The fact is, this conflict is the descendant of the European conflicts of 1914–1918 and 1939–45, and we are not doing what we should be doing, we are indulging in Pharisaism. We know, however, that we should go further than emergency meetings, that we should stop the embargos, that we should invest, that we need a European Camp David, with all of the parties – 
not only Israel, Palestine and its government of unity, but also Syria, Iran and Lebanon –
 and we know that we must state the two rights, the right of the Israeli State to exist in perpetuity, of course, but also the right of the Palestinian State to exist, to be recognised.

Mr President, we were told in 1990 that rate brackets were needed. In 1992, we were told that minimum rates were needed. Now we are being told that floating minimum rates are needed, and always for the same reason: the eugenics, the health neurosis of the Protestant Europe, which should lead us to impose internal customs duties, to erect fiscal barriers, of up to nearly two euros per litre of wine, in Denmark or in the United Kingdom for example. But if our British, Danish or Swedish friends wish to impose taxes, let them do so! The Mediterranean countries, Germany and Luxembourg impose zero excise duties on wine. Everybody is free, if they so wish, to take drugs rather than to drink, but we do not try to solve the drug problem through taxation. And we do not create health safety, if I dare say so, by means of taxation. Let them drink, let them live! There are endless maximum limits: we do not need minimum limits!

Mr President, Commissioner, a single market, a single currency, and now even the sky is to become single, this is confirmation that European integration is a legal, financial and economic monotheism, which, like all monotheisms, has the power to expand. We can see it here with the Council’s ultimately positive decision concerning a Multilateral Agreement for the Establishment of a European Aviation Area common to the European Union, to the Balkan States, to Iceland and to Norway, that is, if I have counted correctly, to 37 countries. This legal corpus, once again positive, is a multilateral agreement: 35 articles, 4 annexes and 8 protocols. National laws are being brought into line with each other. We are establishing a common market for aviation transport, and, my God, unification happens more quickly in the sky than on earth. Here we have one agreement that establishes a continental aviation law under five main headings: the right of establishment, aviation safety in Article 11, aviation security particularly in times of terrorist threats and hijackings, air traffic management and, of course, competition, with State aid, public contracts and the marketing of goods. In addition to all the classic rules common to all these multilateral treaties, that is, rules for the settlement of disputes, for interpretation, for implementation, and here, implementation that allows for application in stages, with the classic problem, once again, of the starting date and provisional application. For once, we can only welcome something that should make life easier both for companies and for natural persons.

 Unlike the ECSC, which funded itself from own resources in the true sense of the word, the European Union, having virtually ceased, as a consequence of global free trade, to collect customs duties, which now account for no more than 9.8% of its resources, the European Budget is provided for in the same way as any other unremarkable state-funded inter-governmental organisation, that is to say by a cash contribution on the basis of GNP, amounting to 73.8% of the Community’s resources. Today, the resources have reached a ceiling of 1.24% of GNP, and that is where they are going to stay. It is simply provided that, after 2014, a new system will come into play, one derived from the traditional federal solution of sharing the yield from a tax between the EU and the nation states. A selection of twelve taxes has been proposed to be divided up in this way, ranging from VAT to the Tobin tax and the eco-tax on companies. It is the system adopted in France between 1791 and 1917, with percentages added to the state tax in order to fund local communities. If the EU were to have a policy of large-scale investment in health, research, the universities and the railways to replace the Malthusian approach set out in Article 104(c) of the Treaty of Maastricht, the support of the public at nation-state level would make possible either their funding by means of loans or even indeed a hypothecated tax made appetising by its benefit to society.

Against the backdrop of the globalisation of finance, agriculture, migration and the market, the nations of Europe must form an alliance of civilisation with the countries of Central America. Our farmers, for example, are basically confronted with problems similar to those of the campesinos
 in Mexico or of Latin American SMIs, faced, as they are, with the confiscation of their intellectual property, their expertise and, above all, faced with their gradual wiping out by a global trade system that pits our banana producers in the French West Indies and the Canaries against producers from Honduras or Nicaragua, solely to benefit multinationals like Chiquita. The need for this alliance of civilisation between Europe and Latin America becomes all the more clear in the light of global migrations. Therefore, if, in the 1970s, French manufacturers in the car, steel and building industries had turned to the Latin American workforce instead of to that of Aures, Anatolia and Kabylia, French society would have avoided today’s tensions and public budgets would have avoided heavy expenses. By entering into an alliance with Europe, Latin America would find the allies it needs, within international and trade forums, to defend a concept of the management of human societies and economies that are different from the Anglo-Saxon ideology of the market’s being everything.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for once it is a pleasure to read Mrs Bourzai’s report. It is clear, well written, well documented and comes with a good proposal. With the veal market, once again, we come face to face with the distortions of competition, indeed frauds, brought about by the single market in all fields. We shall be called upon to speak about it again in relation to wine, Commissioner, with countries that have a land registry and others that do not, with the composition of wines that can vary depending on the country while the description remains the same. There is also the area of VAT, with the intracommunity frauds that the single market allows, with fiscal dumping and our Baltic friends who benefit from their ‘flat tax’, to give themselves an advantage. There is, of course, the veal market, where, if there is not fraud, there is unfair competition. Forgive me, Mr President, but they say that our Spanish or Danish friends have old calves more than eight, nine or ten months old, sort of grandfather calves, that they still call ‘veal’. Obviously, with a price difference of two or three euros on leaving the abattoir, according to whether it is a real calf or an extremely old grandfather calf, it is sure that the added value can be extremely profitable, even though 800 000 tonnes of calves are not all involved – thank God! – since 80% of the production and 70% of the consumption takes place in countries that have harmonised the definition of veal or of vitellone. The distortion of competition is, therefore, limited, but it does exist. Commissioner, after almost 20 years in Parliament, for once I congratulate the Commission, which proves that you should never give up hope about anything. The system that has been proposed to us is excellent. First of all defining the age of veal according to a fixed limit of more or less than eight months old is very clear, just as it is very clear to distinguish them by two letters, X and Y. In this respect, there was an ambiguity, hormonal or sexual or something, and the rapporteur did well to propose the letter V as veal and the letter Z as, we do not quite know what, but it is better. Providing for a system of penalties is excellent and extending the legislation to meat based preserves, that is very good. Excluding AOCs and IGPs, everyone can only be delighted about that. After all, Mr President, Commissioner, perhaps all that offers us a good example: if one could define right or left wing politicians according to their age, according to their diet, according to whether they are monogastric or according to whether they are mammals, it would make it easier for electors to know whether they are dealing with a left wing calf or a right wing calf. Maybe our rapporteur is proposing this as an avenue for us to explore.

Mr President, as everyone has said, the report by our fellow Member, Mr Ferreira, brings us once again to the heart of this European social model, which sets us apart from the United States. Behind this report, of course, there are children, there are the elderly, there are the sick, there are those excluded from society, there are disabled people and, finally, in the end, if we are not careful, there will be euthanasia, with the Netherlands, Belgium and, soon, France. We are therefore in the realm of what we, the people of France, have for over a century – in thousands of books, lessons and university theses – been calling ‘public services’. That is why, on 29 May 2005, the people of France rejected the constitution of private services. Indeed, with the magnificent word ‘public service’, we are saying that, in a society of women and men, there are shared dimensions of what is owned by a nation as a whole, and that it is within these shared dimensions, such as hospitals, schools and health care, that services are provided to the public. This terminology is superior to that of services of general interest, a term that creates ambiguity and problems in terms of the boundaries between the private sector and the general interest, and between the commercial market – with the competition between overriding interests – and public goods, something that St Thomas Aquinas, back in his day, already used to call the common weal. It is precisely because of this problem of boundaries that we are drafting legislation: what are these services, where do they come from, what budget should be allocated to them, which powers fall under the Union, on the one hand, and subsidiarity, on the other, what geographical boundaries are there between Mrs Thatcher’s Europe and social Europe, what boundary is there in terms of housing, employment, childcare, hospital care, between the rich, who can go private, and the poor, who cannot? One US President had a sign on his desk that read: ‘The buck stops here’. This is the definition of social services of general interest: ‘The market stops here’.

 I wish to ask the Commission the following questions: Assuming that there has been surplus wine production since the 1970s, following 20 years of under-production, which at world level is unclear, why, then, import 12 million hectolitres every year from countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina? If, on the pretext of surplus production, my region of Languedoc-Roussillon has to carry out a programme of grubbing up, why import 12 million hectolitres – the exact equivalent of 15 million hectolitres produced in Languedoc-Roussillon – from countries outside the EU? If there is surplus production, why does Brussels want to authorise must imports from third countries, in order to make flat-pack ‘Ikea wines’? If there is surplus production, why seek to authorise the US practice of adding 7% of water to wine? Why seek to grub up vineyards on our territory when Chile, Australia and the vineyards of the 33rd parallel are planting? ‘When China has drunk too much’, who will give it wine to drink if we grub up vineyards? Of the 400 000 hectares, or 4 billion m2, that have been grubbed up, does the Commission not envisage planting 4 million villas with a real estate value of EUR 100 billion?

Mr President, tribute must be paid to Mr Fava for this report, which does justice to the role of MEP. For four years, CIA flights transporting prisoners have been permitted to stop over in countries in which people actually voted in favour of the European Constitution and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are told that the end justifies the means, but, on this point, the means that consist in infringing people’s dignity and torturing them have led to an all too familiar end: the breeding ground for Islamists has got bigger. Mr Fava has therefore taught us three lessons. Firstly, the United States has eternal leaders, Indians as in the Cold War and during the McCarthy era; it is the student of Carl Schmitt and Heidegger, one is either its unconditional friend or its enemy, as France was three years ago. The second lesson is that, for their part, the European leaders are the children of Machiavelli, and his doublespeak, and of Hanna Arendt, and her banality of evil. The third lesson to be drawn, and a message of hope is that Europe will never go away; it is seemingly led by sheep, but sheep that can be a match for wolves.

In addition to decoupling aid and production, the CAP reform has introduced a new tool: modulation. In practice, this is the option to transfer part of the appropriations, the direct payments to farmers, to rural development appropriations. It is called a ‘transfer from the first pillar to the second pillar’. As much as twenty per cent of the funds may be transferred under voluntary modulation. The Member States may choose this modulation from an abridged menu, rather than from one imposed on them, which serves up 'direct aid' as a main course and 'rural development' as a dessert. In reality, modulation amounts to robbing Paul the farmer to feed Peter the landscape gardener. This is a budgetary technique that is meant to disguise the shortage of appropriations with the impression that one can choose how these scarce appropriations are managed.

 Madam President, Commissioner, since 22 July 1993, the date of the first draft reforms of the wine sector, we have been told that we need to grub up our vines, with figures to support it. In 1993, for example, we were told that consumption in 2000 would fall to 115 million hectolitres, but in fact it was 127 million – the Commission was out by 12 million. We are also told that there is overproduction, but where? On the global market in potable alcohol. there was a shortage of 9 million hectolitres in 2002 and 11 million in 2003. And we know full well that the time has come for wine producers in China, in particular, where Chairman Mao said 'let the people drink wine'. So what is lurking behind these reforms on free plantation, the addition of sugar, distillation, infusions of wood chippings, imports of grape must and, of course, grubbing up? In reality, the Commission is pursuing two aims with this grubbing up of 400 000 hectares, the most violent episode in the global history of wine, because we have to go back to the Emperor Domitian in 92 to find an equivalent: first of all, abandoning our exports of wine to the southern hemisphere by 2015, in exchange for its services market; and secondly for the pensioners of northern Europe to settle gradually in southern Europe. Europe therefore needs a land reserve, and that reserve can be found in the 400 000 hectares that will be grubbed up and replaced by houses – four million houses on four billion square metres, with a turnover of a thousand billion euro. It is this, this land grabbing, that is the true tragedy, because wine is not just a common market organisation: it is more than agriculture, and even more than culture, despite the painters, the 275 poets of wine, and the structures of the 5 000 wine-producing villages of Europe – wine is the interface with the divine. At the wedding in Cana, Jesus' first miracle was to turn water not into whisky and coke, or into Nokia mobile phones, but into wine. Abandoning that, therefore, is not like abandoning New Zealand's sheep or Brazil's chickens – it is abandoning Europe's identity. That, Commissioner, is why you must hold fast to wine, which the Argentinean Jorge Luis Borges called the deep patriarchal river that flows through the history of the world.

 Of course, there is France with its judicial imbroglios; yes, there is Iraq, where those charged with judging the Head of State turned up astride the missiles of the invaders; and, naturally, there is China, where everything is up for sale, even bullets for people to blow their brains out with. Then there is Libya and the case of the Bulgarian nurses. In the 21st century, where, increasingly, the issues are wilfully confused, the death penalty is now carried out in French hospitals, where the old are finished off in order to free up beds and balance the accounts. It is carried out in the Europe of Maastricht where, by pulling the plug on vital investment, we have killed off our future. The ideological scourge of the Reverend Malthus - of zero growth and sustainable underdevelopment – has infected our decision-makers. There would seem not to be enough room at the banqueting table of the human race. So we leave the old to the mercy of heatwaves and lethal injections, and we retire folk early and reduce their working hours. Tax law exerts its stranglehold, labour law may leave no room to breathe and budgetary law short-changes us. Meanwhile, at the top of this ladder of Malthusian penalties, criminal law tops off this society of ours with the culture of death. In the Malthusian economy, the ‘euthanazi state’, the ‘precautionary principle’ and the ultimate penalty of execution are the bedfellows of pride and complacency.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has almost 100 million fat people, unlike Darfur which only has thin people. Of course, there are 800 million children in the world at risk of dying of hunger, while we, for our part, have 14 million obese children, and the number is rising. So what, then, can be done, not to stop them looking like figures painted by Fernando Botero, but to save 7% of our health costs each year? Firstly, there is the option of diets. Apart from the Biafran diet, which is too dangerous, there is the Cretan one, but that requires olive oil, fruit, vegetables and white meats and, unfortunately, the overhauled common agricultural policy is destroying our olive trees and putting our market gardeners, tree growers and poultry farmers out of work. There are also financial regimes, which are very effective. Indeed, obesity declines the further up the income ladder you go. At the top of the ladder, the rich are all thin. The poor need, therefore, to be made richer if they are also to be made thinner. To achieve this, however, we should need to reconsider the Maastricht austerity pact, which produces people excluded from society and, therefore, fat people. As for myself, my only hope is that global warming continues. In that way, European children would get plenty of exercise travelling on their little camels to schools surrounded by sand dunes. I also hope that none of these children with sunken eyes and swollen stomachs will read Mrs Ries’s report, because there are two ways of throwing up: one is to eat too much, and the other is to read a scandalous report like this.

Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Merkel, because, with there being 27 of us now, the next German Presidency of the Union will only take office in 2020 and because you now have to control and steer the Union’s destiny. There are, of course, technical matters, and it would be good, for example, to guarantee our farmers’ future after 2013. Our destiny lies elsewhere, however. If the aim is to find the soul of Europe, Mrs Merkel, there are only two paths to take. The first is that of Orpheus, who went to the underworld for trying to find Eurydice – the European Constitution – whom he lost because he looked back. Mrs Merkel, look forwards! Do not go back, even to constitutional treaties. Instead, make a strategic offer to France that goes beyond the 1963 Elysée Treaty. For instance, faced with the challenges of which you speak, be Churchill rather than Bismarck; propose sharing a symbol – Franco-German co-nationality, for example. However, since you are searching for the soul of Europe, the second path is that of the world that Europe, from Vasco de Gama, Mr Barroso, to Goethe, has enlightened. The real challenge of the 21st century is to build the world starting with the shared dimensions of planetary co-ownership, that is to say, the collective management of food – eating – of water – drinking – of medicines – caring for oneself – and of education – acquiring knowledge. Mrs Merkel, you represent the people of Germany; I am the elected representative of the people of wine-growing lands. I raise my glass to you: viel Glück

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the revision of a complex agreement, the Cotonou Agreement, which contains 100 articles, 6 parts, 5 annexes and 5 protocols. This revised agreement contains the whole catalogue of today’s politics, with human rights, democracy, terrorism, arms, the International Criminal Court. All the ACP countries need now is REACH, since they risk being victims of the regulation on chemical products, with losses of income and 315 000 jobs under threat. Metals, alcohol, oils, ammonia, which are exported from 24 major ACP countries, will be hit by REACH, representing a potential loss of income of EUR 6 billion for those countries. That takes us to the real truth about Europe's relations with the ACP countries over the last thirty years. From the Yaoundé agreement of 1963 up to the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, revised in 2005, and the Lomé I, II, III and IV agreements from 1975 onwards, it appears that Europe has been audacious, particularly with the Stabex mechanism, which has protected cocoa, tea, coffee and groundnuts. This demonstrates the spirit of the compensatory inequalities of the CNUCED. Europe has also been generous by means of financial aid from the EDF. Mr Barrot pointed out that there is an allocation of around EUR 25 billion for the 79 ACP countries in the 9th EDF. The reality is different, however. According to the figures, the ACP countries’ share in the Union market has dropped from 6.7% in 1976 to 3% in 1998, and while the GDP of a European increased by an average of 2.3% per year, that of an African from an ACP country, if I dare say it, increased by just 0.6%. In terms of actions too, Europe has forgotten about the ACP countries, just as it has forgotten about the Mediterranean. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Europe has been interested in the East, but no longer in the South. And what is worse, with the WTO, Europe has swallowed up the ACP countries in the world market, as we have seen in the case of sugar and bananas. The multinational banana producer Chiquita has been given preference over Cameroon, which produces bananas, and the Ivory Coast. Ultra-liberal Europe has chosen to make a customs gift of around EUR 2 billion to the multinationals Chiquita, Del Monte and others, rather than to the ACP countries, which have to face the same competition conditions as these multinationals. Cotonou, with its talk of democracy and dialogue, is all very well, but when people have AIDS, human rights are not going to cure them. In other words, rather than being revised, the Cotonou Agreement should be re-worked so as to be audacious in two respects. Firstly, technical audacity through a new customs technology: rather than seeking, within the World Trade Organisation, to reduce, and eventually abolish, customs duties, we must establish a deduction of customs duties in the form of a customs credit deductible on all purchases in the economy of the importing country. This customs credit would be reimbursable, that is to say, it would be higher than the sum of the customs duty paid, for example by the ACP country. With new customs duties that are flexible, reimbursable and negotiable on the world stock market, Europe-ACP relations would be consistent with the necessary free trade and the equally necessary protection of the ACP countries. Secondly, we should show political audacity in a reworked Cotonou Agreement. With globalisation, the challenge of the 21st century consists in organising the common aspects of planetary co-ownership – that is to say, water, food, basic medicines and vaccines and education – all with a resource other than the classic State contribution of the EDF, a fiscal resource such as VAT based on the turnover of telecommunications services provided by space satellites. In this case, we would no longer provide improved assistance in the name of co-development, but we would gradually move towards global land management. That would restore the spirit of Lomé, and we would finally begin to build the world, which is the challenge of the 21st century.

Mr President, the banana is a subject that has given rise to a genuine soap opera since the 1990s. In Europe, we consume bananas originating from three regions: up to around 850 000 tonnes of European bananas originating from the French West Indies, the Canaries and the Azores; bananas from the ACP countries and, finally, ‘dollar’ bananas, grown in Latin America, for the benefit of Chiquita and Dole. Ten years ago, customs duties on the 2.5 million tonnes of US bananas fetched around EUR 850 per tonne; today, they fetch EUR 176. In order words, Europe is giving the US multinationals a gift of EUR 2 billion. Moreover, these bananas are produced in Ecuador by 10-year-old children who are paid USD 2 a day, who inhale pesticides, who have asthma, who have problems with their balance and who suffer from cerebellar ataxia. Elsewhere, working conditions are similar for those who work in the greenhouses used to grow roses. Under these circumstances, an 18-kilo box of bananas can be sold for USD 3 in Germany. That is called slavery. However, it is true that our Parliament also has recourse to a form of slavery when it employs part-session staff members. My God, one more slave will not make any difference!

Madam President, at the beginning of December, NASA announced that a budget had been adopted with a view to the installation of a space station on the Moon in 2020. We, for our part, have a draft budget in 2020 that is designed to allow a train to make the journey from Hendaye in France to Irún in Spain. Thus, the United States have a budget to go to the Moon in a rocket and we, we have a budget to cross the Pyrenees by train! How can we explain this difference? The United States provides itself with a budgetary policy equal to USD 2 500 billion per year, while we, we toy with a budget of EUR 122 billion. We toy with 1 260 amendments, we toy with partnerships at international level, with Europalia, with Daphne, with Plan D – in short, we spread ourselves too thinly. We have only two serious budgetary policies: agricultural policy and regional policy. The remaining budgetary headings, in particular heading 3 'Citizenship', represent a communication budget, for women, young people, consumers, the unemployed, people who have been made redundant, people who have been assaulted … The real cause of this situation is not the lack of own resources: while there is indeed a real standstill, it is due to the ideology of balanced budgets, which prevents exceptional costs from being funded by exceptional resources, that is to say the loan, the loan intended for the major European networks, the rail network, for example. The real budgetary debate, ladies and gentlemen, does not consist in coming out for or against a European tax in 2014, but in coming out for or against a European loan to fund the future of research, of transport, of health care and of education.

Mr President, a codification is a moment of intelligence: one moves away from law to which one is subjected to law that has been thought out. I am therefore very pleased about the reports on customs codification by our fellow Members and friends, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Audy, particularly because, since 1919 in the case of Germany, 1934-35 for France, 1938 for Mexico, and so on, we had lost our codifying ambition. Here, of course – let us not be naïve – we are codifying the customs rules simply because of pressure from the United States after 11 September, who want customs that are no longer to do with budgets but with security: hence the addition of control by authorised economic operator, by customs representatives, and so on. Beyond this little codification, however, we shall have to think of a customs codification that is legally equal to the challenges of globalisation. Since maritime law was codified at Montego Bay in the 1970s, and since International Trade Law was codified at Marrakesh in the 1990s, the 21st century will have to devise a customs codification at the only level appropriate to international trade, that is, at global level. The place for working towards this model of a global code exists: it is the World Customs Organisation in Brussels, in partnership with the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. The sources of inspiration for this model code exist too: it is the Tokyo Convention and the Brussels Convention on customs value and rules of origin. There remains the purpose of this model for a customs code, that is, a revolution in customs technology, so that we can move out of the current archaic system and have customs duties that can be adjusted, reimbursed, subsidised and negotiated. Adjusted according to the production cost differential between one country and another; reimbursed, in the form of a customs credit offered by the importing country to the exporting country; subsidised, in favour of exporting countries of the South, who would receive a customs credit supplement; negotiated, finally, in the stock exchange like the protectionist pollution quotas. In this way we shall at last achieve a reconciliation between international free trade, which is necessary and national social protection, which is equally necessary. This is the marriage of David Ricardo, the free trader, and Friedrich List, the protectionist.

 Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, in this Chamber yesterday we were debating breast cancer, and no one appeared worried about the fight against inflation. That is to say that in situations of life and death our priorities change: we discover what is truly important. However, is the fight against inflation really the most important thing in economic life? Beginning our resolution with a reference to the Father-like status of the independence of the Central Bank, followed by the Son-like status of price stability, in the hope that the Holy Spirit of prosperity will descend from the United States may be good for the independence of the Central Bank, but it is bad for the people. Personally, Mr Trichet, I fully appreciate that you are bound by monetary aggregates one, two and three and by the need for fine-tuning and for steering interest rates. Yet even in the country of Milton Friedman, Chile is left to practise a budgetary surplus of 1%, while the United States itself takes a budgetary overdose. I must therefore conclude by asking the real question: just because our German grandmother had inflationist diabetes in the 1920s, should that mean that, 80 years on, the whole of Europe should go on a sugar-free budgetary and monetary diet?

 Madam President, in France, in practical terms, breast cancer means first of all, at the screening stage, a mammogram, followed by anatomical pathology confirming the presence of cancer. This assessment should be extended to include the liver, the brain and the bones, which are the three areas targeted by metastases. At best, in France, a bone scintigram will be taken; MRI and above all PET scans, used for early metabolic diagnosis, are not performed. During treatment, if patients receive radiotherapy, it will be carried out by a low-ranking technician. As a result, accidental irradiation sometimes occurs around the heart and the thyroid. Finally, after treatment, if, when a patient suffering back pain is examined, a scintigram is taken showing a suspicious shadow on the bone, screening by PET scan will still not be performed. Why? Because in France, for 35 million women, there are only two PET scanners. Why? Because the budgetary austerity pact forbids spending on hospital equipment. As a result, women are dying in Europe due to breast cancer, but also due to the ideological cancer of the European Commission known as budgetary Malthusianism and rampant free-marketism.

Mr President, the European budget is like the theatre of Bertolt Brecht. While ‘Waiting for Godot’ – while waiting for 2014 and own resources – we are managing the most modest of appropriations: EUR 116 billion in payment appropriations, which is not even 1% of gross national income. A game is being played here. For example, the nomenclature has been changed, with a shift from eight headings to six. An attempt has been made at humour: the Europe of 17 million unemployed is referred to under Heading 1 as ‘growth and employment’. The CAP budget, which is destroying farming and fruit and vegetable growing and uprooting 400 000 hectares of land, is referred to under Heading 2 as ‘confirmation of resources’. These changes in form apart, this is a classic budget in every respect. Firstly, it includes a financial framework for 2007-2013, which is contained within an interinstitutional agreement – the fourth of its kind – signed on 17 May. It includes Malthusian sums, for example for agriculture: indeed, market expenditure is going to be wilfully reduced by more than EUR 500 million. It also includes the great classics: EUR 7 billion with which to toy with external policy in the world; EUR 5 billion for a research framework programme that will not research much; and EUR 850 million for the trans-European networks. All of that, while we await the 2008-2009 review during which every issue will be discussed – not only the UK rebate but also, and above all, agriculture and the agricultural budget. The great budget debate will therefore take place between 2010 and 2014. While we wait to discuss the fisheries sector, Erasmus and the citizens, and if we cannot take tea – since it is almost 5 p.m. – we prefer, during this afternoon’s budget debate, to exchange the little budgetary titbits with which our rapporteur has embellished his magnificent report, which is, all the same, very pleasing.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, fellow Members, education, health, postal services, water and transport are at the heart of a society’s life. What is essential to the management of public services designed to benefit the public is a public legal system. It is in Europe that countries like France have invented this cooperative method of administering the shared dimensions of what is owned by society as a whole. This is precisely a time when this intelligent technique for making services generally, indeed universally, available could inspire audacious solutions to worldwide problems in relation to water, basic medicines, education and all the shared dimensions of what is owned by the world as a whole, yet the European Commission is reducing the scope of this tool for guiding human societies, if not actually destroying it. This mess consists in the destruction of what had worked for a century, and behind it is the belief that the market is supreme, that knowledge is its prophet and that all services need to be privatised, as the World Trade Organisation wants to see happen. Such services include those in support of our own sittings – organised by ourselves in the European Parliament as a social squat in which 300 people work without social papers. Mr Barroso, beyond the technical problems explained by our fellow Members, such as Mr Désir who spoke just now, the problem is a cultural problem and a problem of choice. Either we manage human societies according to the law of the market, which is to say the law of the jungle, or we manage them according to the law of reason. Mr Barroso, do you want to continue in this haphazard manner, forever lauding the market while courting the International Monetary Fund one moment and the WTO the next, or do you want to sit down quietly and deal in reasonable terms with problems amenable to reason?

At the Geneva summit in June 2006, Europe showed itself to be flexible until it submitted at the WTO trade negotiations. After having accepted, on 18 December 2005 in Hong Kong, our relinquishing our agricultural export refunds, from 2013 onwards, Mr Mandelson, our Commissioner and chief negotiator, made the magnificent gesture in Geneva of allowing an international agreement to be reached: the reduction of as much as 50% of the customs protection of our agricultural market. Yet, Brazil, which has forthcoming presidential elections, and the United States, which has forthcoming Congressional elections, have not taken the slightest risk: for the United States to reduce its internal aid, and for Brazil to open its industrial market. The negotiations will end up being resumed, but we already know that the Commission has yielded with regard to export subsidies and to the protection of our agriculture and our viticulture against the social dumping of third countries, in which multinationals manufacture goods without there being any labour law or social legislation. The solution for 2007 and for breaking the deadlock is to have the imagination to invent flexible, refundable and discountable customs duties, that is to say, deductible customs duties.

 Mr President, a tsunami is sweeping the European economy and European societies, a giant wave that is known as mental illness but that I prefer to call neurological illness to prevent its being stigmatised. The number of patients is continuously increasing, the wave replenished by the obvious ageing of the population and by the sacred cow of ultraliberal economics, which is itself a form of neurosis. No doubt the European Commission has something to say about this, as does the rapporteur, in paragraph 24, who talks of rural isolation, working conditions, job insecurity and unemployment. What, however, has led to rural isolation if not the destruction of the common agricultural policy, and that in the name of free trade? What has led to unemployment if not the political choice in favour of free trade? What causes stress in the working environment, if not the ideology of competitiveness or competition? What are needed in order to treat these neurological illnesses are what Mr Bowis calls for: hospitals, individual care, specialised services and a variety of health care personnel – in other words, investment, which is something prohibited by the budgetary austerity pact in the name, of course, of the ideology of competitiveness and free trade. That is the point at which we go round in circles because what brings on illness is a mistaken philosophy of economic competition and what is required to treat it is investment, which is something prevented by this same philosophy. Although it may well require an agency responsible for exploring the continent of the mind, the solution probably consists mainly in curing our leaders. I have just one more thing to say. Of Don Quixote of la Mancha it was said that he had read so many books on chivalry that his brain had dried up. In the case of our leaders, they have read so much Adam Smith and David Ricardo that they have gone mad.

 Bearing in mind that the US budget, for one year alone, amounts to USD 2 500 billion, it is obviously untenable for the EU to have, for everyone, a budget of less than EUR 1 000 billion for 2007 to 2013. Initially, and in order to give itself some room for manoeuvre without increasing its budget, the European Commission is gradually eliminating the common agricultural policy and Europe’s small farmers in order to recover most of the EUR 45 billion spent each year on the agricultural budget. Hence, the unlikely position taken by the European negotiators who, at the meeting of the World Trade Organisation on 30 June 2006, accepted, behind the scenes, a 50% reduction in our customs duties, thereby leaving Brazil with a monopoly on food. The basic problem remains intact, however. Everyone knows that, as from 2014, Brussels-centred Europe will be doomed to increase its budget and to create a European tax. Behind the smoke and mirrors, the Lamassoure report’s talk of own resources raises the political issue that has been dragging on since 1951 and that concerns the actual emergence, by way of a single market and then a single currency, of a political state. What the euro did not do and what the Constitution failed to do, because the nations woke up to what was happening, taxation is set to do between 2014 and 2019. Taxpayers have been warned.

Mr President, sustainable development is a nice idea. It has the pleasant aroma of the Norway of Dr Brundtland, who invented it 40 years ago. It is a notion from the good old days, from the Club of Rome, from zero growth. It is a new version of the old idea of Pastor Malthus. At the banquet of humanity, there is not enough room for all of the generations. We must therefore restrict ourselves, because the ice is melting, the water is rising, the greenhouse effect is going to suffocate us, the sun is going to burn out and raw materials are going to run out because the Chinese are consuming everything. In fact, the only thing that is sustainable is under-development. Look at Africa! The only sustainable thing is poverty, which is a socially transmitted disease passed on from generation to generation. Development, on the other hand, is purely provisional. The stone age did not come to an end because of a lack of stones, but because of the invention of bronze. The oil age will also come to an end, not because of a lack of oil, but because we will move on to the age of fusion or of hydrogen. In short, sustainable development is an absurd notion, dreamt up by the rich to explain to the poor that, in order to save humanity in the future, they must go without today.

Mr President, Commissioner, on 13 September 2005, the Court of Justice of the European Communities granted the Community legislator the opportunity to take legal measures so as to guarantee the effectiveness of the rules decreed by the Court. Everyone understood this to mean – at any rate, those in Vienna understood it to mean – that the Court had turned the principle of subsidiarity inside out like a sock in order to decide that, on the subject of Community law, there was no point in the Member States taking care to ensure that it was complied with since the Commission of Brussels was able to do so all by itself. The Commission has obviously not failed to step into this breach: while, strictly speaking, this new legal power only concerns the environment, a Commission communication of November 2005 makes more widespread use of this power to incorporate other subjects, including the four freedoms, the CAP and fishing. Mr Cavada, our draftsman, even extends this power to include discriminatory behaviour, which can cover all human activities and even the protection of the Union’s financial interests. It is here that one can see the danger of this umpteenth show of strength by the judges of Luxembourg. On 6 April 2006, scarcely two months ago, in fact, the European Court of First Instance ordered Mr Frattini – the Commission – to pay damages and interest to an official on the grounds of a serious and obvious violation of the requirement for impartiality. Violation by whom? By OLAF, that is to say by the anti-fraud office, which is partly controlled by the Commission. Thus, to grant legal powers to this Commission, on the subject of which the Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 1 of 2005, notes that respect for the fundamental rights of persons subject to an inquiry is not guaranteed, means running the risk of creating, at the Berlaymont, a little centre in which people’s liberties are infringed, a kind of regulatory mini-Guantanamo. The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Cavada, is, moreover, aware of the problem since he is calling for the judgment to be applied with prudence and he might have added: with jurisprudence, the prudence of the law and, in particular, of the law of the Treaties, which does not permit the powers of the third pillar to be transferred to the first pillar. However, since 1962 and its Costa versus ENEL judgment, the Court has been imprudently and continuously carrying out a federal coup d’état
. As the great British legal expert, Dicey, said: judges must be lions, but lions under the throne, being circumspect that they do not check or oppose any points of sovereignty. Putting someone in prison is a matter for criminal law. It is not a trivial matter.

A free trade area is an area without barriers, customs barriers in particular. It is a common market, almost like that of Europe. The transatlantic free trade area, therefore, is a common market from Warsaw to San Francisco, from Helsinki to Patagonia and from Malta to the Canadian Great North. While European public opinion imagines that the political debate is about the future of the European Constitution, the reality is quite simply, from 2010 to 2015, that is to say in five years, the building of a political and economic body made up of 45 nations out of the 193 that there are in the world. On the quiet, Mrs Mann’s report signals a transition from European integration to a political integration comprising one quarter of the world. This would mean a Parliament of 45 nations, a common trade tribunal and the beginnings of a common legislation. After 90 years Paul Valéry’s prediction that ‘Europe aspires to be run by an American committee’ is coming true. Farewell Europe, hello World! Mrs Mann has made a double announcement: the death of the European idea and the birth of a world organisation.

 It is a good thing to want to monitor nutrition claims in order to prevent the purveyors of cholesterol and diabetes from selling their highly sweetened drinks and high-fat food under cover of excessive claims concerning the energy they provide. It is, however, unacceptable to do as the Commissioner did yesterday and also to target wine in one’s efforts to promote health and to combat obesity and alcoholism. Wine is emphatically not a form of alcohol manufactured through industrial processes but a drink produced through the natural fermentation of fresh grapes. In Europe, wine is not water plus chemicals plus flavourings, as it is in the self-styled wineries of California or Australia, but a food produced from fermented grapes. It must, then, be possible to say so. It must be possible to make claims about the nutritional and health benefits of wine, with its antioxidants. Otherwise, what is the explanation for the fact that the geographical area covered by vineyards is also the area in which civilisation has taken root, while the geographical area covered by the health-obsessed, eugenically inclined Nordic countries is also the home of drunkenness, skinheads and cyclical depression, a place where not a single cultural miracle of any significance has taken place?

 Mr President, Commissioner, on the motorway between Istanbul and Sofia, there is a border post or toll-gate called Kapitan Andreevo. Remember that name because it is going to appear in all the newspapers as from 1 January if Bulgaria joins the European Union. Indeed, that is where, every year, 300 000 lorries arrive from Turkey. The queue is five kilometres long, and the lorries wait for three days. They are used for criminal trafficking in all its forms: drug-trafficking from Afghanistan, human trafficking from Pakistan and trading in amphetamines and forged currency. To monitor all this, there is one customs official per thousand lorries. As a result, everything gets through. There is an obvious need for at least one cargo scanner. Mr Rehn told us in this House on 25 October that radiographic equipment was indeed necessary, and EUR 8 million was paid out for this purpose. Yet there is no scanner. The fact is that everyone who liked Sangatte, Brindisi, Almeria and the Canaries is going to love Kapitan Andreevo, the gate for entering Europe from Asia and the focal point from which criminality will spread far and wide.

Since the species migrates three times over - in the Atlantic, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, for example, and from the sea to the river - the fate of eels clearly serves to remind us that the world is interdependent, especially when the sudden rise in demand from the East encourages fishing in Europe. That being said, the everyday reality for eels is one of being caught by locals, for example in pools on the edge of the Mediterranean in the South of France. There, hundreds of fishermen make their living from that activity. To ban them from fishing for two weeks a month, while booms, cormorants, power stations and oceanic disturbances place a strain on the life cycle of eels, is unjust and ineffective, and that is where subsidiarity must come into play. Let us leave it to the fishermens’ prud'homies
 - the professional organisations - to look into the fate of eels more closely. The survival of eels does not depend on Community federalism, but on the action of local professional organisations.

Mr President, I welcome this agreement, which is reasonable on two grounds. Firstly, it is reasonable as far as the fishery resources in the Moroccan provinces of Western Sahara are concerned. It is not the opinion of Parliament’s legal service that counts, but that of the International Court of Justice. For centuries, Morocco has exercised a certain form of sovereignty over that territory. If Algeria wants an outlet into the Atlantic, that is its problem, but that is not a good enough reason to invent laws. It is also reasonable because it is good to retain the benefits derived from these agreements and to transfer them to the Saharan provinces of Morocco and to the people. I have just one reservation, however: it concerns the annual 60 000 tonnes of industrial fishing granted to the large seiners of Northern Europe, which have no historic precedence, especially not in comparison with the historic precedence of Morocco, which nonetheless authorised the presence in its waters of 244 vessels, which disappeared at the end of the agreement. Since the agreement with Angola has been denounced, we must take delight in the fact that we have concluded this reasonable and balanced agreement with Morocco. Let us not pick a quarrel with the Moroccans.

Latin America was heralded as the giant power for the end of the 20th century. Sixty years later, ultraliberal policies, institutional shortcomings and the difficult relationship with the neighbouring United States have had consequences that can be observed in the Andes or the favelas of Rio. Yet, Latin America is rich in every respect, starting with its inhabitants, who have a powerful culture. Europe cannot, therefore, fail to take an interest in it. We must therefore give ‘power to the imagination’ in European-Latin American relations, because the correct model of relations lies between ‘Christlike cosmopolitanism’ and ‘Westphalian cosmopolitanism’. This median point between diplomatic Plato and Machiavelli is located in a ‘four-square model of humanitarianism’. Europe must propose that resources are shared between the two shores of the Latin world: water, food, education and medicines. An economic security Council must be added to the Euro-Atlantic Assembly, which was proposed by the Bregenz summit on 25 April 2006. Funded by a form of VAT on the numerous services provided, from space and geostationary satellites, this Council would make a success of partnerships aimed at supplying water and providing basic medicines, education and food. This four-square model at the core of humanitarianism would prevent Ecuador from pouring into Spain and children in Latin America from being reduced to donating their organs for the commercial trafficking of insane capitalism.

Responding to the linguistic standardisation of Europe, whereby English is the popular phonetic soup, with a form of multilingualism that the European Union would do well to practice itself, is all well and good. The French, who listen to Mr Trichet speaking in the European Parliament in English, and the Germans who, despite representing 30% of the people of the Union, see their language's share of the European language market reduced to 14%, can only approve of the sanctioning of multilingualism. It is not Europe’s job to help destroy linguistic biodiversity. From that perspective, the Catalans make some sensible observations. The Catalan language which, with more than 15 million speakers, is used more widely that Finnish, Danish, Latvian or even Dutch, cannot be overlooked in the European Parliament. The Catalan, Occitan or Breton languages represent the rootlets of France's cultural tree. The same could be said of the tree representing Spain’s identity. Faced with the winds of Anglo-Saxon globalisation, these national trees need all of their deep cultural roots in order to remain standing. It is true that, if it were not for the fact that multilingualism is a necessity, in a few years time, we, the French MEPs in the European Parliament, would be calling for the right of our minority to speak our regional language.

 Ukraine had an Orange Revolution but life there remained grey. Moscow had a White Revolution and the result is clear to see: a fall of 10 years in life expectancy, a declining population, crime, destruction of the healthcare systems and pillaging of the country's assets for the benefit of the oligarchs. Just one more push and the crimes of liberalism will equal the crimes of communism. We must not deprive Belarus of all the delights generated by the market. Belarusians too are entitled to the freedom of the media/military/political oligarchy, with its entourage of unemployment, passive euthanasia of the elderly, cultural degradation, economic stagnation, brutal individualism and social isolation. It is quite understandable that the European Parliament is delighted with the media-political democracy of the magnates Messrs Berlusconi, Bouygues, Lagardère and Murdoch. Belarus too has a right to national liberal destitution and to degenerate, media-led democracy.

Mr President, with regard to the finding, we all agreed that this sum of around EUR 1 000 billion, which is meant to provide for seven years of the European budget, is a modest one, when the US budget, for one year alone, is USD 2 500 billion. Under these circumstances, the claim made in Lisbon that, in 2010, Europe will be the most competitive economy on the planet is akin to the behaviour of Nikita Khrushchev who, in 1960, at the United Nations, said, ‘In ten years’ time, the Soviet Union will have caught up with the United States’. Thus, from this perspective, and notwithstanding our successful attempt to secure a fistful of some thousands of extra euros, the proposals that we make in this Chamber remain just as unsuitable in the face of the universally recognised need for investment in laboratories, hospitals, universities, retirement homes, high-speed train services and so on. This means that the Council and Parliament only differed over an extra ‘nought point something’ in relation to GDP, because they draw their inspiration from the same source, which can be summed up in two words: Malthusianism in terms of economic policy and fundamentalism in terms of budgetary policy. Malthusianism is everywhere in the Union and in the CAP, regarding quotas, set-aside and the uprooting of vines. The European Parliament, in this very Chamber, inflicts poverty on its catering staff and its drivers, who earn the shameful sum of EUR 1 000 per month! This is an example of the sordid economic reality that is reflected in the fundamentalism of our budgetary policies and in the budgetary technique of the Union’s Financial Regulation. Everything is done to avoid spending! The Union’s Financial Regulation lays down the principle of budgetary balance. Mr Barroso, you need to go back to the days of Dr Salazar in order to find that principle, when the United States, in 100 years, has only had 38 balanced budgets. In other words, if our plan was to revise our financial perspective, then we should have revised the ultraliberal ideology underpinning it, but to question the three scourges of Anglo-Saxon thinking – Malthus, Adam Smith and Ricardo – was quite another matter.

Mr President, Commissioner, everyone in this Chamber is in favour of free trade; no one wants to re-create the Albania of Enver Hoxha’s time. We are therefore all in favour of multilateral rules, but which rules, and to benefit whom? We are told that free trade benefits employment and growth. Yet, have the rules applied to trade until now made nations wealthy? Here is the answer: in Mexico, 94 free trade agreements have been signed and they have not brought about prosperity; in Ecuador, the indigenous people of the Andes are against the free trade agreement; currently, in France, three million secondary school students are demonstrating because there are no jobs; and, where I live, the wine growers are poverty-stricken, people are committing suicide and yet there is free trade. The observation demonstrating that the current free trade rules do not lead to economic prosperity indicates two possibilities. The first possibility is that free trade is the secular name for Christianity, whereby the wine growers of Europe, the small farmers and the workers must climb onto the Cross in order to atone for their worldly sins. In that case, let us continue and, in exchange for our concessions, Brazil and India will not open up their markets, and the Anglo-Saxon world will not recognise our intellectual property rights in relation to our agricultural designations. Thus, Commissioner, we are persevering on the poverty path which, after ten rounds of GATT and WTO negotiations, has done nothing for Africa. The other possibility is that, finally, we stop making mistakes and follow the path of subscribing not to the archaic technique of reducing or abolishing customs duties, but to the modern technique of deducting customs duties. We will make the technological leap by inventing deductible customs duties because, in the form of tax credits that are offered to exporting countries and that can be used in the importing country, we shall have customs duties that ensure economic neutrality, and we shall resolve the tragedies brought about by globalisation. Tell Mr Mandelson that his role is not that of following in the footsteps of David Ricardo, but of having John Maynard Keynes’ capacity for invention.

 From China to Europe, passing through Russia, not to mention Africa, a huge demographic problem is emerging. The world is growing older. What is worse, in some countries of Europe, the population is declining or is going to decline, as in Germany or Russia. The demographic consequences are well-known: increases in expenditure on health and pensions, the need for millions of jobs providing personal care and a shortage of staff resulting in a migration influx, which has the psychological effect of pushing societies towards cautious, do nothing attitudes and Malthusian ‘no future’ policies, of which the ‘austerity budget pact’ has been the expression since Maastricht. In other words, who is going to pay the taxes to finance this situation? The Gods of the stadium or old people on their last legs? Of course, family policies will endeavour to create contributors and contributions. While we wait, however, for the increase in the birth rate and, hence, new workers, in the vacuum of the next 20 years unfolding before us, the Belgian, Dutch or Swiss laws on euthanasia, dressed up as the right to choose one’s own death, demonstrate the ‘Journey to the End of the Night’ that the policies, especially in Europe, have begun.

Inspired by the French AOC, the European legal tool for the protection of our agricultural products, with labels such as PGI, is at the very heart of the agricultural conflict between Europe and the Anglo-Saxon countries. For the United States, agriculture has to be industrial, with logos and brand names, wine included. For Europe, agriculture is primarily a quality, family-run concern with land whose produce is protected in its geographical origin. Symbolic of this is wine, born of fermentation and a sign of civilisation, while in Australia it is an industrial commodity. At the WTO the conflict between the United States and Europe, the southern hemisphere and Europe, the Anglo-Saxon world and Europe, is a real clash of civilisations between the sickle and McDonalds. In Hong Kong, however, the Commission did not even bring up the matter of the multilateral register for labels of origin to protect our small farmers’ wines in competition with big wine merchants. In Geneva, at the end of April, to continue to reduce agricultural tariff protection and to allow the dumping of 1.2 million tonnes of meat from the southern hemisphere and those Australian liquids, factory-coloured, wooded, fruited, sweetened and called wines, is to destroy our agricultural identity of which the PGIs are a tool.

A Financial Regulation is the same thing as a financial constitution. It is therefore important. We must reform this regulation, which is jamming Europe’s bureaucratic machinery, because it is the benchmark or expression of Europe’s pathologically proliferating bureaucracy. If bulky manuals are needed in order to understand this Regulation, if a ‘helpdesk’ is needed to come to the daily rescue of those officials who are lost in the maze of its procedures and if businesses, institutes, organisations, small farmers and Europeans cannot take advantage of all of the subsidies or participate in all of the markets, then it is quite simply because the Financial Regulation is based on the fundamental philosophical principle running throughout European integration: the smoke and mirrors principle which, in 1905, the Italian financier Puviani called the financial illusions principle and which consists of using complexity to hide the truth – the European truth in this case.

 Creating a single market between 25 States with very different labour, social and fiscal costs was bound to lead to the relocation of businesses to the countries with lower production costs, and that is indeed what has happened. The ten new Member States are attracting businesses from 'old Europe' and even US businesses based in Mexico. It is particularly shocking that these countries are providing an attractive tax climate, and then getting their sanitary, social, road network and other improvements paid for by the western countries, which, by increasing their taxes to pay for the ten new countries, are worsening their own production problems. For relocations outside the EU, there is a basic solution. We need to invent customs duties using new technologies with three characteristics. They must be variable according to the difference in costs between the two countries in question. They must be reimbursable, with the customs duty paid by the exporter becoming a 'tax credit' deductible from purchases from the importer's economy. In other words, the customs duty would give the exporter a drawing right on the importer's economy, which is a win-win situation for international trade. Finally, they must be redeemable when the importer wants to grant a benefit to the exporter. The customs credit would thus become a matching credit of the kind already in existence in international tax law.

For 50 years, the freedom to provide cross-border services has featured among the four fundamental freedoms of the common market. That is what the Court of Justice confirmed by recognising a COP, a country of origin principle. For the blind among us, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, signed in Marrakech in April 1994, laid down, throughout the world, a ‘fourth mode’ of service provision, in the form of a cross-border provision of services, that is to say of a temporary switch to the social dumping conditions of the country of origin. It is this old principle that the leaders of Europe are now pretending to discover, whereas this COP has been devastating European economies for decades. Seeking to maintain the French-influenced European social model, with its pensions, its health protection, its free schools, its post offices, its trains and its hospitals, demands that we not only oppose workers being paid the lowest possible wages, as practised in the most socially backward countries, but that we also oppose the idea of a market without customs protection, which is the real cause of social dumping. The rule of the COP is only one symptom of this social dumping. The starting point – the first rogue cell – of this social cancer is the idea of the single market, without the protection of customs duties. The country of origin rule is nothing other than a secondary cancer.

Is it possible to have rural development without country people? Will there be any villages and landscapes in the wine-growing South of France if our vines are uprooted, if our cooperative and private wine cellars are made to shut down and if the winegrowers’ farmhouses are replaced by housing estates? Will the rural development of the south west and of the Périgord, Cévennes and Causses regions come about through the disappearance of farmers, shepherds and flocks of sheep, with only senior citizens from Great Britain, the Netherlands and northern Europe to replace them? Rural development in the second pillar is just a smoke screen. It is the fancy name used to describe the disappearance of our agricultural production to the benefit of producers from Brazil, Australia or the South Pacific, with the consolation prize of modest jobs as landscape gardeners for the surviving members of France’s and Europe’s farming communities. Rural development is just as hypocritical a concept as ‘multifunctional agriculture’. It is a pain reliever, a palliative remedy applied to women and men from the countryside, who are knowingly and disgracefully sacrificed to the all-important ‘global deal’. In the South Pacific, the focus is on agriculture; in Europe, the focus is on the illusory services market. Having stupidly ‘sold out’ its farmers, Europe goes and invents a pharisaic ‘rural development’ policy in the human and economic desert that Brussels has created in our countryside.

It is about time we had a forestry strategy, particularly in a France which, in the 21st century, was able to create one of Europe’s most beautiful forests, in the Landes region, and which has since been unable to manage its forest commercially. When we see our forests destroyed by fire in Portugal, France and Spain and when we depend on Indonesia and Brazil for our industrial wood or our paper fibres, while all the time bemoaning deforestation and its associated climatic and biological disasters, we are reminded just how necessary the global political reaction is. What is required is a willingness to create a major wood sector in Europe and, more specifically, in France. To do this, preferred investments, trained and non-disadvantaged professionals, a long-term political vision and an intelligent approach to taxation are required.

Mr President, I should like simply to draw our fellow Members’ attention to the dreadful and tragic situation of the wine growers from southern Europe and, more specifically, from the Languedoc-Roussillon region, thousands – tens of thousands – of whom will take to the streets in the large cities of southern France this Wednesday in order to voice their distress. A wine grower’s annual turnover is EUR 20 000. His fixed costs come to EUR 15 000, which leaves him with EUR 5 000 on which to live throughout the entire year. We know what is behind this tragic situation: unreasonable free trade agreements, like the ones concluded as recently as November 2005 with the United States, South Africa and so on, that is to say with countries in which the climate and the environmental, social and fiscal conditions are different to our own. This is therefore unfair competition. Thank you, Mr President, for having taken note of the tragic situation of the wine growers, including those from Spain, Italy, Greece and France.

Madam President, we are all clearly in favour of protecting chickens kept for meat production from the barbarity in the concentration camp-style farms. Many a time in this very Chamber have I denounced the disgraceful industrial farms, in which up to 80 million male chicks have been burnt alive to heat up the farms. I have denounced the way in which the chickens are slaughtered using electric stunning techniques. In fact, the chickens are not completely stunned, with the result that they are plunged into hot water while they are still alive: they are boiled so that they can be plucked. We therefore all agree that rules are needed. However, when European farmers read the directive, what do they see? They see that the broiler chicken is subjected to two daily medical visits, which are carried out by a veterinary surgeon who must be at least three metres away from the chicken; the area in which the chickens are kept must be illuminated by a non-flickering light with an intensity of 50 lux, 20 lux or 100 lux – no one quite knows – measured at bird eye level; the inside temperature of the farm must not exceed the outside temperature measured in the shade by more than 3˚C; the chicken’s litter must be 5 cm deep; certificates are required for the purposes of keeping chickens and of castrating chicks that are less than ten days’ old; the chickens’ foot pads must be examined, and the stocking density of the chickens must be limited to 28, 30, 35 or 42 kilograms per square metre, although it is not specified whether this means one kilo liveweight or metabolic weight. Meanwhile, thousands of chickens are being slaughtered in Nigeria, and avian influenza is going to strike down 1.1 billion African chickens. All of this because we did not find the EUR 800 million that would have made it possible to administer to each African chicken the two necessary vaccines, at a cost of 40 cents per dose. I could also try to add a touch of black humour here. Faced with this deluge of precautions that are reserved for white chickens while black children are dying of leprosy, AIDS and tuberculosis, the little African child is going to end up saying: ‘when I grow up, I am not going to be a fireman, I am going to be a broiler chicken in Europe! In the meantime, our Breton farms, for example, are relocating to Brazil – the leader in poultry farming – where not only are the chickens unprotected, but the children are too. The latter are treated like slaves so that the Brazilian farms can be kept in operation, and that is without mentioning the banana plantations, in which little eight-year-olds fall asleep exhausted on cardboard boxes and come into contact with plant-care products that make them dizzy, all for just USD 2 a day. Well, everyone has his or her own idea of what is most important. Some people choose white chickens whereas I, for my part, choose African children and Asian children. That is where foolishness leads you when you try to act virtuously and, with this directive, we are acting stupidly.

 This report comes from a pen of considerable scientific authority in parliamentary law, and it is clear from reading it that he has used the great authorities in the discipline, such as Eugène Pierre. It is based on a philosophical choice: the choice of oligarchy, in other words, in the language of Aristotle, 'the rule of a few'. Thus, thirty or so MEPs (session presidents, and those who impose penalties, hear those penalised and confirm the penalties) will be responsible for supervising their colleagues. As all Members owe their position to sovereignty, be it popular or national, it is sovereignty itself that will find itself under supervision. France invented parliamentary sovereignty back in 1791, supplanting popular sovereignty. However, as Parliament, by virtue of its composition, represented only one social class – the bourgeoisie and the other so-called liberal professions – it seized popular or national sovereignty for its own benefit. In this report, this little band of oligarchs is setting up instruments to neutralise any representatives of the people who might get through the electoral and media filters. Consequently, this report, which should have restricted itself to a single word – 'freedom' of the people's representatives – can be summed up with a different word: oligarchy.

 The Commission's philosophy is Malthusian; its slogan is 'No future'. It takes its inspiration from nihilism. Destroy: destroy the coalmines, the steelworks, the textile industry and, above all, agriculture. We have arable land: they leave it fallow. We have milk: they impose quotas. We have vineyards: they tear them down. But all of that was not enough to kill us off, so they overhauled the common agricultural policy. They invented decoupling – in other words, being paid for not producing anything – because that is their philosophy: do not create. They have just one ideal: a vast continental retirement home, fed by mass redundancies. The overhaul of the common organisation of the market for sugar is a perfect example of this ideology. We have sugar refineries: the Commission is going to pay them not to produce anything. For every tonne of sugar they do not produce, they will be paid EUR 400, 500 or 600. For four years. After that, there will be no producers left, just consumers who have no means to consume, and it will only remain for them to be eliminated. Long live death! That was the rallying cry of the Brahmans.

 The tidal wave of ultraliberalism and unbridled free trade had, for 20 years, been breaking destructively over our coalmines and steelworks and over those industries of ours whose products included textiles, leather, machine tools, electrical goods and motor vehicles. It laid waste our fishing ports, our farms - including our sheep, cattle and poultry farms - our vineyards in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, our banana plantations in the West Indies and our plantations in Réunion, leaving women and men, including our countries’ workers of both sexes, suddenly without social protection. When the wave finally came to grief, it was in its encounter with the will of the French people, expressed in the referendum of 29 May 2005. The people do not want to see our forms of social protection dismantled any further. Nor do they want any longer to see preference given to the base exploitation of foreign ‘workers’ by the Bolkestein directive and its younger sister, the Directive on Port Services. This Wednesday, 18 January 2006, the Front National’s MEPs have secured a parliamentary majority for refusing, for the second time, to allow European dockworkers, port pilots or any of our personnel responsible for stowage and other dock work to be sacrificed in Europe for the sole benefit of the multinationals that hold sway over maritime freight.

 We approve of the desire to replace the 1993 directive in a way that improves and standardises conditions of slaughter throughout the European Union. We also approve of the principle according to which animals should only be slaughtered using methods which ensure instant death or death after stunning, but we are totally against the idea of permitting exemptions in the framework of religious rites. Public opinion is very sensitive and completely opposed to unnecessary, painful practices. Why tolerate them, then, in the name of religion, irrespective of whether or not the animals are immobilised prior to being killed? Strict legislation that provides for verification of the procedures must be introduced to ensure that animals are stunned and cannot regain consciousness before dying, but it would be even better to prohibit such practices completely. They are from another age and can be rightly termed barbaric.

It was time for the partners concerned to consider the welfare of animals used for research purposes and the ban on trapping wild monkeys for use by breeding farms, which results in violence; stress during capture, then confinement; the separation of family groups; the splitting up of social groups; an impact on the environment; the disturbance of the natural balance of the population; and the withdrawal of females. We will therefore support the aim of making maximum use of animals bred for this purpose whose genetic and medical history are known, and who therefore offer greater consistency and comparability of data. If, on the other hand, the animal welfare standards used for research purposes resulted in the exporting of research, the impact would then be more obvious in those countries which already operate under strict regulatory controls, such as Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The fact is, in those countries the pharmaceutical industry has continued to prosper despite 20 years of strict regulation. Regulation has not, therefore, curbed the success of this industry. The controls have even improved the standards of scientific practices. This therefore confirms the fear of seeing research exported in the wake of these regulations.

Mr President, on 2 July 2008, the Commission presented a draft directive on the application of patients’ rights in cases of cross-border care, in an effort to overcome the existing barriers. This issue is a priority for all Member States. However, not all have the resources to guarantee a given level of quality and safety to patients, whether at the care level or even at the level of the professional quality of practitioners. It therefore seems necessary to specify the responsibilities of the Member States in this area. Faced with the diverse methods of organising care systems in the Union, we must not lose sight of the fact that health must remain an essentially national competence, and that every State is free to define its own health policy. However, taking into account the mobility of European workers – although this accounts for only 3% to 4% of citizens and slightly less than EUR 10 billion a year – many uncertainties remain about the quality and safety of care, patients’ rights, data protection and means of redress in the case of harm. However, we are unfortunately heading towards an inevitable downwards harmonisation, and it is in this respect that we will remain extremely vigilant in our support for this report, in order better to defend our fellow citizens’ social acquis

 Since the introduction of nanoparticles in cosmetic products, as well as the fact that the cosmetics sector features among the biggest victims of industrial counterfeiting, it is important to have clear means of control, particularly for identifying counterfeit cosmetics, which do not therefore meet legal requirements. Some products in fact warrant particular attention, especially cosmetics used around the eyes, on the mucous membrane, on damaged skin, for children or those with a weakened immune system. Clearly a particular focus is needed on local toxicity evaluation, skin and eye irritation, skin sensitisation, and photo-induced toxicity in the case of UV absorption. In addition, the fight against counterfeiting using these controls is vital for public health and environmental impact, but also for competitiveness. We therefore support this report, but new tests should not be performed on finished products if known information on the ingredients they contain proves compliant with legislation.

Of course we shall support this courageous report, which attacks outmoded practices – practices which are spreading across Europe as a result of immigration. Following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, it is no longer acceptable for such practices to be able to persist in Europe and across the world. According to data collated by the World Health Organization, between 100 and 140 million women and young girls in the world have been subjected to genital mutilation and, every year, 2 to 3 million women face the risk of suffering these seriously incapacitating practices. We must not forget that such practices originate in social structures based on inequality of the sexes and on unbalanced power relations of domination and control under social and family pressure, and that this amounts to a violation of fundamental rights and causes grave and irreversible damage. We must wholly condemn and punish these practices. Immigrant populations must comply with our legislation and our respect for the individual and not bring with them these unacceptable and barbaric practices.

 Mr President, although the Animal Transport Regulation has been in force since January 2007, Member States do not appear to be systematically complying with this regulation, since they are failing to submit the annual reports requested. A comprehensive analysis is therefore problematic since a large amount of the necessary information with regard to the resources allocated for the undertaking of inspections is missing. As a member of animal welfare associations and the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I am particularly interested in this issue. Associations fought relentlessly for decades up until 2007 when directives were finally established in this area in which Member States can now be seen to be displaying a certain degree of laxity. I would even go so far as to say unwillingness because in short, as we know, carrying out checks and inspections is not all that difficult. We know where the abattoirs are, we know where the animals are reared, and we know the routes along which the animals are transported, so where is the problem? I think that it is important, in this day and age when the public are quite rightly taking a growing interest in animal welfare on the farm, at the slaughterhouse and during transport, that Member States respect these views. Since I have been given the opportunity to speak, I should like to add that, with regard to transport, irrespective of the length of journeys made, it is essential that local climate conditions are taken into consideration. A journey lasting several hours made in the Netherlands in spring is very different from a journey of the same length made in the middle of summer in a country such as Greece. Should we not make night-time transport obligatory in the latter case? I should be grateful if you would consider this proposal in the future.

 We have had the opportunity to state several times here that the simple aim of reducing the European Union’s dependence on gas or oil imports could, in itself, justify the promotion of renewable energy sources. The compromise presented here today, which forms part of the energy and climate change package, is like all compromises: neither all bad, nor entirely satisfactory. In particular, it is not entirely satisfactory with regard to biofuels, whether second-generation or not. There is an inadequate guarantee with regard to competition with food production, vagueness with regard to any changes to land use, silence on the actual carbon footprint of these energy sources, and so on. It is not entirely convincing with regard to the ‘guarantee of origin’, intended to identify green electricity in particular, when we are aware of the reality of electricity supply, dubious advertisements on the subject and the significant additional cost for consumers. Lastly, it is absolutely unsatisfactory in terms of the social consequences. We would like to be certain, as we would, for that matter, for this whole legislative package, adopted at the start of a global crisis that promises to be profound and long-lasting, that the interests of European citizens and workers will take precedence over any other consideration, should the economic situation so require.

 The European Parliament must think that its Members are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease! Every year, at about the same time, two different reports appear: one on human rights in the EU and the other on equality between men and women. Though the content of the first can vary slightly from one year to the next, quite clearly the same is not true of the second. To believe this, all you need to do is read the previous ones: the Kauppi report in 2007 or the Estrela report in 2006 on equality between men and women. They list the same challenges to be met, report the existence of the same inequalities and make the same recommendations. Do we conclude that there has been no change? No, because progress has been made with employment and with the participation of women in decision-making at local, national and European level. It is just that we Eurocrats, spurred on by the women’s lobbies – and I am thinking particularly of the powerful European Women’s Lobby – are not satisfied with the progress; they want and are advocating even greater equality, even greater similarity between women and men, to the point of absurdity. Do we have to go along with this forced equality obtained through compulsory, discriminatory and minority-focused quotas? I do not believe so. The battle of the sexes does not have to take place.

Obviously the real aim of this third energy package is not security of supply, the quality of the services being provided, price affordability or the ability of consumers freely to choose their supplier but rather the permanent dismantling of what is left of the old public electricity monopolies. The determination being displayed by the Commission and by many Members of this House in wanting to impose ‘patrimonial separation’, in other words forcing ‘historical’ operators like EDF to give up ownership of their network, is quite unacceptable. The activities these companies are being accused of, namely restricting competitors’ access to the network and deliberately limiting investment in infrastructure projects, have never in fact been proven. Neither is it clear how entrusting control of the network to a single operator that is not the electricity supplier can guarantee an appropriate and adequate level of investment, non-abuse of a key position or better congestion management. This is why, though we have always defended the exclusive primacy of Member States over energy affairs, which is a strategic area of too great importance to be left to the Eurocrats, we will be supporting as the lesser of two evils the ‘effective separation’ solution being proposed by, among others, France and Germany. We shall also vote against those texts whose viewpoints we fundamentally reject.

Distorted truths, erroneous statements and sexist remarks primarily stigmatising men represent, in a few words, a few brutal words, the substance of this report. Equality between men and women and better integration of women in professional careers cannot be conceived in an authoritarian and repressive fashion. This can only make the results negative and counterproductive. It is certainly true that delays in terms of integration, wage gaps or a lack of career profiles are legion for women, particularly in the field of science and research. Once again, however, it is dialogue, implementation of non-restrictive measures to encourage girls to study science long term, and active support for women throughout their careers that will finally move them forward in society.

 There are currently no less than five directives on equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the European Union. Twenty-eight actions for infringement are in progress against Member States that have not transposed them. This can only be deplored. Nevertheless, should we systematically impose gender equality by force and through repression? I do not think so, quite the contrary. Let us stop stigmatising this discourse on discrimination by classifying minority groups and populations as ‘good’, in particular immigrants, and making Europeans feel guilty as if they were constantly practising discrimination. We need to put an end to these leftist refrains that do not do anything to help people who are being discriminated against, who are on the contrary stigmatised by them. Let us place more emphasis on each person’s personal responsibility to end discrimination of any kind and on the need, especially for immigrants, to adapt to our rules, our laws and our values.

It will have taken eleven years of painful indecision and political and administrative disagreements to arrive at a solution for the creation of a European satellite radionavigation system. The delay resulting from the method chosen – including Public-Private Partnership, international cooperation outside the European Union, essential participation by all Member States, prescribed role of the European Commission – is estimated at five years. If those principles and methods had been applied to technological and industrial ventures such as Airbus and Ariane, Europe would probably not have its own aircraft manufacturer or space launcher today. Although the end result is not entirely satisfactory, there are many lessons to be learnt from it. Large strategic projects can only be launched in new areas, where the private sector is unable or unwilling to take risks, if the public authorities are the sole decision-makers and financiers, because these are projects that involve political vision and not simply economic logic. Secondly, in projects of this kind, the fact that they had to go through Community institutions and procedures proved a hindrance and a negative factor, adding to the ideological constraints, where intergovernmental cooperation turned out to be effective. Let us hope those lessons will be taken to heart.

The situation of women in rural areas has been discussed many times at numerous international conferences on women (1975, 1980, 1985 and 1995) on agricultural reform and rural development (1979) and on population (1994), and also by the European Commission and Parliament. The accumulation of texts, however, is rather pointless since the observations are always the same: an increase in the ‘masculinisation’ of the rural population and no improvement in the status of spouses assisting with agricultural operations. It is high time strategies were developed to curb the exodus of women from rural areas, particularly women with qualifications. It is also time to take account of the development of the broad guidelines worldwide, particularly the removals of controls on trade and finance, and the privatisation of agriculture in a strictly regulated and quota-ridden commercial sector. Times are changing, but not so the mindsets and customs that all too often prefer the role of women in agriculture to be mere co-operators or unpaid employees, frequently working in strictly family businesses. The report proposes changes to this status and we will thus vote in favour of it.

Mr President, on reading this report one might be tempted to say ‘All quiet on the western front’: nothing new, in other words. The panorama is always the same: the persistence of stereotypes in the choice of educational and professional guidelines, over-representation of women in certain sectors such as the textile industry, the pay gap, working conditions and career prospects. The recommendations never change, however: promoting equality between men and women in professional spheres in terms of pay, their presence on company boards, or developing structures for child care and employment flexibility. This is fine, but what then? What exactly is this umpteenth report on women’s rights going to change, within or outside the industrial sector? Despite coercive policies based on ‘positive action’ – a misleading formulation, since what it really means is compulsory quotas – gender mindsets have great difficulty moving forward. It is not by imposing structures that may occasionally be unnatural, in the name of the principles of equality and non-discrimination, that women will more naturally take up their role within companies, whatever they may be. Women do not have such a severe handicap that they must be systematically imposed to be accepted. Incentive measures must not be coercion measures. Moreover, when applying the Charter of Fundamental Rights we should not forget that we must also leave all entrepreneurs free to hire whomever they choose, as long as all employees are treated in the same manner, regardless of their sex.

 This report has the great merit of clearly defining the rights of the child, but above all of condemning almost exhaustively the dangers children are exposed to: from exposure at an early age to depictions of horror, pornography and violence in the media to honour crimes, forced marriages and genital mutilation on cultural or religious grounds. Without actually mentioning the words ‘Islam’ or ‘Islamism’, terms that are strictly taboo because political correctness and fear of reprisals totally prohibit any form of comment on this religion, and still less any criticism, the rapporteur still manages under cover of more general comments to condemn within the rules all the discrimination that the practice of Islam engenders. Thus, the banning of girls from taking part in some tuition and sports such as swimming, and all the traditional practices that are barbaric and damaging for young girls of the Muslim religion, are condemned. We are delighted by this. This report is a first step towards the beginnings of freedom of expression and clear-sightedness. We will vote in favour.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur is right to make the point that conventional sources of energy will remain indispensable for several decades to come. He is also right to call for diversification of energy sources and supplies, for safer and more environmentally conscious energy production and for more efficient energy use. We are somewhat sceptical, however, about the grounds on which these measures are urged. In the first place, the stated reasons are largely a repetition of the myth that climate change is due to carbon dioxide emissions from human activity. Yet growing numbers of scientists, while not disputing the fact of climate change, for the climate is constantly changing, are calling into question the notion of global warming, the culpability of CO2
 and the idea that the human race is behind it all. That being the case, the famous CCS (carbon capture and storage) technology – to which the report devotes much space but the long-term risks of which are unclear – sounds like a dodgy ‘quick fix’. Secondly, and despite the customary allusions to the Member States having primary responsibility for their energy choices, the rapporteur cannot help trying to steer them in a certain direction. Consider the space that his report devotes to the nuclear option – which remains entirely a matter of sovereign choice for each Member State and which cannot be considered solely from the perspective of CO2
 emissions. Finally, no mention whatever is made of globalisation as contributing to the over-use of fossil fuels. The promotion of international exchanges of goods at the expense of shorter, local and national, supply circuits is by no means irrelevant here. What the Commission has been doing for years through its ultra-liberal trade policy and the opening of our markets to global competition without a scrap of protection for our economies – whatever its underlying rationale – is very largely responsible for creating the problems that the Commission now claims it wants to resolve.

Mr President, colleagues, the report before us today is largely an exercise in stating the obvious. In it we find the same familiar statistics concerning employment rates, wage gaps and types of job. We also find never-ending descriptions of the persistence of gender-based stereotypes and the resulting discrimination reflected in women’s absence from certain sectors of the labour market. I am thinking in particular of advanced technology, the sciences, research and engineering. Yet the report contains an apparent contradiction. How can we welcome globalisation in paragraph 17 – hailing its positive effects on women’s access to education, care, health and employment, whether at home, in sub-contracting or in micro-enterprises – and at the same time, in paragraph 18, highlight the negative impact of globalisation with the feminisation of poverty? Which paragraph are we to take seriously? Elsewhere the report recommends pan-European measures to increase awareness of zero tolerance for sexist insults. But what constitutes a sexist insult? Was Ségolène Royal, who contested the last French presidential election, the victim of a sexist insult when one of her former Socialist comrades said she was not the best candidate for the highest office in the land? Or was that no more than a criticism, or simply an opinion? It is dangerous to base legislation on a notion like this that has no legal definition and cannot have one. Moreover, we are dealing here with an area that is essentially subjective and non-rational.

 We fully support the promotion of renewable energy, whether for transport, heating or electricity generation. Like all our fellow Members, we see it as a way of protecting the environment, but also of reducing our energy dependence. However, we cannot support Mrs Thomsen’s report. First of all, her real aim is not ecological or even economic, it is dogmatic: as indicated in the explanatory statement, the aim is to introduce a common European energy policy, and this must take precedence over everything else. However, energy policy, a matter of sovereignty and independence, should fall solely under national competence. In no way does this prevent cooperation and solidarity. In addition, the proposals in the report do not seem sufficient to guarantee that national circumstances will be properly taken into account: not only geographical characteristics, but also specific economic constraints. The text is also silent on the ways of helping countries that are least advanced in this area to achieve a binding, universal target. I say yes to renewables, but not as a pretext for extending the powers of the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the few areas in which we recognise that the European Union can offer real added value compared with national initiatives is research. That is why we are in favour of establishing a European Institute of Technology. We also share the concerns, or questions, of the rapporteur. The future EIT must be complementary and must not compete with initiatives already carried out at European level in the field of research and innovation. Above all, it must not drain the budget allocated to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development – which is already meagre enough – but should receive additional funding. In view of its design, which consists of bringing public and private partners together, it would be much better if its resources came mainly from private funding and from its operating revenue. This would be a sign of its usefulness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the European Union should provide the impetus, rather than create yet another bureaucratic organisation that is a burden on European taxpayers. For these reasons, it seems that the EIT label is a better idea than the possibility of the Institute issuing its own degrees and diplomas. On this point also, the EU must offer added value and not try to replace what already exists. Finally, this fear of pointless duplication, as well as financial and functional competition with other programmes, has led us to support an evaluation at an earlier stage than that proposed by the Commission, although the frequency of subsequent evaluations, extended to every seven years, seems too long. If our fears materialise, we would have to act swiftly to make the necessary adjustments, or even substantial amendments, to the regulation. Alternatively, even though this is not the norm for Europe, we would have to put an end to the experiment.

We support the Galileo project, even if we had a few reservations about supporting it. We cannot, however, support this resolution. It is deplorable that, after the predictable failure of the public-private partnership, this Parliament should be saying it is prepared to give up an independent GPS system if it ceases to be purely a Community project to include direct funding by Member States. Galileo is useful! By whatever means, it must be financed. The Commission cannot find EUR 2.4 billion, from the hundreds of billions that it intends spending, not always usefully, by 2013? Then what? Why should the Member States be pushed aside? Galileo is not a toy, nor is it the exclusive, symbolic project of Brussels’ Europe that wants us to believe that it is not concerned only for itself, its competences and its sustainability. Just for once, leave aside dogma. Put into this industrial venture a quarter of the political willingness that a handful of Member States put, a few years ago, into building a European aeronautical and space industry, and prove what you refuse to admit: intergovernmental cooperation works. In Brussels, on the other hand, it is at a standstill.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there are areas that should remain entirely within the competence, and under the responsibility, of the individual nations, they are surely those of education and the family. This report reminds us, in its first recital, that the Member States alone are competent in these areas. The problem, however, is that, in the paragraphs immediately following, it sets out to show that it is up to Europe to take action by promoting active policies that encourage, for example, ways to reconcile studying, training, private life and family life. Even though we might be in agreement with some of the proposals in the substance of this report, the fact remains that it is not up to Brussels, and still less up to the Commission, to tell the Member States what their demographic, family, educational or even professional policies should be. It is up to each Member State to know what its policies should be in these areas and to carry them out. We do not have to let ourselves be dictated to by some European text about measures relating to morality, religion or even fundamental principles or values. So it is, little by little, by means of recommendations, regulations or even directives, that Brussels interferes in national policies without being authorised to do so and without even having been approached by the peoples to do so. This systematic propaganda, particularly in relation to the family and to education, is aimed at destroying the traditional concept of the family unit, consisting of a mother, father and the biological children they have had together, and this in the name of freedom without limits and without moral rules.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the choice has been put before us of whether to ban outright or restrict the trade in the furs of cats and dogs in the EU, and I congratulate and want to thank not only the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, but also the Committee on Legal Affairs, which, having been asked for its opinion on this matter, has plumped for the first solution. It was in fact high time that the Member States were reminded that dogs and cats are companion animals and that the trade in their furs and in products derived from them must not be accepted or even tolerated. Imposing, by law, such a ban in Europe, and making provision for effective and deterrent sanctions in the event of its being infringed, is the very least one can do today. There is no end to the fraudulent and deceitful practices that one finds going on, particularly in Asia, with the labels of most clothes made there – be they coats, hats, handbags, gloves, and shoes, not to mention toys, decorations and small leather goods – bearing the deceptive description of ‘leather’ or ‘real fur’. If a stop is to be put to this ignoble trade, each and every European citizen must adopt a responsible and ethical attitude by demanding, specifically, the labelling of all leather, skin and fur goods and of all food and pharmaceutical products whose origins might be a matter of doubt. Let us unite in refusing to encourage those countries in which human rights and dignity are disregarded and which, moreover, have no sense of having a duty of care for animals.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome the many efforts made by my fellow Members, and also by the Commission, to guarantee the implementation and proper functioning of the Daphne programme – which is designed to prevent and combat violence against women, adolescents and children – by providing it, among other things, with a specific budgetary heading and by substantially increasing its budget. I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise a particularly disgusting development, incidences of which are becoming ever more apparent in our societies: the ill-treatment of newborn babies. Indeed, in France in particular, not a week goes by without our reading in the ‘news in brief' section about a new case of a baby being ill-treated or abandoned. This development, which is linked not only to poverty and social and emotional problems and to the inherent violence generated by our societies, but also to human behaviour tending ever more towards hostility and frustration, to selfishness and to a general lack of respect, could be curbed if more psychological and material support were given to women and to families in difficulty. There is in fact an urgent need to take preventive measures for these families and these women in distress. However, these measures should also be supplemented by genuine criminal sanctions. Whether we are talking about rape or other forms of physical violence that sadly all too often result in death, the scale of sentences is not repressive enough. The fight against violence also necessarily hinges on the way in which we treat the promoters of such violence. I am thinking of the Internet, where perverts and psychopaths can give free rein to their obsessions; I am thinking of video games, where sex and violence are legion; I am thinking of drugs and other psychotropic substances that put each consumer into a state of trance; and I am thinking of alcohol which, when consumed in excess, causes enormous damage, not least through its effect of ridding people of their inhibitions. The fight to be waged against violence begins at the stage of educating our children and of building the future that we want to offer them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around 250 million women in the world are disabled. Furthermore, in the European Union, the rate of employment of disabled women stands at 2%, compared with 36% for disabled men. These women are under-represented, and sometimes not represented at all, in many areas of social, professional, cultural and political life not just in France, but throughout Europe. In France, the law stipulates that companies with over 20 employees must meet the target of having a 6% disabled workforce. However, the average rate of employment of disabled people is in reality only 4%. It is downright unfair that companies should prefer to pay fines – even very large ones, at times – rather than to employ disabled people. However, 40% of disabled women are constantly seeking employment. This grotesque situation must stop. To conclude, I am surprised to note that the techniques of quotas and of positive discrimination, which are widely used by Parliament to, among other things, promote foreigners’ rights within the European Union or female participation in political parties and professional decision-making bodies, are not recommended so strongly for disabled women, or even provided for in this report. Europe is undoubtedly a multi-speed Europe.

We voted in favour of the resolution on the Galileo satellite navigation project. We have had the opportunity on several occasions in this Chamber to express our support for an ambitious industrial project, in which, for once, the European dimension had a full part to play, even though we have also highlighted the project’s shortcomings and flaws, such as its purely civil dimension and the transfer of technology to non-European countries such as China, that Communist dictatorship and exponent of unfair commercial competition. Today, the negotiations on the deployment and use of the system are at a standstill. Furthermore, it occurs to me that it was because of the political will of States that were very pragmatic in their efforts to cooperate with each other that all of the technical, human and financial resources were provided for the construction of a European aerospace industry and that Airbus came about. In the case of Galileo, because the Eurocracy has extended its powers, it is the Brussels-centred Commission that is struggling to negotiate with private partners, and the discussions are stalling over money-related issues. Clearly, the first method was by far the best.

Five days on from International Women’s Day, the European Parliament is proposing a roadmap for equality between men and women. Is the timing a coincidence? The fact remains that women are at the forefront, if not in reality, then at least in the texts. The report presented to us proposes a near exhaustive list of the measures to be taken to guarantee equality between women and men. While numerous proposals have been put forward, not least those relating to the measures aimed at better reconciling the obligations of family and professional life, it must unfortunately be said that many worrying and meaningless points feature in this report. I am talking, for example, about yet another attempt to introduce a system of quotas for the recruitment and participation of women in all economic and political sectors. We know that this measure can only be counterproductive in terms of the way in which women are portrayed and thought of. However, I am also talking about the pointless proposal to create a ‘Ms Lisbon’ in charge of ensuring that the Lisbon Strategy is implemented properly: a kind of ‘European superwoman’. Proposals such as this only discredit the initiatives taken to promote women.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from being clear, this report by my fellow Member, Mrs Bozkurt, has the great virtue of summarising the sad reality of women’s rights in Turkey. Indeed, despite all the declarations of intent from the Turkish authorities and the pseudo-reforms undertaken in the area of human rights, the reality is that domestic violence, honour crimes and forced marriages keep increasing, and that discrimination against women in the workplace and in education still goes on. However, this finding should not make us forget that, while it is true that these violations of women’s rights are incompatible with the concept of human rights, as they are laid down, for example, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the fact remains that Turkey is not European and that its future should not lie in the European Union. Indeed, even when it turns out that all the economic, legal and social criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Summit have been met, Turkey, 99% of whose population is made up of Muslims and 94% of whose territory is located in Asia, will still not share our values, which bear the stamp of Christianity and humanism. Turkey is a beautiful country, a great country, with a courageous, proud and hospitable people. We should, of course, preserve the privileged relations that we already maintain with Turkey as part of the customs Union, but Turkey cannot and must not under any circumstances join the European Union.

 Although an integrated approach to equality between men and women, particularly in the area of employment, is a necessity, its authoritarian and compulsory implementation and enforcement are not. However, that is unfortunately what is proposed in the report by my esteemed fellow Member, Mrs Záborská who, in the name of dignity and equality for women, asks us to vote in favour of a compulsory system of quotas for political parties’ candidate lists. We must not, I believe, give in to the temptation to put the ideology of gender equality above all else. That would be a counterproductive move and one that would ultimately do harm to the image of women who, through that very ideology, would be confirming the notion that, whatever their qualities, they are lacking in both competence and legitimacy. It is indeed necessary to give women easier access to certain jobs or areas of responsibility from which they have so far been excluded or in which they have hitherto been under-represented, but let us not go to extremes or be over-zealous in courting popular opinion, for we should in that way only be damaging the cause of women.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add two comments to this joint debate on energy. The first is that the European Union has absolutely no competence over energy, so much so that the various reports all stress that the Member States still have exclusive powers to make their own energy choices. On top of that, Mrs Morgan has included a specific reference to maximum subsidiarity. Everything in these reports, though, contradicts these statements, with their prescriptivism and demands. The second is that the Europe of Brussels has already shown what it is capable of, by usurping the right to run energy policy and liberalising the gas and electricity markets. What has been the outcome of this? Higher prices for consumers, attacks on standardisation of tariffs and therefore on public service, blackouts, concerns regarding the maintenance, expansion and modernisation of the networks, and the list goes on. We are currently watching the sector become increasingly concentrated, to the point that the much lauded competition that you bend our ears about is on the verge of becoming a monopolisation of the energy market by a handful of multinational companies. The only difference is that these monopolies will be in the hands of private investors, and perhaps not even European ones, instead of the public sector. Therefore, we are certainly in favour of energy security and energy efficiency, but it is up to the sovereign states to control these strategic matters.

We voted against the REACH regulation on chemical substances at first reading, in the belief that the adopted amendments would not make it possible to maintain the balance struck between the three objectives of this regulation: health and environmental protection; competitiveness and innovation; and the substitution of dangerous substances with less harmful or innocuous alternatives. The compromise proposed to us today is not a great deal more balanced. Admittedly, it includes some significant advances, as many speakers pointed out during the debate: simplified registrations; a more practical approach; and some, albeit insufficient, progress for SMEs, for example. However, it also has some gaps and ambiguities, not least concerning the constraints on imports and the potential disadvantages of this for European manufacturers, and also concerning the application of the substitution principle solely to dangerous substances, which is already a step forward, but which does not guarantee its effectiveness even in cases where technically and economically viable alternatives exist. Exchanging one imbalance for another is not resolving the problem. None of the three initial aims of the directive will truly be achieved, any more, I might add, than the aim to simplify the legislation or to make it compatible with other Community legislation will be achieved.

 Mr President, having seen the floodgates opened to uncontrolled immigration by means of the Schengen agreements’ abolition of EU border controls and seen whole swathes of asylum legislation communitised by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we are now being invited to go further down the road of delegating competences to the EU by abandoning unanimous decision-making in the Council on issues of judicial and police cooperation. Obviously, our Eurocrats never learn. Having been alarmed by the unceremonious arrival on the Spanish and Italian coasts of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants taking advantage of the absence of border controls in order to enter European territory and having bitterly noted Europe’s powerlessness to manage such situations, we now hear Mr Cavada, taking up where Mr Sarkozy left off, proposing to us that, by activating the bridging clause, we do away with the unanimity rule in the Council and so reduce by a still further degree the Member States’ power to make decisions about their migratory flows. It is not a Europe organised on federal lines that will be able to reduce cross-border crime. On the contrary, the European nations need to take a leaf out of Switzerland’s book, take their future back into their own hands and be able to protect themselves effectively against the onslaught of migration.

The Seventh Framework Research Programme is supposed to be designed as a tool at the service of an integral research policy that is simplified, is more accessible to SMEs and strengthens the links between research and industry in particular. It almost lives up to that aim. The fact is that concerns and questions remain, especially with regard to the participation of SMEs, where the access costs for participants and access to the risk-sharing finance facility still pose problems, with regard to coherence and the absence of confusion with other Community policies, with regard to the dissemination of knowledge, where quality and respect for intellectual property are issues, and with regard to the role of Member States in the governance of the programme. The seven-year duration of the programme also seems to be ill-suited to the pursuit of research goals, which are liable to change rapidly in spite of prescribed phases and evaluations. We also regret that research on embryonic stem cells has not been banned and that Parliament, like the Council and the Commission, has confined itself to mere definitions and restrictions in this domain. It remains no less true, however, that research, if it is the subject of a policy based on the pursuit of excellence, is one of the few areas in which the European Union can truly deliver better results than national activities could achieve.

The figures and estimates concerning human trafficking are frightening. Mrs Bauer’s report quotes figures of 600 000 to 800 000 men, women and children who are trafficked throughout the world each year. This is a form of exploitation that includes, at the very least, not only prostitution, but also forced labour or services, slavery and even organ removal. Yet, what the report does not tell us is that there are more and more of these human tragedies, ever since the destructive Schengen agreements abolishing internal border controls were signed in 1985. Europe's idea of heaven, the universally longed-for and coveted ‘area of security, freedom and justice’, proves not to exist in any of the Member States and, worse still, it proves to be dangerous and to be favourable to the development of all kinds of gangs and organised crime. As long as our national and European municipal worthies refuse to see that the increase in this international trafficking is due to open borders and that all the policies for combating human trafficking and illegal immigration hinge on the immediate re-establishment of border controls in Europe, the programmes and plans that follow on from one another will be worse than useless.

 Studies, statistics, reports, assessments … With Parliament’s support, the European Commission has, for some months now, been busily analysing the social, professional, political, economic and family situations of immigrant women in host countries. That is all well and good, as there is at present little reliable information that can be used in this area, even though we all know that women, and in particular Muslim women, suffer all kinds of discrimination. What, however, concerns me about this report is the fact that it highlights the rights of immigrant women who have entered Europe illegally. The right to vote, the right to family allowances and housing benefits, the right to remain in the host country … The report calls for, and lists, a whole package of rights but, bizarrely, it has not a word to say about a policy of returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin or, again, about a co-development aid policy for all those countries, very often African ones, which are suppliers of immigration to Europe. Europe keeps on welcoming people left, right and centre. In reality, Europe is transforming something that it deems unacceptable, namely illegal immigration, into something that it deems to be humanitarian and moral, namely legal immigration for population purposes.

I must congratulate my fellow Member, Mrs Breyer, on her report. Indeed, I can only endorse its conclusions, which recommend, and I quote: ‘radically changing the European Union’s trade policies’. It has taken a report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the rights not just of women, but of all workers, to at last be taken into account in the current globalisation process sought and undergone by Brussels. The rapporteur is almost naïve in her apparent discovery that competitive pressure in an increasingly globalised economy leads to a reduction in salaries and operating costs, to unemployment, to relocations and to the closure of businesses. The figures are in fact very worrying: 70% of the 1.3 billion people who live in poverty worldwide are women. However, I must admit that it is worth stressing here that gender inequality, particularly in Asia and Africa, where women are humiliated, scorned and considered inferior to men, obviously creates difficulties in the economic, commercial, social and political fields. Above all, it is quite clear that it is the very status of women that needs to be reviewed immediately in all of those countries in which Islamic law very often prevails.

 Madam President, every day millions of women are victims of abuse of all kinds, including violence from family members, intimidation at work, mental cruelty, sexual abuse and forced prostitution. In the EU, one in five women suffers what is referred to as domestic abuse, that is, violence perpetrated by her husband or partner. Let us not forget, however, that these figures only take account of reported violence. Indeed, fear, shame and the limited access to public services explain all too often why some violence goes unreported. What is more, some types of violence are not counted because they do not fit in with established definitions and are not considered as crimes because they are seen as taboo subjects. The Daphne Programme to fight against violence against women proposed by Parliament and the Council more than six years ago covers all forms of abuse, other than domestic violence, suffered by women around the world. In this regard, the emphasis should be placed on the fact that the large majority of such abuse is related to particular cultures and societies, in particular Islam and countries where Islamic law is in force, and in which stoning, genital mutilation, immolation and forced marriage are part of the culture, the religion and the customs. The Daphne Programme should channel its efforts into the fight for the woman’s right to information, protection and punishment for the perpetrators of the abuse, and should help to change certain mentalities and barbaric customs that sadly still exist in many countries governed by Islamic law.

Madam President, on the face of it, this report contains a number of sensible ideas: it talks about the crucial role of industry in a modern economy, even though, for years, the myth of a post-industrial society focused entirely on services has prevailed. It calls for the negotiations conducted within the WTO to take into account the specific characteristics of each sector, or the specific problems of each Member State, which is something of a cultural revolution but which will never be applied by the Commission, for which the European Union represents a single entity. The report demonstrates confidence in the bilateral agreements when it comes to settling the problems of market access encountered by your manufacturers, particularly in emerging countries, and the application of the principle of reciprocity in respect of international trade. This runs counter to the belief in multilateralism that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions in this House. The report is very sparing in its criticism of unfair competition and counterfeiting, against which Brussels fights so half-heartedly. This is indeed all true but, in essence, it is just meaningless talk, and nothing has changed. The European Parliament’s report, like the Commission’s communication, still proposes the same timeworn and disastrous formulas. The standard policy of competition and liberalisation, for example of the energy market, efforts to mitigate the effects of globalisation, which is regarded as inescapable and, in essence, beneficial to shareholders, the modernisation of intellectual property law, the symbol of which is the software patent – which was rejected by users and SMEs in the sector - and the simplification of legislation, such as the REACH Directive - that 1 200-page convoluted text that is jeopardising the European chemical industry. This is the usual litany of policies that have been conducted for years, with the aim of making people believe that what is required is a European industrial policy that is not provided for by the Treaties and, above all, with the aim of preventing the Member States, when faced with the resulting de-industrialisation and social disintegration, from taking matters into their own hands.

 Mr President, we are in favour of the research programme proposed, because it puts the emphasis on research into fusion energy and on the safety and management of waste. Nevertheless, we still have some concerns. We do not think that the 'fourth generation' power stations completely solve the current safety and environmental problems, and they also pose the problem of the large-scale transport of radioactive materials. Firstly, the designs set out, such as sodium-cooled fast reactors, seem to respond primarily to industrial interests. Secondly, with regard to informing the general public, 'the benefits from a safe use of nuclear power', to quote, must not, in view of the interests in play, result in the public being misinformed or even brainwashed. Finally, our enthusiasm for the international scientific cooperation that is coming into place, both for the fourth generation and for ITER, must not result in us losing sight of the fact that this cooperation is not synonymous with a lack of competition, and that the latter is based not on the principles of freedom of competition but on a strategic battle. We must prepare for this by defining clear strategies and by allocating the necessary resources to ensure that we do not simply replace our dependence on oil with dependence on something else.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are at the economic heart of our countries, the real creators of jobs and of wealth. That is why we can only commend the rapporteur’s concern to place the emphasis on them in this Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. In the face of today’s fierce global economic competition, very often what enables SMEs to survive is technological progress, small as it may be, which is always costly and continuously needing to be worked towards. That is why we should like access to this programme for small organisations to become more than just a pious hope. Information on the support they can claim must target small enterprises effectively, and not only those that have the resources to finance specialised services in the quest for grants. The rules for participation in these programmes must be really simple and transparent, and must not give rise to the prohibitive costs of compiling reports for SMEs. Consistency and complementarity with other European programmes and, in particular, with the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, must be guaranteed. The demand for better Community regulation that is simpler and more in accordance with the subsidiarity principle must cease to be, as it has been for the last 20 years, the slogan repeated over and over again but never applied. We shall see how it is when we use it.

When we know that in comparable employment a woman earns 11% less than a man, there can be no doubt that we have still to increase awareness of the effort that each of us needs to make in order not to establish parity and egalitarianism between men and women by force, which would be ridiculous, but to reach a state of justice and social balance. Advances in this area will not be achieved by means of a frenzy of feminism or by means of coercive measures which seek to forcibly impose the presence of women, whether it be in representative bodies or in management, far too often, as we very well know, without regard for their competence or quality. Let us show some intelligence by ensuring the promotion of women in society, particularly by allowing them to have a real choice between professional life and family life and allowing them also to be able to reconcile the demands of work and children. Nowadays, unfortunately, far too many women have no chance of this.

Even if the basic idea of the Energy Community Treaty (ECT) appears sound, insofar as it is concerned with helping countries in south-east Europe, which are experiencing significant problems in that sphere, we believe that this Treaty has, inter alia, two major flaws. Firstly, the Treaties do not confer any powers regarding energy – and, still less, powers of equivalent significance – on the European Union, the Commission having made use of provisions on competition policy to claim such powers. Secondly, the ultimate aim of the ECT is to create an internal energy market between the European Union and nine other countries, even though, within the EU, this policy has already shown its limits: the gradual replacement of public monopolies by monopolies or quasi-monopolies, with an attack on public services; the rise in electricity prices even in those countries in which electricity generation depends very little on the price of oil; the risk of shortages in the short term because of a policy that gives priority to deregulation faced with the issue of security of supply; and so on. There were other ways of helping our European neighbours to meet their energy needs aside from creating a controversial institutional and political system within the European Union itself. As usual, however, the pro-European ideology has prevailed.

The ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme is nothing other than a propaganda tool designed to benefit the European Union. This report notes that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in France and the Netherlands and that Europeans are sceptical about enlargement, meaning enlargement to include Turkey. Yet, far from drawing conclusions from this scathing disapproval, this report seeks to ‘re-educate’ the citizens! An initiative such as town twinning, which has been proving its worth for a long time now, is shamelessly hijacked, while millions of euros will be poured into communication circles and communication actions. One amendment, Amendment 14, even encourages actions at Community level! Referring to actions in the field of sport, the report points out, and I quote, ‘In this way, passive or even euro-sceptical citizens can be reached’. You actually intend to hunt down those Europeans who, unlike you, are not deluding themselves. The made-up expression “active” European values’, as promoted by this report, has no meaning whatsoever. A value is neither active nor passive, it is not a device that we can switch on and off, unless we do what you do, and behave like ideologues.

 Mr President, one thing is certain: there is no lack of structures and networks of all kinds devoted to studying and standing up for women. There are the Institute for Gender Equality, various NGOs, ad hoc committees, fundamental rights agencies, consultative forums on women's rights, the European women's lobby, and our own committee within Parliament. Therefore, is it really reasonable to set up a new European Institute for Gender Equality? In this cloud of structures, not always operating in perfect harmony in terms of the exchange of information, will this new body, which is supposed to network all of this information, have actual resources allowing it to exist? To be clear, can we now be sure that, beyond its future operationality, it will be completely politically and financially independent? It would appear not, as the Commission is not inclined to give this future institute very much room for manoeuvre. Indeed, its reluctance to allow the director of the institute to be answerable solely to the management board and not to the Commission is very revealing in that regard. For all these reasons and more besides, I cannot vote in favour of this initiative to create what I would describe as just yet another labyrinthine system.

 One of the greatest challenges facing the countries of Europe is their energy policy and their ability to use renewable energy to reduce their dependence on petroleum and gas supplies and on the fluctuating price of these resources. These renewable energy sources should take on a dominant role in the field of heating and cooling, which currently represents almost 70% of energy consumption in Europe. We therefore support measures that could encourage the use of renewable energy: informing users, removing administrative barriers, providing implementation aid, encouraging research and so on. However, we will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that the sovereignty of the Member States is respected with regard to energy supply, and on the taxation aspects of any proposals put forward. We have not yet seen all the consequences of the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets on national energy balances. And there is no question of giving the Commission, through fiscal proposals, additional powers over energy policy that it was not given by the treaties, but that it has already been able to appropriate by indirect means.

 Mr President, at the March 2000 Lisbon European Council, the European Union set itself the ambitious target of reaching a 60% employment rate for women by 2010. I fully support those ambitions and very much hope they will not be in vain, because many ideas are put forward, plans made and dossiers and reports written on the subject of equality between men and women, but few concrete results are seen. Social, pay and professional disparities are always a live issue in France and throughout Europe, too. Whether it is the improvement of childcare services – in particular by increasing the number of facilities available – or the promotion of new forms of working such as teleworking to make it easier to reconcile professional, family and private life, all these measures are much more effective in helping to promote equality between men and women than the systematic forced application of the concept of non-discrimination advocated by certain feminist lobbies that are very active in the European Parliament and which they use at every opportunity and always for highly ideological purposes. I am pleased to say that my colleague Mrs Estrela’s report is along these lines. We will all gain from showing pragmatism and common sense. Finally, I think it is also particularly important to take account of the distinctive cultural and ethnic characteristics which often stand in the way of promoting equality between men and women.

 Estimates of the number of women and children who fall victim to trafficking across the world vary from 700 000 to 4 million a year. According to the United Nations, 1.2 million are children. My colleague’s report takes as its starting point the tragic fact that despite the measures so far taken by the Member States and by the European Union itself, trafficking in human beings is today considered the fastest-growing criminal activity in comparison to other forms of organised crime. Sadly, this global phenomenon will not be stopped by piling up Community texts, resolutions or countless NGO reports on the subject. Indeed, while the causes have been identified: poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, the lack of border controls allowing the development of underground networks of all kinds of organised crime, violence against women, education, the explosion of pornography or the disappearance of moral reference points, the solutions proposed in this report are very vague, general and incomplete. If we are to combat all this organised human trafficking effectively, the first thing we must do is restore controls at the Member States’ internal borders. Their abolition with the Schengen Agreements was one of the main reasons for the development of this entire sex industry in Europe.

 The objective that the Council and the European Parliament have set themselves in this field, namely the principle of an integrated service to help passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility to access air transport, is not only laudable but indispensable, because there was an urgent need for action. There is currently a striking disparity in situations and treatment, whether with regard to access to airports or in terms of the assistance provided by airlines and airports. Be it the lack of a seat for a companion to sit next to the person with reduced mobility, the lack of medical equipment on board and on the ground, such as electric wheelchairs for example, or the lack of disability awareness training for airport staff, it is obvious that the principle of equality for all passengers is not respected to the same extent in all airports and by all European airlines. I am also pleased to note that the efforts that must now be made by the various airlines and airports must not entail specific supplementary charges for disabled people or those with reduced mobility. It is the least we can do.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Wallis on Mr Gollnisch’s request for defence of immunity is, both in its form and its content, truly scandalous. It is scandalous because the legal rules and the settled case-law of our Rules of Procedure and of the Committee on Legal Affairs have never before been so warped and violated. It is scandalous because the matter presented before the Committee on Legal Affairs was the subject of unprecedented politicisation and political pressure on the part of Mr Gollnisch’s political opponents. It has taken no less than four draft reports, all differing each time in their conclusions and reasoning, to come up with the report presented before us today in plenary, which is not, I might add, the report of which the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs had voted in favour, as the reasons behind the decision proposed by Mrs Wallis have subsequently been amended. The argument put forward by the report in support of the decision not to defend Mr Gollnisch’s immunity and privileges is that he was not using his freedom of expression in carrying out his duties when he spoke at the press conference held in his political premises in Lyon on 11 October 2004. What hypocrisy and what lies! The written invitation to Mr Gollnisch’s press conference mentioned, next to his name, his status as a Member of the European Parliament. The majority of the press reports referred to his status as a Member of the European Parliament. Moreover, the subjects successively addressed by Mr Gollnisch were connected with Europe, whether they were the issue of Turkey’s joining Europe, the ratification process of the European Constitutional Treaty or, furthermore, the so-called Rousso report mainly related to certain academics’ political opinions on the history of the Second World War in Europe. The settled case-law of the Committee on Legal Affairs in relation to opinions voiced by Members of the European Parliament tends, in this case, towards the systematic protection of immunity. Far more serious precedents involving prosecutions for libel, slander, uprisings against the police or even contempt of court have resulted in the immunity of a Member of the European Parliament being upheld. Yet, this has not been the case for our colleague Mr Gollnisch, thus undermining the independence and the freedom of expression of all Members. Make no mistake: if this report were to be adopted in plenary, the freedom of expression of all Members of the European Parliament would be restricted and subject to the discretion of others; a new interpretation of the waiver of immunity for opinions voiced by Members in the course of their duties would be adopted; and Europe’s oh so precious democracy and fundamental values would lose their hauteur.

We could not but be in agreement with an EU text that proposes the establishment of standards for the humane trapping of animals in order to promote animal welfare and the protection of certain animal species. Nonetheless, the Commission’s proposal presented to us is too unsatisfactory for us to be able to adopt it. How can we accept carrying out tests to create so-called ‘humane’ traps on animals themselves? Is that not a paradox, to kill animals in order to ‘humanely’ kill other animals? Furthermore, we are told that the welfare of trapped animals should be improved. Is that the case with jawed traps that crush under water? This trap does not succeed in eliminating suffering: mink take on average two and a half minutes before they lose consciousness and beavers nine and a half minutes. Trapping is held in total abhorrence nowadays and the Commission’s directive does nothing to eliminate it or even to limit it. This is an example of the same business-minded approach that is always applied. Let us remember that 15% of animals killed for their fur have been trapped and that this figure relates only to commercial furs…

 Mr President, in view of the European Parliament’s first reading of the draft regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, and whilst we approve of the role to be played by the European Agency, we must take a cautious position, because this text, even with all the amendments made to it, is full of holes and is far from being a success. In addition, it does not seem to strike the desired balance between the three fundamental principles: protection of health and the environment, the competitiveness of business, innovation and substitution. This lack of precision results from the cost distortions that such a regulation would cause, which apparently range from EUR 3 to 180 billion, and from the benefits, which are estimated to amount to between EUR 5 and 230 billion. This disparity in the costs announced by the Commission, just like the costs put forward by the industry, is enormous. However, we must not forget that these costs will be borne solely by the industry, that this directive affects 5 million jobs and that it will have serious consequences. That is why we will not allow ourselves to be influenced by purely political statements and why we will assess the various amendments put forward on a case-by-case basis.

Mr President, the report in question is remarkably rich and demonstrates a far-reaching ambition in the number of points it addresses. However, we know that we have neither the human resources nor the material resources to meet such a large-scale demand, and it seems to me that a certain modesty ought to guide our work. It is true that, at a time when we are enabling everyone to benefit from technological discoveries and when we are concerned about the way in which energy and food products are distributed, it is high time that we envisaged the creation of a European bank for health and prevention. It is quite obvious that, within the countries that have recently joined the European Union, a large part of the population is excluded from public health systems. These people do not go and enquire about health care. Should we not, therefore, think about health care coming to them by means of screening campaigns, vaccinations and primary care dispensed, regardless of gender, by mobile teams and equipment? While in our old European countries, in fact, the right to health care has become undeniable, the same cannot be said of these countries, where health and social protection is all too often aimed at those who have paid contributions so as to benefit from this protection. It is therefore the case that unqualified and unemployed men and women, elderly people and lone parents do not have access to the most everyday care. Leaving aside the resources that might come from the Structural Funds, such as funding allocations for the health care structures already implemented in these countries, it is imperative to ensure that a minimum level of health protection is given to these sections of the community. It would be wise, therefore, to begin with the children, as we know that without prevention and basic health care during childhood, incurable problems can set in. Then, depending on the needs, it would be a case of treating as a priority those areas with the most significant pathological conditions and, finally, of extending the scope of the activities. If we want to aspire to action with a humanitarian dimension, that is our duty as MEPs and that is the duty of our Assembly. It is a challenge, admittedly; however, we must have the ambition to accept it.

 Madam President, now that we are entering the development phase of this remarkable programme, as well as its deployment phase in which all of the space- and ground-based infrastructure will be created, it seems to us that two points are still vague. Via the Galileo programme, and in line with the Lisbon strategy, Europe is in the process of creating the first satellite positioning infrastructure on a global scale. This will bring us economic and strategic autonomy with respect to the US-owned GPS. This autonomy, however, seems to be incomplete, as it reveals a flaw in terms of political autonomy. Indeed, even though the intention is to secure personal data and to make the provision of information more reliable, this project, although it respects national sovereignty and strictly follows the subsidiarity principle, is purely for civilian purposes. It therefore leaves Europe dependent on the US military system for defence applications, and there is no real guarantee that the service will continue in the case of crises similar to the Gulf War, for example. Moreover, the risks involved in the transfer of technology via extra-European international cooperation do not seem to have been taken into account. Indeed, in the case of China, a financial partner in the Galileo programme, we cannot ignore the political origin and the potentially dangerous military interests, a field in which space technology can also be used by missiles. The same is true of commercial practices that may be reprehensible or else incompatible with European interests. In the circumstances, we call on the Commission to present a proposal that aims to safeguard the independence and room for manoeuvre of this programme in order to make Europe truly independent and to limit, or even to avoid completely, the risks of technology transfer in cases regarded as potentially dangerous.

 Mr President, this report, which has the merit of calling for the extension of two Community action programmes regarding equality between men and women that I fully support, gives me an opportunity to draw attention to the gaps and deficiencies in this field. Why are there such gaps with regard to respect for the rights of women and what are the reasons for them? We could mention, in particular, ignorance, archaic and sometimes barbaric notions regarding the place of women in society, machismo in the workplace, the guilt of women in this matter. Indeed, when women stand up for gender equality, they are accused of feminism or of hating men. This battle for equality is a tough one, then, and the EUR 50 million or so allocated for 2001–
2005 seem derisory in the face of rigid mentalities and existing inertia. Because what do we find? The gap between the salaries of equally qualified men and women is still huge, violence is continuing to increase, gender discrimination in terms of access to education, training and employment persists and it is still just as difficult for a woman to reconcile work and family life. One last word on the European Constitution that we in France are being asked to approve or reject. It contains nothing that will make a real contribution to the rights of women, but simply general principles on non–
discrimination and gender equality. Even if only for women’s rights, therefore, let us begin by making a stand by voting ‘no’ to this draft Constitution.

 Violence against women comes in many different forms: physical or psychological violence, rape, domestic slavery, the sex trade and prostitution, etc. They are ubiquitous and constantly on the increase. In our so-called ‘civilised’ countries which pride themselves on their respect for human rights and the rights of citizens, did you know that in France, six women die every month as a result of domestic violence, with almost no public reaction? Did you know that, in 2002, this violence was covered by an amnesty, while there is no amnesty for the mistreatment of animals? Surely women are not considered as being less worthy of protection. Only a few days ago, police violently beat women who were demonstrating peacefully in Istanbul. That has to stop. We need to tackle the factors which, as in the case of women in Islam, contribute directly or indirectly to their subjugation. It is intolerable that, in our countries and throughout the world, archaic and inhumane practices such as excision, honour crimes, stoning and decapitation should be accepted. This day devoted to women must not just be a symbolic event; it must be an opportunity for true awareness of women's rights in France and throughout the world.

 Mr President, despite technical progress, despite social advances of all kinds and despite measures being put in place seeking to extend these benefits to all of the countries of the European Union, too many women are still living in extreme poverty and this phenomenon is even more pronounced in the candidate countries wishing to join the European Union. There is even evidence to suggest that poverty is becoming an increasingly feminine problem. This poverty is due to obvious social factors and, crucially, to inequalities between girls and boys in terms of access to schooling, university education and professional training. Without training, no job and no salary. Without a salary, no social security contributions and therefore no medical or social insurance, no unemployment benefit and no pension. It follows that poverty increases with illness and, when old age comes, the situation becomes desperate. Nevertheless, these women have undeniably made a significant contribution to society throughout their lives by raising their children and doing jobs that are menial, badly paid and, usually, undeclared. As you will be aware, this poverty is also the cause of discrimination against women and trafficking in women. I therefore believe that it is vital to tackle this evil at its roots, because scattering individual subsidies around will not solve the problem for good and will not eradicate poverty amongst women. We must do all we can to ensure that they have equal access to schooling and professional training. That is where we need to start in our fight against poverty which particularly affects women.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two aspects of the ban on the entry into Portugal of the ship belonging to ‘Women on Waves’ which are worthy of consideration; firstly, the violation of the principle of free movement of goods and persons, as the Dutch ships were expressly prohibited from entering Portuguese territorial waters and thus from berthing, and secondly, the propaganda spread by ‘Women on Waves’. This ship, nicknamed the ‘abortion ship’, has been transformed into a floating clinic in order to supply the RU-486 pill, known as the ‘abortion pill’. It should be noted that this pill is banned in Portugal and hence not sold in the country. As it is, we do not believe that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has the necessary competence to deal with these two subjects, one relating to the application of international law and the other, concerned with abortion and contraception, relating to morality, ethics and religion. In this context, I should like to note that in its resolution of 3 July 2002, Parliament called on the Member States to conduct information campaigns on sexual and reproductive rights, and not to encourage women to use abortion as a method of contraception. With regards to this extremely sensitive issue, there is no place for politics, to say nothing of politicking, especially if the issue is used purely to win votes, as appears to be the case here. The European countries and their governments have the right to ensure that their cultural, ethical and religious sensitivities are respected, and they have the necessary authority to do so. The protest by our fellow Members appears to us to be nothing but a political act against the Portuguese Government, and this is an act with which we do not wish to be associated.
