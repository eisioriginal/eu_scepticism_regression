 Mr President, on behalf of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Group I congratulate the President of the Commission on assembling a talented team of new Commissioners from the ten new Member States, France and Spain. We welcome the political balance that is found among the ten, as well as the presence of three women. My Group will be giving its support to the enlarged Commission when we vote at noon today. The European Union needs a strong, legitimate and accountable Commission, capable of providing political vision and leadership. Our leaders must reflect this in the Constitutional Treaty and in their nominations for the next Commission President – but we cannot have a strong Commission until this House takes more seriously its role as the third branch of European government. Once in every five years this Parliament is the Union's personnel officer. We are there to take the proper measure of those appointed to the Commission or its presidency. To date our hearings of Commissioners have been handicapped by too much partisanship and too little sustained, in-depth questioning. So all of the Commissioners nominated in November can expect tough questioning from MEPs of the political centre, the kind of questioning that was too little in evidence at last month's hearings. This Commission is the first for a new enlarged Europe and the imperative for Liberals in this House is to ensure that it is effective, committed and competent. It is also important that we restate and establish once and for all the long-standing principle of individual responsibility of Commissioners to Parliament for their policies and their departments. It is inevitable that the work of this Commission will bind that of the next, just as the work of this Parliament will not be undone on 14 June. Like any executive, the Commission aims to provide continuity in the management of Europe's business. Much of this business has political import, yet there should be no suggestion that business cannot be done simply because the Commission is approaching the end of its term. That argument not only impugns the professionalism of the Commission and its officials, but it parades a tenuous grasp of the European agenda. The Commission's mandate is for the running of the European Union and yet there seem to be some in this House who would have it closed down for the summer. Do they not envisage that the settlement of the European Union's budget for the next seven years or the question of Turkish membership might make some demands on the Commission's attention between now and November? Liebe deutsche Freunde, das müsst ihr ernst nehmen!
 To close down the Commission's right of initiative at this point would not only be wildly impractical, it would be downright irresponsible. Let us read between the lines here. My Group will not be party to efforts to paint the Prodi Commission as a lame duck. Nor will we be a part of attempts to manufacture that lameness now by restraining the Commission's powers. European Commissioners are bound to leave their politics at the water's edge. This House should show a similar maturity. The treaties require a degree of impartiality from Commissioners that would be difficult to counterfeit and that is why, for all their posturing, the critics of Mr Prodi have yet to provide any evidence that his other interests have negatively affected his work in Brussels. European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have had their share of criticism of some of the Commission's policies but we have always recognised its individual talents and its collective commitment. This week we need only think of the extraordinary work of Commissioner Verheugen in helping secure a successful European enlargement. The new Commission will begin its term with one thing in its favour. Many familiar faces are likely to be there again in November. This continuity can and should be an asset. Likewise the Commission must have the necessary latitude over the next five months to prepare the ground and to maintain the momentum necessary to make it a success. Indeed, to insist on anything else – especially just to pay party political dues – is risible. (Applause)

 Mr President, you have given 15 years of tireless service to this House and on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to pay tribute to the leadership and the vision that you have shown during your term of office. You have proven an outstanding President of our House, raising our profile, ensuring that our voice is heard in the Council and beyond. Through your eloquence and your judicious use of the well-crafted sound bite you have communicated the practical benefits of our work to our citizens. I am proud that the first Liberal President of this House in 22 years should be one of its most successful. I would like to highlight briefly two achievements. Your energetic campaigning for enlargement and the determination you have shown in reforming this House will go down to your great credit. As my predecessor as leader of the ELDR Group, you demonstrated our commitment to enlargement by involving MPs from the candidate countries in our work. You continued with your energetic campaign for a 'yes' vote in the candidate countries and in bringing observer MEPs here to our Chamber in 2002. You have brought this Parliament closer to reforms than ever before and I have no doubt that as a result of your work we will succeed in reforming this House. We are sure that you will still have much to contribute to Europe in whatever you do in the months and the years ahead. We say today 'au revoir' with a vote of thanks and our best wishes for the future. (Applause)

 Mr President, this report is not about Silvio Berlusconi. It is a report about media concentration in all countries of the European Union, which is a matter of legitimate public concern. It is a report that has been drawn up in accordance with the normal procedures of our House and, in recognition of the electoral sensitivities of some, the rapporteur has offered to delete Mr Berlusconi's name from the report. Nonetheless, some colleagues are seeking to delay, to filibuster, to disrupt our procedures in order to evade the harsh searchlight of an unpalatable truth. My group calls on the PPE-DE Group to withdraw these wrecking amendments; and if it will not, we are ready to vote on all 350 of them. We ask you to allow the House to decide whether to proceed and we welcome your assurance that we will have a chance to vote on this report.

 Mr President, on Saturday, Cyprus votes on the Annan Plan and its future. Cyprus stands at a historic juncture. European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have consistently urged all parties to support the plan and we do so again now. The Annan Plan offers Cyprus a chance for reconciliation and renewal. It is a door to a better future on an island that has endured too much for too long. The plan makes important concessions to both sides. With goodwill on both sides it could be a first step away from years of partition. My Group thanks Commissioner Verheugen for the leadership he has shown in this matter. We regret that more EU leaders have not expressed the same commitment more volubly. The European Union will underwrite a huge amount of the reunification process and the Court of Justice will provide a legal framework for its resolution. This is the last, best hope for a unified Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May. We salute the leaders on both sides in Cyprus who have supported the Annan process and have commended it to their fellow Cypriots. 'No' would have been the simple choice: the answer which rhymed easily with resentment and suited political expediency. 'Yes' took courage. There are many Cypriots, particularly on the Greek side, who ask what business it is of ours to be having this debate at all. In the face of all our concern and consternation they offer simply the shrug of self-determination. They can and will vote as they please and they have the right to vote 'no'. But I believe it would be a sad and sectarian choice, the wrong choice for the wrong reasons. Moreover, if the purpose of self-determination is the freedom to go on nursing old resentments and the right to weigh the money in your pocket today against reconciliation tomorrow, the Cypriots who have turned their faces against this process are welcome to it. I would just ask them to reflect on this. What if the West Germans had chosen that kind of self-determination in 1990? On our scarred continent with its crowded history there are some old scores where restitution and compensation can only ever be relative. Only the historically illiterate can believe that we can somehow fix what has happened in Cyprus, anymore than we can fix Kosovo and Serbia or Israel and Palestine. What Cyprus needs is a modus vivendi
: some way of living that looks forward rather than backward. The Annan Plan is a modus vivendi
. If it is lost on Saturday it could put back the reunification of Cyprus by a generation. The European Union would have to face up to a new reality on the ground: the possibility for a peaceful transfer of land will be lost; the Turkish army will continue to guard what will remain a militarised border; UN peacekeepers will patrol within the European Union. The English writer Lawrence Durrell, who lived for many years on Cyprus, recorded a Greek Cypriot proverb that says there is no fire in old ashes. Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House hope beyond hope that Sunday will not find Cypriots stirring the cold old ashes of a sad history. (Applause)

 Mr President, this House has discussed on a number of occasions the matter of the Commission's proposed agreements with the United States. The House has expressed its own willingness to reach agreement with the United States on exchange of data on air passengers in a proper international agreement, to be approved by Congress and by this House, to ensure that we get the right balance between data protection and an effective fight against terrorism. The Commission is deeply divided on this matter, and is unable even to claim adequacy because it does not know about the circumstances in which the Americans can refer data to third countries. We are seeking the advice of the Court of Justice on whether this is compatible with our own laws and our own Treaties. I advise this House to think very carefully and to refer it to the Court. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, referral to the Court is not something that we would have chosen. The Commission promised to consult us under Article 300 with the power of assent. The Commission has not fulfilled that promise and, therefore, we have had to use a very blunt instrument to try to maintain democracy within this Union. ***
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, I will not go into the substance of this matter since we all know what it is about. My Group has no objection to taking part in 600 votes tomorrow, but we have a clear preference for your suggestion that we simply vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph. A long voting session is already foreseen, colleagues on both sides have had their say, and, therefore, I propose to you that we follow your suggestion of voting on the original report paragraph by paragraph. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, surely if the rapporteur is requesting a referral back to committee of her own report, and there is a dispute, then the House should vote on this?
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, we have decided to refer this matter to the Court of Justice. If we are now to take a vote on the report rejecting the agreement, then we are showing a discourtesy to the Court. If the House were to vote to accept the agreement, then we would be prejudging the Court's judgment. It seems to me quite natural that since we are awaiting the Court's ruling on the matter, we should wait in committee with this report before voting on it. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on an excellent report. It is perfectly possible to be both tough on terrorism and true to the Treaties that we have signed on individual freedoms such as privacy. This matter has taken a sorry course. Commission Bolkestein told us on 9 September that progress on the issues had been disappointing. Commissioner Patten has told us tonight that data transfers remain a matter of concern for the Commission. The fact is that there is no real agreement between the European Union and the United States on the scope of data required, on purpose limitation, on data storage periods or on the transfer of data to third countries. In proposing this amendment, the College of Commissioners should be ashamed of itself. Its proposals would do justice to the authors of the United Kingdom's Official Secrets Act of 1911. Commissioner Patten, you normally address this House in an open style, almost ad-lib. That is something we welcome. Tonight you read carefully from your script; dare I say with your lips moving faster than those of a policeman giving corrupt evidence. You constructed a quasi-legal case that is no more stable than a house of cards. You can hardly be surprised that you face criticism from all sides of this House. The Commissioner told us there is no reason for Parliament to reject the entire agreement. The fact is that we are not even being offered the chance to do so. Despite Commissioner Bolkestein's assurance on 9 September that the procedure would involve the European Parliament's assent, as required by Article 300 of the Treaty, neither this Parliament nor national parliaments are being given the chance to comment on this. This is a disgraceful demonstration of Europe's democratic deficit. We therefore call on the Commission to withdraw this agreement and to replace it with a proper international agreement. Failing that we will have to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, I did not accuse the Commissioner of acting like a policeman giving corrupt evidence, I said that his lips were moving faster than those of a policeman giving corrupt evidence. However, I accept that my remark might have appeared insulting and I would therefore like to withdraw it.
Watson (ELDR

 Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to congratulate the Commission, and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular, on his efforts to try to reach agreement with the United States on such a difficult matter. My Group regrets that he has not been more successful in persuading the United States to respect our concerns about data privacy. My Group cannot agree on the choice of legal basis. While, as Mr Bolkestein says, the agreement does not formally amend our data protection directive, it clearly amends the law as it applies to European Community citizens by making us subject to US law in this area, and the absence of protection in US law is precisely our concern. There is a huge democratic deficit when the Commission comes forward with a proposal like this and does not give either the European Parliament or national parliaments the chance to say yes or no. Now, as Mr Bolkestein informs us, that the information being passed to the United States' authorities may be passed on to third country authorities, we should be seriously concerned. There have been three debates and votes in this House on the matter. Three committees have examined it and all recommended a referral to the Court of Justice. My Group does not seek a dispute with the Commission. We have asked the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to try to negotiate with the Americans and present to us and the US Congress a full-blown international agreement to cover these issues so that we can effectively fight terrorism together while respecting our commitments to data privacy. We would prefer the Commission to do that, but if the Commission cannot do it, perhaps at least at its meeting tomorrow the Commission could agree to take the initiative in referring the matter to the Court of Justice to decide whether there is adequacy.

Mr President, it has been a while since everybody left a European Council meeting smiling. I congratulate the presidency on a focused summit that delivered in many respects. This summit suggested that there is another Europe: one that can actually get things done. European Liberal Democrats and Reformers welcome the new will to reach agreement on a European Constitution by the June European Council. President-in-Office, a combination of events and canny diplomacy have paved the way for agreement. In the words of an Irish blessing, 'may the road rise up to meet you'. This House badly wants a deal, but our terms have not changed and will not change. We expect a treaty based closely on the Convention text. We expect the Council to respect the budgetary powers of Parliament and extend democracy in our Union through qualified majority voting and greater codecision. We expect the Council to make the difficult compromises needed in good faith and then go back to sell those compromises at home. This show will not be over in June. Ratification is a mountain still to climb. This summit also acted decisively to fix the way we protect ourselves against terrorism in Europe. My Group welcomes the appointment of Gijs de Vries as anti-terrorism coordinator and demands that he be given a clear mandate to ensure he can get the job done. The next step is to reinforce the resources at Europol and set it to work: no new bureaucracy, no duplication, no more foot-dragging from European intelligence agencies who do not like to play with others. If this is not our frontline defence against terror then it is just a cheap gamble with the safety of Europeans. Liberal Democrats and Reformers also back a strong commitment to ratifying existing instruments such as the European Arrest Warrant. We have proposed an implementation league table that will name and shame states which take lightly the safety of their citizens. The weekend's decisive tone has to translate into action. Let us be clear about that new decisive tone. Let us remember what Europeans – what Madrileños – had to endure. This House has been urging a more concerted policy on terrorism since before 11 September 2001. Let us recall that when the Commission asked for EUR 15 million for counter-terrorism intelligence last year, the Council offered EUR 1 million. Europeans deserve better. A counter-terrorism policy conceived in panic is far too likely to invade private lives and erode public freedoms. On biometrics, on passenger data transfers – that is what we are in danger of getting. My Group wishes to remind the Council that it has once again ignored the explicit demand of this House that it discuss detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay and that it commit to raising that issue with the Americans at the EU-US summit. Any European government that reckons on the issue going away has not reckoned on the will of this House. My Group welcomes the commitment in Council to speeding up the pace of reform on the Lisbon Agenda. We remind the Council that 40% of the single market directives have not been implemented in all Member States. We remind the Council that the Growth and Stability Pact must be revived this year so that Europeans can have confidence in the sound management of Europe's economy. The tone of public debate in Germany and France suggests that European governments are not properly making the case for reform at home, whatever they may say in Brussels. Before this summit I called for a sense of urgency on three areas: terrorism, the IGC and economic reform. To paraphrase W. B. Yeats, of our quarrels with others we make rhetoric, of our quarrels among ourselves we make poverty. The summit showed a willingness to get back to the business of Europe. Let us hope the political will holds and the momentum lasts – for all of our sakes. (Applause)

 Mr President, the Commission is in an unenviable position. Airlines are almost certainly breaking the law on data protection by giving the US authorities confidential information about their passengers. To take action would harm our airlines and may lead to disruption in travel to the US; not to act rides roughshod over individual privacy in the European Union. The Commission has sought to reach an agreement with the United States. The concerns about this agreement are widespread. They are shared by the Article 29 Committee, and quite possibly by the heads of state and government meeting last weekend, who amended the draft presidency conclusions on this issue. They are very much borne out from this House in this report. In the United States widespread criticism of methods adopted by the government in the fight against terrorism is evident, whether it is to do with the policy of detention without trial or the way in which the heavy hand of the state is being imposed in areas like this. The Commission's proposed deal on the transfer of data is a deal too far: more information is sought than is strictly necessary; that information can be held too long with no right for the individual to correct it; there is no right to compensation for people denied boarding of aircraft and no legal redress against abuse of personal data by the state. Liberal Democrats believe that it is possible to be tough on terrorism and true to the treaties we have signed on civil liberties. We bow to nobody in our determination to fight terrorism. We urge our Member States to act more effectively. We recognise the need to work with democracies across the Atlantic; but let us do so intelligently, with a response that is measured and proportionate, and not sacrifice our freedoms in our determination to fight those who threaten them.
Watson (ELDR

 Mr President, this Spring Council will be dominated by the economic reform agenda and rightly so. Yet there is something a little strange in talking about the future of Europe when the draft constitution fashioned to facilitate that future languishes in Council. Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House welcome the intensive consultations undertaken by the presidency. Signs from most national capitals suggest that it should not be beyond the wit of our Member States to deliver a deal. President-in-Office, we urge you not to give up on your efforts to break the deadlock at the IGC and secure a constitution for Europe before the elections to this House in June. I should also like to thank you, President-in-Office, for going off-script in your remarks. Your line that it is 'possible to find a consensus in the context of a process leading to a conclusion' is one of Sir Humphrey's finest. I am pleased to see that he is alive and well in Justus Lipsius. (Laughter)
 However, your line that the key to it all is political will is exactly right. The potential problems of an EU of 25 are painfully clear. Without institutional reform this Union cannot function effectively. It is time to stop pretending that life will somehow go on if the IGC fails. Forget the infamous Polish slogan 'Nice or death'. For an enlarged Europe, Nice is
 death. I share the Commission's concern about tinkering with the draft constitution. Some of Europe's leaders are playing poker with the Union's future in the last chance saloon. It is time to show our cards: governments, people, parliamentarians alike. Do we demand a stronger, more credible Europe at home and abroad? Do we insist on integration where it is needed? Do we want the President of the Commission to be Europe's best and brightest, able to command support across party lines? Liberal Democrats and Reformers are in no doubt about our answers to these questions: yes, yes and yes! I regret that the European left, which gave us the inspirational leadership of Jacques Delors, now seems to lack conviction about the future of our continent. Mr Poettering's platoon seems more concerned about making the next President of the Commission their political plaything than about the content of his or her programme. It is alright, Mr Poettering, for Wilfred Martens to claim that the PPE-DE is 'uncompromisingly pro-European': you look more like uncomfortably
 pro-European to me! Do you speak in the name of all of your Group, or just one part of it? The European Council also has to debate Europe's external relations. It should be recognised that without exception, Europe speaks more strongly in the world when it speaks with a single voice. That is why, President-in-Office, I make this appeal to you: last night, five of the nine British detainees at Guantanamo Bay were repatriated to the United Kingdom. Even as a British citizen, I see this less as a gain for Britain than as a loss for Europe. Because if the Council had pushed Europe's case over bilateral bargains, we might have had a more united and principled stand. We should have insisted on securing the release of all Europe's detainees from Guantanamo Bay. (Applause)
 I challenge your presidency to stand up for our Union's values by speaking for Europe as a whole at the EU-US summit on the issue of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees. We have to pull together now as a continent or we will fall apart. The pro-European forces in government and this House have to make their case with conviction, because we need a new constitution, a new credibility and a new self-confidence, and we need them now. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would advise Mrs Banotti to follow the advice once given to me by the Station Master at Crianlarich, when I pointed out to him that the two clocks, one on each platform, showed different times. He replied, 'What good would it be having two clocks if they both told the same time?' (Laughter)

 Mr President, in January Liberals in this House welcomed the presidency's strong focus on the Lisbon Agenda. Your priorities for the Spring Summit have restated that commitment. Europe is stuck in second gear. As America accelerates, as a resurgent Asia pulls into the passing lane, Europe is trailing behind. We must not let the recovery fool us. If Europe is picking up speed it has more to do with the slope of the road than with the state of our engine. As Commissioner Lamy said a week ago, we have oversold expectations of Lisbon and we have underinvested in results. Any sustained economic recovery in Europe has to be built on job creation. An export-led return to growth could conceal an American-style jobless recovery that will leave us no better off when the road levels out or when the next climb begins. More and better employment is the key to sustained growth and prosperity and the only sustainable route to social cohesion. We cannot allow recovery to be a fig leaf for governments reluctant to reform. A return to growth can only hide the weaknesses of the European economy; it cannot remove them. A failure to use the good times to gain leverage against the bad is the very failing that did for the Stability and Growth Pact. This summit must rebuild that pact around a new order of commitment to financial discipline and debt management. Governments must free people to work the hours they choose and keep the flexibility they need. We have to make work pay and open new ways into work for women and older people. We have to end the failures in education and re-education that are limiting the potential of too many Europeans. We have to invest more in research and development and foster more competitiveness and innovation. The only European social model that matters is the one that preserves our common prosperity for the future. We need to set attainable targets and concentrate on delivery. We know what needs doing. We need delivery on policy, not wish lists and hand-wringing. Another 'high level group' will simply deliver another expensive tranche of obvious conclusions. While my Group supports job creation and the return of older workers to the employment market, we had more in mind than consultancy positions for retired prime ministers. The presidency has rightly identified the need for European governments to act more decisively, not only in Council but at home. In many cases the commitments made in Council have been allowed to stall at the transposition stage. The latest figures from the Commission show that last month 131 internal market directives – that is 8.5% of the total – have not been fully implemented in at least one Member State – in breach of their own deadlines! We need to be tougher on policing the internal market. This Spring Summit has to be about delivery. Before June, Liberal Democrats in this House expect final decisions on crucial measures to assist European worker mobility, including in the area of the mutual recognition of qualifications; we want real progress on a framework directive on services, and we feel that it is past time for agreement on a financial services action plan that can free up Europe's capital markets. The Lisbon Agenda gave us a decade to reform. Five years on, too little has been done. We cannot afford to be standing here five years from now wondering how we let Europe get left behind.

 Mr President, political murder is a heinous crime in darkness: it is even more chilling in daylight. Mr Chea Vichea, trade unionist and member of the Cambodian opposition, was shot and killed on January 22, beside the road in Phnom Penh, in the middle of the day. So brazen was his killer, that passers-by mistook the bullets for firecrackers. Mr Vichea is the fifth member of the opposition Alliance of Democrats to have been murdered in 2004, and the latest victim of a year of violence. His funeral brought into the streets a crowd estimated at 30 000 strong. I know why, having met Mr Vichea last April and been deeply impressed by his commitment to democracy and good government and improving the lives of his fellow citizens. Mr Vichea was a founding member of the Sam Rainsy Party. He was a committed advocate of the rights of Cambodia's 200 000 garment workers. His killing, along with that of activists from the Funcinpec party, adds to a temper of political intimidation in Cambodia that is worsened by the failure of the caretaker government to respond to these murders. Whether the Cambodian People's Party is responsible for these killings or not, its persistent failure to apprehend and punish the killers leaves it accountable for the rising tide of fear in Cambodian politics. Hun Sen's government continues to rule Cambodia without full legal and constitutional authority. It is imperative that a negotiated settlement be reached to enable legitimate government, yet negotiations cannot take place in the shadow of political murder, which sours attempts to construct a viable coalition and threatens to provoke retaliatory violence. The European Parliament must condemn not only this killing, but also the climate of intimidation and impunity that Cambodian authorities allow to persist. Our resolution calls for the suspension of all non-humanitarian aid to Cambodia and for the European Commission to refuse to deal with Hun Sen's government. The EU should not do business with a government that fails to safeguard the lives of democratic leaders. In conclusion, we call on the Council to issue strong words of condemnation.

 Mr President, my Group has no problem with the second of those amendments, but we feel that the first weakens the text and therefore we object to it.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, it seems that some of our Member States have been seized by a seven-year itch: it is the irresistible urge to scratch around for the best financial deal for themselves. But in their rush to advance their own interests, the Member States are failing to ask what might constitute the best deal for Europe. Liberal Democrats and Reformers believe that governments should first, as the admirable Mr Colom i Naval has suggested, take a long, hard look at what they have asked the European Union to do, and then give the institutions the resources they need to do the job. Governments should also ruthlessly tackle waste and fraud, most of which occur at national level, and target spending on our priorities to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers. Britain, France, Germany and three other states have formed an unholy alliance, united only by their zeal to keep down their budget contributions. Even putting aside the wider benefits that the European Union buys, the EU needs a budget consistent with its responsibilities. This year we will integrate ten new Member States. Europe is charged with important new responsibilities abroad, and with the task of keeping us safe from crime and terrorism at home. Reviving growth requires progress on the ambitious reform agenda of Lisbon. Do the six states really expect the EU to do all of this on 1% of Europe's gross national income? With spending set to reach 1.11% of GNI in 2006, a ceiling of 1% in 2007 means not recalibration but cuts. None of these Member States can tell us where the axe will fall. Indeed, I would wager that they cannot even agree among themselves. My warning to Europe's citizens would be caveat emptor
: buyer beware! These are the same governments who agreed in 2002 to a 1% annual increase in spending on the common agricultural policy. If Member States demonstrated a real willingness to reform the CAP further, it would be easier to take seriously their calls for parsimony. As it is, we are running this Union on just over 1% of the gross national income of the Member States, when the budget of the Federal Government in the United States is 20% of GNI. We must continue to strive for savings where possible, but also equip the Union to meet the objectives we have set ourselves. My Group believes that the key to better value lies in a modest budget increase, leaving a safe margin for unforeseen expenditure, linked to reform, less waste and more intelligent investment. Not promises of smarter spending from Member States with no will to deliver it. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 Secretary-General, Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House echo your words on immigration. We recognise the value that immigrants bring to Europe and we understand that closing Europe's front door will only drive the desperate to seek access through the back. Many of us were migrants once upon a time and we know how ill it behoves our generation to shut the gates of mercy on mankind. A Europe of security and justice for all is a Europe that extends those rights to those who justly seek a new life here. Like you, we recognise the political challenge that implies. Your words today remind us of the power of the United Nations to transcend the parochial in us all. The United Nations has a precious power to speak for us all. That is why my Group wishes to see the return of the United Nations to Iraq as soon as the security situation allows. Credible and legitimate democratic government in Iraq is not possible without the presence of the United Nations. (Applause)
 We want a political settlement in Iraq that guarantees the highest standards of civil and political rights for all Iraqis. The United Nations was founded by the same generation who founded this European Union – ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind’. Like this Union it believes that the closer we sit at the table of peace and prosperity, the slower we will be to reach for the tools of war. It is a sorry testament to a stubborn world that the UN still seems such an unlikely experiment in international governance. Winston Churchill once said that the UN is designed not to take us to heaven, but to save us from hell. In order to do that better the UN must reform. As its largest contributors, the EU and its Member States have not only the weight to insist on reform but the responsibility to do so. A mature Europe would find the political will to put behind it an institutional settlement at the UN that leaves power where it lay in 1945. A mature Europe would insist on a permanent membership that reflected the realities of the 21st century. It would accept that the current veto is a tool of obstruction, a privilege that can no longer be justified. Finally, Secretary-General, on behalf of the Liberal Group allow me to pay tribute to the members of your organisation who will not see you take this prize in their name today. Your staff who lost their lives with Sergio Vieira de Mello – including Fiona Watson who was known to me – died defending a vision of national renewal in Iraq that is now our duty. (Applause)

 Mr President, President-in-Office, at the beginning of the last century, a disgruntled writer from Dublin went to live in Italy. He wrote a famous novel in Trieste, a city that some years after his death came to mark the southern end of a line which divided our continent for half a century. This year, under this Irish presidency, that line will finally be erased. History, as Stephen Daedelus reminded us in James Joyce's Ulysses
, is a nightmare from which we are trying to awake. The Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement. It is an historic moment: the final act of the revolutions of 1989. It is appropriate that a country which speaks for the transformative power of the European Union should oversee that process. But we should not be tempted to believe that we can separate enlargement from agreement on the instrument designed to make that step possible. Integrating the new Member States into the Lisbon process and Schengen cannot hide the fact that without the additional framework of a new constitutional settlement we are simply changing the oil in a Union which needs a new engine. Liberals in this House welcome the Taoiseach's strong commitment to advancing the work of the IGC. December's tempers have cooled. Europe's destiny is in an altogether safer pair of hands. This time, Europe's leaders must choose to succeed. My Group also welcomes the presidency's intention to sustain the momentum of enlargement by concluding accession talks with Romania and Bulgaria and by responding to the request from Croatia. We, too, see this as the moment to achieve an historic settlement with Cyprus. The presidency also rightly focuses, too, on the Lisbon Agenda in what can only be called its hour of need. Most of the structural problems identified at Lisbon remain obstacles to wealth creation. The political will needed to undertake reform and give the eurozone credibility has not yet clearly been summoned. The Celtic tiger has long stood for the benefits of competitiveness and economic discipline. Now it is time for you to roar in the Council. We welcome the commitments on the Framework Directive on Services, published by the Commission yesterday, and on the Financial Services Action Plan. We welcome the commitment to work with the European Parliament to secure the adoption of the Trans-European Networks proposals. But your modesty about what you can achieve must not obscure the need to resurrect the Growth and Stability Pact in some form under this presidency. The presidency's assessment of our agenda abroad is also sound. We welcome the focus on African issues, on the holocaust of AIDS and poverty and hunger. We accept the need to work constructively with Russia, although we expect hard words on Chechnya and on Russia's vanishing political pluralism. We welcome the attempts to rebuild bridges in our transatlantic friendships. But here the Council's loyalty to European values means that Guantanamo Bay must be on the agenda of the EU-US Summit. The EU must act together to demand conscionable treatment for all detainees in Camp Delta, including the Europeans who have now been held for two years without charge. I welcome, Mr President-in-Office, your commitment to review justice and home affairs in the Union. I hope you will not overlook the worrying Amnesty International report on human rights within some of our own member countries. My Group welcomes the presidency's political commitment to take the Statute for Members forward. That commitment must now be carried through into reform by both Parliament and the Council so that the statute can enter into force after the elections. Mr President-in-Office, your work programme is a worthy one. If my Group could offer you a slogan for it, it would be 'restoring belief'. Deliver a deal on the Constitution and see in enlargement and you will have done Europe, and Ireland, proud. Carry that spirit through to the European elections in June, to a pan-European campaign with a continental consciousness rather than 25 national campaigns, and history will give you rich reward. (Applause)

 Mr President, Liberals in this House expected rather more from the presidency of a country with a proud European tradition. In six short months, the presidency has conspired to undermine the Stability Pact, has shown contempt for the European Union's policy towards Russia and offended Canada. The President-in-Office has treated us to a 40-minute catalogue of the achievements of his term of office. Yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and IGC have been a personal failure for the President of the European Council. The 'piece of paper' in Mr Berlusconi's pocket turned out to be a gelato
-stained napkin with a few bad jokes scribbled on it. The President came to the IGC poorly prepared; he ignored the warnings of this House that holding back compromise proposals would produce this kind of stalemate. (Applause)
 While the Americans were digging Saddam Hussein out of a hole in Iraq to global acclaim, our leaders were digging themselves into a hole in Brussels. A successful summit needed two things: political will on the part of the major countries, and skilful diplomatic leadership. It showed neither. This IGC was not fated to fail  it chose to. Five countries walked away from an agreement which everybody needed but none of them wanted enough. Yes, a delayed deal is better than a bad one. But the problem with postponing a decision by kicking it into the long grass is that you might not find it again. Especially with a crowded agenda ahead which includes negotiations on the next financial perspectives, talks on Turkish membership and elections in Spain, Britain and Italy. So after a short post-mortem, the IGC must resume and must conclude its work under the Irish presidency. The Irish have Mr Ahern, one of Europe's most seasoned negotiators, and Mr Cox, the President of our own House, whose joy at the Charlemagne Prize we share. It may be possible to relaunch the European Union. Our first Constitution deserves public debate and endorsement, and that requires a Treaty before the European elections in June 2004. I would like to underline the extent of the concern felt by Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House and beyond and our feeling that the actions of the larger Member States are plunging the European Union into a crisis which could endanger the democratic nature of our Union. The summit conclusions are also a disappointment to us. There is nothing on Guantanamo Bay, despite the explicit demand of this House that our leaders should uphold the rights of the detainees. On Russia, the conclusions scandalously make no reference to elections which the OSCE called 'a regression in the democratisation process'. (Applause)
 The decision to bring the People's Republic of China into the Galileo programme seems to have encouraged talk of the lifting of the European embargo on selling arms to the world's only significant remaining Communist dictatorship. (Applause)
 On all these issues, the Council behaved as if it is ashamed of our values  or ignorant of them altogether. At your press conference after the summit, President-in-Office, you said that but for the IGC, your presidency would be remembered as 'the most glorious of recent years'. Yet agreement on the five issues mentioned by the President of the Commission represents a meagre return on a presidency in which such high hopes were invested. If this was a glorious success, I would be fascinated to know your definition of a failure. You set your presidency the target of a Constitution by Christmas. By your own standards, you have failed.

 The Liberal Democrat delegation did not vote with the rest of the ELDR Group on the Schmidt report. We voted against Amendments Nos 1 to 13 and the proposal, as we wished the proposal in its current form to be withdrawn. Our reason for doing so is that we believe VAT on postal services, especially in respect of securing a universal service for packages below two kilogrammes, is a matter best left to national governments under the principle of subsidiarity. However, we remain open to considering future proposals aimed at ensuring greater competition.

 Mr President, all eyes are on efforts to agree a Constitutional Treaty before the year is out. The irony of our leaders making new rules for the European Union only days after breaking the Stability Pact will not be lost on our citizens. At the same time, we look to the European Council to shoulder its responsibility, to stand up for the rights of European citizens who continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay. In Naples, our Foreign Ministers managed to move closer to agreement only by moving further away from the Convention text. My group regrets that the tide of reform will not now rise to the high water mark set by the Convention. The Convention's extension of codecision to budgetary powers would have made the European Union more accountable and transparent. No viable parliamentary democracy can exist without the power of the purse. The obduracy of finance ministers on this matter is a battle pitting raw politics against the principle of reform. I welcome the remarks of the President of the Commission. We must not cede on this point. We also have to resolve the issue of voting weights so that the efficiency and accountability gains promised by the Convention are not entirely lost. To us, what really killed the Stability Pact was certain countries confusing their power to break the law with the right to do so. In Guantanamo Bay, the United States has fallen victim to the same confusion. America was founded on the principle that the free are governed by laws, not men. Countries have borders, but principles do not. There is no line on a map beyond which such values no longer hold. The prison at Guantanamo Bay squanders a precious American legacy and surrenders vital high ground. For two years the 660 men and boys in Camp Delta have been denied the rights of prisoners of war or of civilian criminals. They have been charged with no crimes. The military commissions that will judge them will grant no right of appeal and no access to an effective defence. Dostoyevsky once wrote: 'You can only know the nature of a civilisation by visiting its prisons'. Of all the tests that a civilisation can be handed, the responsible use of power over the powerless is the greatest. Sadly, the standards of detention and justice at Guantanamo Bay are unworthy of a country with America's proud history of civil liberties. (Applause)
 While I welcome the news that some detainees may shortly be repatriated, winning a reprieve from this disgrace for a few Australians and a few Europeans renders more stark the injustice committed to those who will be left behind. Europe must press for every man and boy in Guantanamo Bay to be either immediately charged, face justice in their home country or be released, regardless of nationality. President-in-Office, I hope that will be high on your agenda. I call upon this House to demand of the European Council an unequivocal statement of Europe's dismay, and I call upon our President to convey that message. I call upon the European Union’s leaders to ensure that bilateral deals do not silence Europe on the greater principles at stake. The Liberal Group adds its support to calls for the European Parliament and for the Council to submit an Amicus Brief to the US Supreme Court on behalf of the detainees. Two of our greatest enemies in the fight against terror are the fear that makes us cheapen our freedoms and the power that makes us cynical of them. If you at the Council can find the will to do justice to our enemy, then we will already have won. (Applause)

 Mr President, the obituaries for the Stability Pact have been written before and then held back as the patient lurched on, if only on life support. What we witnessed last week was finance ministers giving the last rites to rules which were intended to guarantee the long-term stability of our currency and economy. Of course, the guilty parties deny all responsibility, or claim 'the Pact is dead, long live the Pact'. But the truth is that the eurozone's two leading economies have sent a message to all the small countries in the eurozone, and to the acceding countries, which reads 'do as we say, not as we do'. And I should like to point out to Mr Tremonti that the Italian presidency has failed in its duty by acting as an associate in the endeavours of the countries concerned to flout the Pact, rather than ensuring that the rules were respected. We will pay a heavy price for the cavalier disregard of finance ministers for the rules of the Stability Pact. We will pay a price in terms of damage to the trust between Member States, in terms of lost credibility in the eyes of our citizens, and, in the long run, in terms of higher interest rates, lower growth and currency instability. Unless our leaders agree on a revised and workable framework for fiscal stability, and inscribe this in our basic law, then we are left with nothing but a broken gentlemen's agreement. Countries which gave up their currencies on the understanding that they would not be expected to pay for the debts of their neighbours have a right to demand more than that. That is why my Group welcomes the stand taken by Commissioner Solbes and the Commission's intentions to make proposals to reshape the rules. If you kill off the Pact in its existing form, you have a responsibility to commit yourself to an agreed interpretation of a set of rules to prevent a borrowing free-for-all. Liberal Democrats believe that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle. The problem is not the 3% deficit limit; the problem is the failure of countries to consolidate their budgets in terms of growth. My surprise at hearing the leader of the Socialist Group in this House agree with us is matched only by my delight at his conversion. The revised rules should provide sticks and carrots to ensure that we take advantage of periods of economic growth to run budgets in balance or in surplus and reduce national debt. Countries which operate a responsible policy in the good times could benefit from more flexibility in bad times to let borrowing take the strain. These rules should provide for early action against countries which do not control their deficits in periods of growth, to force them to take corrective measures. A new target for the underlying budget balance could be added, and government expenditure on investment should also be taken into account. The European Commission should have greater authority to police these new rules, since national governments have shown that they cannot be trusted to do so. This has been a bad week for the rule of law in the European Union. My Group hopes that at the summit in Brussels our leaders will recognise their responsibility to salvage, from the wreckage of the Stability Pact, some credibility for Europe's fiscal policy . (Applause)

 Mr President, when Peter the Great wanted to make Russia more Western, he dressed up the Russian aristocracy in Western European clothes and moved the capital of Russia westwards from Moscow to St Petersburg. President Putin's westward-looking government has described the European Union as its 'natural political partner', and until recently Russia has appeared to dress in the clothes of Europe: the clothes of free trade, the clothes of political and civil rights, the clothes of infant democracy. The ELDR Group welcomed this EU-Russia summit. We are right to look for political and economic spaces where our two societies can work together. Under the right circumstances, we welcome closer economic relations between the European Union and Russia. Easier travel is a necessary and important part of making this work. Russia and the Union share a common security environment and a high degree of mutual interdependence, so we are right to seek to make our joint borders more secure and our shared hemisphere more safe. We welcome Russia's ambitions to join the WTO and this may be possible, even if it is made more difficult by recent events. However, Europe is right to rail against Russian repression and governmental meddling in the lives of its neighbours. The issue of Chechnya will not go away, nor will Russia's refusal to ratify Kyoto. It is not enough to wear the clothes of Europe. Closer relations should carry the price of full subscription to modern European values, and at the very least we must continue to be critical and frank. At this summit, Mr President-in-Office, our position was badly compromised by those charged with representing us. The presidency's ill-considered comments on Chechnya and on the arrest and detention of Mikhail Khodorkovsky were out of line. Mr Berlusconi speaks for Europe and he should choose his words with care. His own presidency drafted a declaration last month that was strongly critical of Russian conduct in Chechnya. However, not only was there no reference to Chechnya in the summit communiqué, but the President of the Council even thought it appropriate to contradict Europe's affirmed position with an improvised display of bluster worthy of a cheap lawyer. In any case, why should we deny the difficulties of the Russian minorities in the Baltic states? They are nothing compared to the persecution of the Chechens. Internal security may be complementary to justice and human rights, as the President-in-Office said, but as practised in Chechnya it is not. We have condemned Russian action in Chechnya and the attempt to intimidate sources of political opposition in Russia for good reason. Despite their European clothes, it is not clear that Mr Putin's government shares our values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of expression. If it does, why is Mr Khodorkovsky in jail?
Watson (ELDR

 Madam President, I share the views expressed by my colleague, Mr Martin. We would be forgiven for thinking over these last months that Europe has only one transatlantic relationship, so often do we use that term to describe the link between our Union and the United States of America. The Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, once said that living next to America was like 'sleeping with an elephant'. Even its smallest movements were likely to keep you awake at night. Europe's own sensitivity to the movements of the current American elephant can all too easily overshadow our relations with its northern neighbour. The EU-Canada summit is a chance to renew this relationship. The European Union and Canada have a long history of productive cooperation to build on. We share the same views on the best strategy for defeating international terrorism and international organised crime. We are common supporters of NATO, the UN and the ICC. We share a strong commitment to Third World development assistance and environmental protection. Both the EU and Canada have ratified the Kyoto protocols, and led the call for others to do so. The Ottawa Land Mines Convention expresses our joint abhorrence of these weapons and our determination to act. There was a time when Canada sought actively bilateral trading links with Europe as a way of reducing its dependence on trade with the United States. It would be facile to see NAFTA as Canada's surrender to economic destiny. Canadians continue to invest significantly in Europe: almost EUR 65 billion last year. In return, we provide over a quarter of foreign investment in Canada. We take almost 20% of Canada's service-related exports. The Commission's strategy document dwells rightly on the good will which exists between us, but identifies rightly that very little positive action flows from it. We must deliver such action. High level meetings between Canada and the EU have too often lacked clear objectives. This summit should re-launch our relations on much more proactive terms. The presidency has recognised this, in making the negotiation of an ambitious new accord one of the priorities of its tenure. For this reason, it is extraordinary that the President-in-Office of the Council has chosen not to accompany his delegation. I have been told by Canadian diplomats this evening that Mr Berlusconi's tactless decision has led Canada to consider cancelling the summit altogether, or to reschedule it for a European venue earlier in December. Given the importance of this summit and its established place in Europe's diplomatic calendar, Mr Berlusconi has shown an unacceptable willingness to offend our friends in Ottawa. For the second time in as many weeks he has embarrassed the Union, and in this case offended a valuable ally. The ELDR urges strongly that the summit goes ahead in December as planned, preferably in Canada, and in Europe only as a last resort. Even in Mr Berlusconi's absence, this summit must deliver an agreement that takes away regulatory barriers to closer trade and investment. Given the importance of our large store of common North Atlantic values, this summit should assert that Canada and the EU will henceforth cooperate proactively in foreign and security policy and on environmental questions. This means aligning our positions before major international meetings. The summit must also produce concrete proposals for a steering group to assess the future management of our relationship. We need more formal meetings at official and expert level, and a much more focused relationship. As soon as a Constitutional settlement is achieved, the 1976 Framework Agreement with Canada should be updated. In conclusion, it is time to equip our other transatlantic relationship for the new century.

 Mr President, I will be brief because I have lost my voice – and I do not mean politically, I mean physically! It is clear that a battle royal is going on within one of our larger Member States. The main protagonists in that battle royal happen to be the current President of the Commission and the current President of the Council. It would be unrealistic to suggest that people in such positions have not had a political past, or do not have a political future to look forward to. There is a question mark over whether the occupants of those posts should be engaged to such an extent in such a political battle while holding those offices. But it would be naïve of us to assume that such battles will not continue, and indeed naïve of this Parliament not to imagine that such people will take those positions.
Watson (ELDR

 Mr President, I do not wish to go into the content of this particular opinion poll, although it certainly would have been wise for the poll to have asked what people thought of the Palestinian State and of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. It is not a bad thing, however, that people know what Europe thinks. I would, in general, encourage the Commission to publish information –
 of this or any other nature –
 on the views of Europeans, to show the importance of opinion on our continent. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 Mr President, I congratulate the Commissioner on having brought the accession countries to a stage where fewer than 40 serious concerns were raised out of the 140 elements of the acquis
. Most of those concerns are in the area of health and food legislation, or of public administration. Without making light of the concerns, is the Commissioner confident that the obstacles can be overcome by next May? Moreover, on Bulgaria and Romania, a clear difference is emerging. I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he will give the clear signal that Sofia has asked for on the Union's final requirements, and whether he will be tough with the Romanians on the very substantial progress that Romania still has to make. I welcomed the Commissioner's remarks on Turkey. The reforms of Prime Minister Erdogan's government are real and must be welcomed. They must be fully implemented; Commissioner, you are right to demand more, particularly regarding political rights and Cyprus. But let us acknowledge Turkey's very strident steps forward and I hope that the Commission will commit itself to finding all of the resources possible for working with Turkey to help it towards membership.

 Mr President, I have in front of me 26 candles. I am aware that this could set off a fire alarm and would therefore be grateful if you would allow me to make this point in advance of the report by the President-in-Office of the Council. I would like to ask the President-in-Office to comment on one issue which was not raised at the summit and which the Liberal Group feels should have been raised: the continued detention without trial of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay. These 26 candles are a symbol that these detainees should not be forgotten and, indeed, I hope that these 26 and all 600 detainees will have access to justice. I would ask the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, to raise this at every opportunity with the US Administration and to place it on the agenda for the next EU-US summit. The President-in-Office complains that he is a victim of injustice before the law himself and so he should be particularly concerned about this very real injustice on a far greater scale.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, the Liberal Group in this House welcomes the Italian Presidency's initiative to associate the President of this House more closely with the work of the European Council. Nonetheless the overwhelming feeling of the European Liberal Democrats is one of disappointment at the outcome of the European Council. We fear that it may be recalled, if at all, as a summit distinguished more by what it failed to discuss and agree than for what it actually achieved. One issue that was not raised is the continued detention, without charge or trial, of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba of whom I spoke earlier. As a symbol for them, I have in front of me 26 candles. I am sorry that the President-in- Office did not respond to my invitation to say a few words this morning about the continued detention of those European nationals and, indeed, of all 600 detainees. It seems to my Group that their detention without charge is a scandal and that the failure of European Union leaders in the Council presidency to keep the matter on their radar screen must be remedied. This House is no less concerned by the situation in Chechnya. The wrongs which are being committed daily, in the name of the fight against terrorism, will hasten the rainfall of revenge which refills the tributaries of terror. With less than two months to go until the end-of-the-year summit, by which time we are supposed to reach agreement on a new Constitution, the presidency had no time to lose. We fear that an opportunity for progress may have been missed. But handed an agenda with little real substance, EU leaders gave back even less. I question whether it was wise for the Italian Presidency not to push for decisions on the Constitution or to make compromise proposals now rather than leaving things to November. That may be too late – politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The lack of proposals has encouraged some countries to retreat from the Convention's agreement, and Poland and Spain to get a hearing for their self-interested sentimentality for the discarded agreements of Nice. The crucial common defence clauses were discussed 'over dinner' but apart from Mr Blair's welcome U-turn on structured cooperation, we appear to have achieved little apart from giving America indigestion. Nor was there substantive progress on economic reform. While we welcome the European growth initiative and the refocusing away from spending on white elephant transport projects towards investment in R[amp]D, the real focus to get back to growth must be progress on structural reform. We would have liked to see the Council putting its legislative money where its mouth is and building the dynamic, open economy we were promised at Lisbon. Progress on Justice and Home Affairs was limited, with little forward movement on the important issues of immigration and asylum. The one positive development, the creation of a European agency to manage the security of our expanding borders, was again agreed beforehand and merely rubber-stamped. The flip side of the coin is the proposal for biometric indicators for passports and visas which should have set civil liberty alarm bells ringing loudly but which seemed not to trouble the summit at all. President-in-Office, much rests on your November compromise text for the Constitution. It will be your last throw of the dice and we wish you luck since we fear you may need it! (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – 
Mr President, we do not have the chance to come back on this debate, and I do not wish to trespass on the goodwill of those in the House. I would simply ask the presidency and the Commission to explain why we should expect Europe's voters to vote for Europe if we do not have the solidarity and the commitment within the Commission and Council to stand up for the rights to which our continent has subscribed.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 –
 Mr President, as we approach the first European Council of the Italian presidency and assess the progress thus far, is the glass of prosecco that the presidency will offer next week half full or half empty? On the evidence of the inaugural meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Rome I fear it is half empty. When the Member States convene again to discuss Europe's draft constitution, they should recall the shambolic Nice Summit and reflect on the costs of failure. Poland and Spain should be reminded that their intransigence over the reform of voting weights in Council is perilous politics as well as poor mathematics. If the Nice arrangements were satisfactory, the Council would not have established a Convention in the first place. The system of majority voting agreed at Nice is unwieldy and unfair. To its credit, the Convention threw out the unsteady compromises of Nice and proposed a voting system which is fairer and more transparent. Last time I checked, the representatives of the Spanish and Polish Governments had signed up to the Convention's outcome: now they must respect its work. On other issues too, the hard bargaining has been done. The consensus crafted by the Convention will not be improved on in Rome. Unpick the substance of the draft Treaty and the IGC will drag on into 2004 and descend into diplomatic farce. Then Rome really will be the eternal city. When it comes to economic reform and the Stability Pact, the bubbles in the prosecco have long evaporated. France has yet to convince us that it takes its responsibilities seriously. La France désire-t-elle vraiment jouer le rôle du 'je-m'en-foutiste'? Il faut voir. 
While we understand the reluctance of some governments to confront France, a Stability Pact without teeth is a paper dragon breathing tinsel flames. The eight governments which have worked hard to play by the rules - often at considerable political cost - have every right to be dismayed that their larger neighbours take fiscal laxity so lightly. The Italian presidency's drive to enhance Europe's competitiveness at the European Council is welcome. But we need to move beyond bold declarations. To achieve better and simpler legislation we need proper consultation and business impact assessments. A level playing field for company take-overs is still frustratingly far away and we have much work to do to agree a viable framework for an integrated market in investment services before the European elections. My group welcomes this week's decision by finance ministers to refocus the growth initiative away from road and rail projects and towards investment in innovation which will help to close Europe's research deficit. In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, there is more sparkle in the Council's agenda. The balance which the Liberal Group seeks to ensure between tackling illegal migration and providing for a system of managed legal migration seems to be essentially there. We will support the Commission in its efforts to create a Border Management Agency. Europe's new eastern border will be one of the longest in the world: it is crucial that we pool our expertise in policing it properly. Sadly, the external agenda of the Union leaves us no cause for celebration. The failure of Cancún must redouble our determination to secure reform of the WTO and trading arrangements which help the world's poorest countries. Europe must insist on a central role for the United Nations in return for the internationalisation of the situation in Iraq. And the tragic events of the past week in the Middle East confirm the need for Europe and America to remain engaged. My group condemns unreservedly the suicide bombings in Haifa, but calls on Israel to abide by international law and act proportionately in its response. A new Constitution, a credible Stability Pact, a revitalised economy, a secure and just Europe in a more stable world: these would be the flavours of a truly vintage year: le auguro buona fortuna per la vendemmia
. I too must apologise to Council and Commission for having to leave before the end of this debate. The rescheduling of this debate has caused me this embarrassment. (Applause)

 –
 Mr President, two weeks ago a London newspaper convened a meeting between senior journalists from Israel and Palestine, the first of its kind since before the current intifada. A number of participants, from both sides, expressed the belief that theirs was, in effect, a 'twenty-second century conflict': a war that would last a hundred years, blighting the lives of their grandchildren's children. A conflict that has the capacity to exhaust the optimism of the best of us once again demands deeper reserves of patience and commitment. But grim as the situation is, we cannot afford to despair. If the two sides have strayed from the roadmap's path of peace and reconciliation, we must coax them back. The European Union must continue to play a crucial role in the search for peace in the Middle East. Greater engagement with Israel might help in this. Making peace also requires a strong, functioning and accountable Palestinian Authority. That is why the Union has spent more than EUR 300 million since 2000 to keep the Palestinian Authority in business. An effective and legitimate Palestinian Authority is essential to dismantle the terrorist organisations. The Palestinians also need a strong voice to negotiate with Israel. The European Union must step up its support for financial reform of the Authority to help it distance itself from terrorism. We have also provided more than EUR 30 million for the vital work of Palestinian municipalities in providing basic public services, because that is how you fight despair – with clean water and classrooms; with the promise of normality and peace. We may regret Yasser Arafat's intransigence, but we should remember that if the Palestinians voted tomorrow in the fair and transparent elections we would like to see, they would probably choose him again as their leader. The surest way to ensure that outcome would be for Israel to make a martyr out of him. Arafat's place in the peace process is not for us to determine, any more than it is for Israel or for the United States. However, we can have no truck with terrorism. That is why my Group welcomes the inclusion of Hamas in the European list of terrorist organisations. Suicide bombings have taken an unbearable toll in Israeli lives, and the political apologists for terror cannot receive support while the killing continues. Both sides have to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict. Israel's extra-judicial killings must end, as they will only breed more terrorists, not force the Palestinians to negotiate. Israel must withdraw its forces from the Occupied Territories, and the settlement building must stop. Two states, living side by side in peace – that is the only viable solution. Israel's existence as a Jewish state and as a democracy demands a Palestinian state. The alternatives are Palestinian apartheid or the inexorable demographic eclipse of Israel's character as a Jewish homeland. The roadmap, of which the European Union was the chief cartographer, recognises this, and my Group remains firmly committed to its implementation.

 Mr President, President of the Convention, I too have the honour of congratulating a predecessor for the impressive work he has done, but I cannot continue in the vein of Charles Aznavour and say ‘You are for me, formidable’.

Mr President, Liberal Democrats in this House join the tributes which have been paid to Sergio Vieira de Mello and all the other victims of the callous attacks on the United Nations in Baghdad. The unstable and violent situation in Iraq shows that while a coalition of the willing may be able to win a military conflict, winning the peace without the legitimacy of the United Nations is a much more difficult matter. My Group, therefore, welcomes the tentative moves towards a UN resolution which would place the coalition forces in Iraq within a multilateral framework. Liberals have always favoured a multilateral resolution to the problems posed by Iraq, and if the coalition is belatedly coming round to that view, then it is better late than never. The so-called 'coalition of the willing' was a curiously outdated 19th century balance of power concept, which always carried with it the danger of leaving at least one nation feeling aggrieved. What we seek is a multilateral, rules-based framework for crisis management within which there is space for the hurts of nations to heal. There is no reason why the United States should not retain command of a multinational UN force in Iraq, but it must be based on a UN resolution and give the UN and contributing nations the central role in decision-making. Failure thus far to find weapons of mass destruction is leading to searching questions at hearings in London, Washington and Canberra and raising doubts about the legitimacy of the enterprise. The way to give the international presence in Iraq a sense of legitimacy and regain the trust of the Iraqi people is to mount a UN-backed drive to restore security, to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis and to move towards government by popular mandate. The swearing-in of Iraq's first post-Saddam cabinet today is a tremendous step forward in that respect. We hope that the timetable for elections by the end of next year can be maintained. My Group welcomes the Commission's initiative in convening a preparatory meeting today in Brussels for the important conference of international donors next month in Madrid.

 – 
Mr President-in-Office, until last night your programme was available only on your website and only in Italian and it is still now available only in Italian and English. While I have the good fortune to use a computer and to read both languages, some colleagues do not. I hope this is not a presage. Your primary task will be to convene the IGC to examine the draft Constitution. My group shares your ambition to finish this work as soon as possible, and in good time before next year's elections. We trust that you will provide adequate representation of the European and national parliaments whose involvement in the Convention helped make it such a success. But the future of Europe is up to the Member States. If they continue to fight over it, it will be not a Treaty of Rome – not even a Treaty of Dublin – but perhaps a Treaty of Utrecht, representing peace through exhaustion. Liberal Democrats agree with your priorities on the European economy. Our economy is in a bad way; the German motor of European growth is stalling. So initiatives to revive growth are welcome. Yet the completion of the trans-European transport networks must be viewed as a means to an economic end – the smoother functioning of the internal market – and not as an end in itself. As a British Liberal, I am delighted by the fidelity of your programme to John Maynard Keynes, and my delight is matched only by my surprise. However, I hope you agree that the spending you propose on TENs and on defence must be compatible with Member States' commitments under the Stability Pact, which is already under great strain. For Liberals the continuing value of Keynes lies in his insistence on solidarity. Your programme speaks much of consumers, but we are citizens first and foremost. Market ideology tricks people into equating buying power with voting power, and it robs us of the civic freedom by which we control the social consequences of our private choices. Where regulation is needed is where the gains from remedying market failure for citizens or the environment outweigh the costs of government intervention. In Italian political debate this is the difference between liberalismo
, in which we believe, and liberismo
, which we very much reject. My group supports the closer cooperation you propose with countries around the new borders of the EU, but we should not offer false hope of membership to our neighbours. Closer relations with the Union must be linked to democracy, respect for human rights and development of a market economy. We particularly welcome your emphasis on the Euro-Med partnership, which has long been a Liberal priority, and your plans for Albania, where Italy can surely show a lead. Your programme's proposals on transatlantic relations, which are on the mend after the breakdown caused by the crisis over Iraq, and your aim to rebuild ties with America are welcome. However, while seeking common ground with the United States, we must not shy from speaking up for Europe's interests where we disagree, and we welcome the strength of your statement on the International Criminal Court On the Middle East too, the Union must project its voice in the Quartet strongly and clearly. Assistance in rebuilding the Palestinian economy must be conditional on action against terrorism, as improved cooperation with Israel must be conditional on progress in implementing the road map, notably on dismantling settlements. On agriculture and on immigration, Liberal Democrats find much less in common with your priorities. These two policy areas are linked. You say very little in your programme about CAP reform and yet at present every cow in Europe gets a subsidy of EUR 2 a day, while one billion of our fellow citizens worldwide must survive on less than EUR 1 a day. Unless we open our markets to farm produce from developing countries, their people will vote with their feet. The policies you propose on justice and home affairs seek mainly to prevent immigration. They will not work because you cannot beat the law of supply and demand which operates in labour markets like elsewhere. When you tell us you are concerned about Europe's reputation 'Cercheremo di fare bella figura per l'Europa', lei ha detto
, please bear in mind that white Caucasians are in a minority on our planet. We hope that you will be guided in justice and home affairs by the balanced approach of the Greek Presidency, rather than by the tenor of Seville. Mr President-in-Office, your country assumes the presidency following a highly successful Hellenic Presidency, marked by the search for compromise and agreement. Liberal Democrats in this House hope that in your tenure in the Chair you will, in your words and actions, respect the dignity of the office and honour Italy's traditional European vocation. (Applause)

 –
 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, looking at the balance sheet of the Greek Presidency, the items on the plus side of the ledger well outnumber those on the negative side. Given Europe's difficulties in the last six months with the Iraq war and economic stagnation, that is a remarkable tribute to your government. Your first priority, rightly, was to meet the timetable for enlargement of the European Union. The signing of the Accession Treaties beneath the Acropolis and seven successful referenda have amply met this goal. Our joy at Europe's reunification is nonetheless tinged with sadness that Greece was unable to exploit its privileged relationships to bring in a united Cyprus. Please do not cease your efforts. We also regret the tensions which surfaced between 'new' and 'old' Europe over Iraq, despite your best efforts and two common positions to your credit. Bringing the Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty safely into port also deserves to be chalked up as a notable success of your presidency. The Liberal Democrats in this House agree with you. The draft text agreed by the Convention provides a good basis for the Constitution, and we will hold Member State governments to the commitments they have made. We welcome the extra time given to the Convention to complete its work on Part III, though for the Council to describe the remaining discussions on majority voting and codecision as 'purely technical work' is a masterpiece of understatement worthy of the British Government's description of the whole process as just a 'tidying-up exercise'. The vanity of victory teaches us far less than the humiliation of defeat and Europe's failure over Iraq seems to have had some beneficial consequences, notably in driving forward European cooperation in security and defence policy. The establishment of the rapid reaction force, the launching of operations in Bosnia, FYROM and the Congo are certainly pluses. However, the weaknesses in the quality and coordination of European defence spending are clearly negatives, which we hope will be remedied by the new Armaments Agency. Our failure over Iraq also helped you adopt two remarkable documents at Thessaloniki: Mr Solana's EU security strategy and the Council's declaration on weapons of mass destruction. The security strategy provides a fitting European response to the US doctrine, resting as it does on the European principles of multilateralism and prevention rather than pre-emption. The statement on WMD makes clear to our American friends that we are taking the threat of these weapons seriously, and offers a framework for Europe's response to Iran and North Korea. You made Justice and Home Affairs the centrepiece of your presidency programme. Much has been achieved, though justice and freedom still play second fiddle to security, to the European Union's discredit. Commitments to further progress on legal migration and the integration of third country nationals are a fitting riposte to those who sought to repeat in Thessaloniki the kind of headlines which shamed Seville. However, my group regrets that you did not provide for proper parliamentary scrutiny, at European or national level, of the recent EU-US extradition agreement. On economic reform the Hellenic Presidency has made good progress, notably reforming the Stability Pact to target underlying deficits, concluding the energy liberalisation package and adopting the much-needed pensions directive. All in all, this has been a profitable six months for the European Union, despite the huge costs of war and the difficult economic position. Let us hope that, as you hand the baton to your successors, they too will run hard to keep up the Olympian lead that you have established. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I too thank all those who have represented this House on the Convention. It is said that ‘success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan’. The draft Constitution agreed by the Convention last Friday is blessed with many proud parents. Of these, the European Parliament can claim more than its fair share of paternity, since we led the calls for the Convention method to be used to avoid a repeat of the failures of Nice. We owe much to the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, which gave us the visionary Laeken Declaration. While the birth was difficult and the baby is not as pretty as we hoped, the European Constitution born on Friday 13 June 2003 deserves a long and fruitful life. Liberals everywhere will rejoice that fundamental rights now lie at the heart of the Union's basic law. We welcome the establishment of a single legal personality for the Union, the unification of the pillars and the extension of democratic control by the European Parliament. Crucially, this shorter and simpler treaty should also be more accessible to Europe's citizens since it sets out more clearly who does what. Of course we would have liked to go further in some respects. We hope that the post of Chairman of the European Council will in time be merged with that of Commission President in an integrated Presidency. We want to see the legitimacy of the Commission strengthened by a real election of its President by the European Parliament. We seek a greater role for regions with constitutional powers. And we would like greater recourse to majority voting, even in a sensitive area like foreign policy, so that the Union can act more decisively abroad. There is still work to be done. The extension of qualified majority voting needs to be given concrete expression in the policies in part 3 of the constitution. We also urge the Convention to be ambitious in creating a lighter procedure for amending part 3, through voting by super-qualified majority and without recourse to national ratification. At Thessaloniki, the Heads of State and Government will be granted custody of the new-born constitution and will bring it to maturity in the Intergovernmental Conference. Having been so central to its conception, our governments will not be able to disown the constitution lightly. The European Council will have to decide the composition and the duration of the IGC. The parliamentary component of the Convention must be fairly represented at the talks – as you, Mr President, have said. Since members of the Liberal caucus under my colleague Andrew Duff have made such a great contribution to the work of the Convention, we insist that Parliament's representation should reflect this. On the length of the IGC, if Member States seek to unpick one part of the deal, others will pull at it too and the whole fabric risks unravelling. For that reason, we urge that the IGC be kept short and stick to the essentials of the text agreed by the Convention. This brings me to my final point. The most open and democratic institutional reform in our Union's history deserves to be brought to a fitting conclusion. It is no use making the EU simpler and more accountable if politicians do not then explain it and argue the case for active engagement in Europe Speaking personally, I hope that my own government will at last shake off its reticence and take the case for Britain's membership of this refounded European Union to the people in a referendum. Whether they ratify by way of referendum or parliamentary debate, I hope that other countries too will seize the opportunity to have a great debate with their voters. That way, our people can again feel ownership of the European project. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, European Liberal Democrats in this House hope that President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing will present to the Heads of State and Government a draft Constitutional Treaty which commands a broad consensus. It must dampen the fires of the increasingly bitter disputes we have witnessed in recent weeks. However, it is for the Convention, not its President, to confirm the existence or not of a consensus, and if the Convention needs a little more time to complete its work, so be it. Mr Giscard d'Estaing likes to say that his Constitution will last unchanged for 50 years, but unless a durable consensus is reflected in the final text and Member States are given the time to debate it we are likely to have to revisit the matter in the very near future. The latest proposals provide hope that the Praesidium is now in listening mode, but there is clearly still much listening to do. Even with the restrictions on his role in foreign policy, European Liberal Democrats remain unconvinced of the case for a full-time chairman of the European Council. We are suspicious that the larger Member States seek to unpick the seams of the Community fabric. A double-hatted approach for Europe's new Foreign Minister commands widespread support, so why not take the same approach and integrate the roles of European Commission and European Council Presidents? Must we risk years of conflict, of turf wars, of duplication of effort before we recognise the sense of this approach? At the very least we must leave open the door to an integrated presidency in a few years time. President Prodi spoke – and I have sympathy with much that he said – of the national veto. In the name of preserving national sovereignty, the veto all too often promotes international anarchy. Unless we are capable of thinking in new ways about the concept of sovereignty, we will continue to fail our citizens on the major challenges we face. While I welcome the proposed extension of Parliament's powers of democratic control over the budget and European legislation, I am concerned that an imbalance remains between the powers of Parliament and Council in other areas, such as concluding agreements with third countries on crucial security matters. Mr President-in-Office, another item on your agenda in Thessaloniki will be the debate on High Representative Solana's recommendations for an overall strategy in foreign and security policy. It is vital for the European Union to develop a doctrine which enshrines the central role of international law and of institutions such as the UN, the WTO and NATO. Europe also urgently needs a framework for deciding under which conditions we should commit troops to military action, including conflict prevention, peace enforcement and humanitarian crises. Congo is a welcome step forward but our current embarrassment over Bosnia-Herzegovina is a setback. And to prevent the European Union fracturing again as it did over Iraq, we need to start debating and planning now our approach to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I hope that the summit will discuss Europe's approach to North Korea and Iran and not leave it until a crisis erupts. In the area of Justice and Home Affairs, I commend the President-in-Office for the progress made thus far under Greece's stewardship. I hope that you will continue to seek to balance repressive measures against illegal immigration with a generous approach to refugees and an emphasis on human rights and fundamental freedoms. I would also appeal to the President-in-Office to make every effort to conclude three important proposals concerning third-country nationals who are long-term residents, minimum standards for qualifying for refugee status and minimum standards for the granting of such status. Mr President-in-Office, you touched on the subject of a Members' Statute. I fear that the proposal we adopted yesterday will not make your work any easier, but I hope you will be guided in this, as in other matters on your agenda, by the advice of your philosopher, Socrates: remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs, therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue depression in adversity. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I know that a number of Members of the House had wished to have a discussion with the Convention President in advance of Thessaloniki but he clearly is not going to come, so I support Mr Barón Crespo's suggestion that you put this item on the agenda of the Conference of Presidents on Thursday.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, although many of us opposed the basis for the recent war with Iraq, we can unite in rejoicing at the fall of the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people can now rebuild their country as a free democracy, at peace with its neighbours and using its immense natural resources to raise the standard of living. The question for Europe today is how to unite in rebuilding Iraq so that we can overcome our previous division. We must project Europe's voice with the unity of a choir singing from the same hymn sheet, rather than the dissonance of an unruly cacophony. The informal meeting of foreign ministers leaves me cautiously optimistic. I welcome the proposals from the Commission and the Greek Presidency to guide our action in post-war Iraq. While we may not yet have the capacity to wage war in defence of our values, we have long experience at winning the peace. My group favours an active role for Europe in rebuilding Iraq, but for that we need the legitimacy which can come only from another UN resolution. We were promised a 'vital' role for the UN by President Bush. Our foreign ministers have demanded a 'central' role for the United Nations. Yet the draft resolution of the US, the UK and Spain falls far short of either. You cannot give a vital role to the UN simply by proclaiming it in a recital to a Security Council resolution. A vital role means that rebuilding Iraq would not be not possible without the UN; it entails not endorsing for a 12-month period the authority of the self-declared occupying powers, with the right to direct the disbursement of funds from Iraqi oil revenues. A vital role for the UN means its involvement in setting up, as soon as possible, a legitimate and representative government of Iraqis, in lifting sanctions and in providing urgent humanitarian aid. Why have running water and electricity not yet been restored? How many must die before we get medical supplies into hospitals and clean up the unexploded ordnance? Where are the police that the UN could send to help restore law and order? We need to give the people of Iraq a better life or their hardship will become anger towards the occupying powers. A vital or central role for the UN also means readmitting Hans Blix and his weapons inspectors to verify what has happened to the weapons of mass destruction which remain unaccounted for. Their existence and the claim that they could be used within 45 minutes were central to the case for war. The weapons inspectors have the international legitimacy and credibility to complete the job they were asked to do, in cooperation with American and British forces on the ground. The tragic events of Monday night in Saudi Arabia remind us of the continuing instability in the region. That is why my group welcomes the visit of Colin Powell, marking the re-engagement of the United States in the peace process. For lasting peace in the region and a successful rebuilding of Iraq, we must simultaneously take forward the Quartet's roadmap for peace in Israel and Palestine. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, 18 months ago when I had the honour to serve as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this House adopted a resolution on judicial cooperation between the Union and the USA. That resolution set out four key requirements for any extradition agreement: full respect for the European Convention on Human Rights; no extradition of persons likely to face military tribunals; no extradition if the accused risks facing the death penalty; and that any measures affecting data protection should be proportionate, effective and time-limited. The terrorist outrages in Saudi Arabia on Monday night once again remind us that terrorism still poses a deadly serious threat. We need a robust and effective response. However, the Liberal Democrats in this House insist that anti-terrorism measures must always respect fundamental rights and be subject to proper democratic oversight and control. Striking the right balance is essential to success in fighting those who seek to undermine the fabric of democratic societies. The current draft agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and legal cooperation must not escape the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in our Treaties. They concern 'fundamental choices' within the meaning of Article 21. They fall not only under Article 38 but also under Article 24, and it is scandalous that the Council does not consult this House in advance on all the Article 24 agreements. In France, the Conseil d'Etat
 has refused the Assemblée Nationale
 the right to approve such agreements: so unless the Council consults us, what parliamentary scrutiny exists in the European Union? These agreements on extradition and legal co-operation are very ambitious. The United States declines to sign the UN conventions on cybercrime, on crime prevention and on the International Criminal Court. In the Union, Member States have not yet ratified our decision on money laundering or the framework directive on terrorism. Yet these proposals cover the whole Palermo agenda. They should at the very least provide for the establishment of bodies to oversee their operation and provide feedback. I can only regret that this agreement makes no reference to the International Criminal Court. I would urge the Council to rectify this. The Council must seek to reconcile the potential conflict between a request from the ICC to surrender a person to the court and the obligation stemming from this extradition agreement. The slide away from democracy can start with the best of intentions. The European Union must guard against it. Do not let the Council's haste facilitate it.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, it is a practice both in trade union and in other negotiations to use one's strength at a time when it is calculated to cause the most difficulty for those with whom one is in dispute. But in Parliament we rarely have days or votes of such significance as today. The action being threatened by the unions does not reflect fairly the mutual respect which exists within the House between the different partners, or indeed the good relations that we have generally enjoyed. You are right to proceed with our business and I would appeal to the staff of the House to assist us in carrying through today's historic task with the maximum goodwill on their part. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I apologise to Mr Morillon for not being here when he opened the debate. This report could hardly be more timely. If – as seems likely – US and British Forces are now in control of Baghdad, then the debate on the aftermath of war and its lessons can now commence. Unlike its predecessors, the current American administration shows little interest in a strong and united Europe. Our weakness has been cruelly exposed and the onus is on the EU to develop a security strategy which may help us reshape transatlantic relations. Liberal Democrats in this House welcome the Morillon report as an important contribution to this process. Europe's divisions over Iraq have been a stark reminder of our failure to speak with one voice on security policy, and yet we should not forget that Europe does have a single trade policy, a common development policy and an embryonic European diplomatic corps in the form of the Commission's offices around the world. These are powerful instruments and would be all the more so if combined as part of an integrated foreign policy. Our foreign policy is incoherent because it is split between three Commissioners, the Council presidency and a Council High Representative, and because some Member States deny our essential commonality of interests in foreign policy, or forbid the Commission to play a central executive role. Without a common defence policy, Europe will still lack the military muscle needed for a credible common foreign policy. With combined defence spending less than half of that of the USA, it is clear the EU is not spending enough on defence, nor would our citizens be likely to welcome much higher levels of spending. So it is not enough simply to spend more: we need to spend better, especially on key requirements such as strategic airlift, precision guided weapons and air tankers. That is why the Liberal Group supports the establishment of an armaments and research agency to coordinate defence spending. What we want is to achieve better value for money, and if EU countries agree that military equipment made outside the EU best meets our needs and provides best value for money, we should not choose a European option in a misguided attempt at protectionism. That would be to repeat the mistakes of the common agricultural policy. Better defence spending must be accompanied by stronger decision-making. By sending to the European Convention, through General Morillon's report, a clear and united message in favour of a strong and effective security and defence policy, Parliament can hope to influence its deliberations. Having one external affairs representative, based in the Commission but supplemented with resources and expertise from the Member States, will go a long way towards connecting the disparate elements of foreign and security policy. We also need greater flexibility in launching and conducting crisis management operations, if necessary by greater recourse to constructive abstention. While there are clearly reservations about this, introducing a collective defence clause in the new Constitutional Treaty, similar to that under the Western European Union Treaty, also seems a necessary step. It may be that progress towards these goals cannot be made at once with the 15, let alone with 25 Member States. That is why I welcome the Belgian Government's initiative for a meeting later this month with France, Germany and Luxembourg, on defence policy. Progress in European integration is often only achieved by a group of determined countries pressing ahead, with others joining later. Nonetheless I insist that enhanced cooperation on defence must remain open to all governments who wish to join, and that the British Government in particular, given its military capability and experience, will do so. In conclusion, a European security and defence policy can usefully complement the collective security provided by NATO as long as there is rationalisation of arms procurement, added value in the form of a doctrine based on conflict prevention and crisis management and backed by the credible threat of military action, and a more coherent and unified approach to security policy. Let our security and defence policy be forged on the anvil of hope from the steel of our embarrassment over Iraq.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, the war with Iraq inevitably overshadowed the Council's important economic reform agenda. It is only natural that, at such a time, economic issues should take second place to matters of life and death. However, given the negative economic impact that the conflict could have on the Union's economy, we must not take our eyes off the ball and let the economic reforms that are needed to revitalise our economy fall further behind. So before turning to the conflict with Iraq, I will say a few words about economic reform. The truth is that the process of economic reform is running into the sand; with the European Union set to enlarge to 25 countries, we will have to run just to stand still. I should like to cite just three examples. First, at 1.9% of GDP, our investment in research and development is well below levels in the USA and Japan, and with only two of the accession countries spending more than 1% of GDP on research and development, we will be hard pressed to reach the 3% Lisbon target by 2010. My second example is taken from the Barcelona Council, where Europe's leaders committed themselves to cutting the percentage of single market laws not yet implemented to less than 1.5% – instead, the proportion rose last year to over 2%. As the incoming Member States will naturally face some teething problems in implementing law in the early years, this implementation deficit is in danger of growing further if we do not redouble our efforts. Progress will certainly not be achieved if others emulate the tactics used by Mr Berlusconi in his shameful attempt to defend illegal milk subsidies at the expense of a deal on the taxation of savings. That hardly augurs well for the Italian presidency. And third: raising levels of employment. It is impressive that we managed to create half a million jobs last year despite the economic slowdown. But the scale of the task ahead becomes clear when we note that unemployment in the EU as a whole rose last year to nearly 8%. On the issue of jobs, the Council appears to have followed the age-old practice: ‘If in doubt, create a task force’. I wish Wim Kok well in his work, but it is hard to see what answers he can come up with which are better than the tried and trusted recipe of reducing the burden of taxes on labour and increasing market flexibility. On Iraq, I welcome the forward-looking nature of the European Council conclusions, brokered by the President-in-Office, and their focus on humanitarian assistance, on rebuilding Iraq and the central role to be played in this by the United Nations. Humanitarian aid must get through. We see from the situation in Basra just how important that is. The horror transmitted through our television screens shows us just how necessary it is to get our relief agencies in and working. I welcome Mr Prodi's proposal for EUR 3 million of immediate humanitarian aid through the Red Cross. Liberal Democrats will support the rapid approval by our House of your request for the release of a further EUR 70 million from the emergency budget reserve. The EU has been damaged by the divisions of recent weeks. This could presage a new effort to heal the political wounds, but it is hard not to agree with the Luxembourg Prime Minister when he says that problems cannot be resolved unless they are discussed. I agree with the Council that we need to strengthen transatlantic relations. Our dialogue must be extended to cover reform of the United Nations and the role of international law, but the United States must accept that nothing durable can be established without institutions and rules. My group also welcomes Belgium's proposal for a ministerial meeting on North Korea. If the situation in Iraq had been discussed at the Seville Summit – as Mr Verhofstadt proposed – we might not be at sixes and sevens today. We must wait and see whether 2003 is an annus mirabilis
 or an annus horribilis
 for the European Union, but since we are now in the Year of the Goat, I would congratulate the Greek Presidency on its tenacity, persistence and determination in pushing through its agenda. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, this is not a just war. Liberal Democrats have consistently argued in this House that war would be justified only as a last resort, if inspections had failed and if it were explicitly authorised by the UN Security Council. We prefer the force of argument to the argument of force. Nonetheless, much as we abhor Saddam Hussein's regime, we deeply regret that as we breakfasted in Brussels the bombs were falling on Baghdad. I hope, for the sake of the Iraqi people and for the sake of our troops doing their duty as professional soldiers, that this war will be as swift and as bloodless as possible. In the absence of UN legitimacy and moral authority there is a duty on the countries prosecuting this war to do so in a way that is consistent with international norms and conventions. That means not using disproportionate force, not using the cluster bombs that drop small mines around the place, not using the incapacitating gas such as that used in the theatre in Moscow, not using the devastating MOAB bomb where air burst and mushroom clouds caused mass destruction. They might also take care not to litter the Iraqi desert with depleted uranium. (Applause from the ELDR Group)
 Once this war is over it will be imperative that the United States and the United Kingdom shoulder their responsibilities in rebuilding rapidly a peaceful, stable and prosperous Iraq for the inhabitants who have suffered so terribly under our sanctions regime. This will require the lifting of sanctions and immediate humanitarian aid. It means uniting the different communities of Iraq and the building of stable institutions to secure the future. Beyond that, they also need to establish a criminal tribunal for the crimes of the Iraqi regime and they must give back control of the oil fields to the Iraqi people. If those countries can bring the same conviction and determination to the solution of the Israeli-Palestine conflict and the same zeal to eliminating their own weapons of mass destruction, as they demand of the Iraqis, then we might make progress. It is important that the US does not act unilaterally in deciding the fate of Iraq. Once this war is over, the European Union must be a standard bearer for humanitarian values. We must be broadminded and generous and assume fully our responsibilities in the rebuilding of Iraq. This is not the moment to haggle with the USA over the cost of reconstruction. Europe must play its part with no hidden agenda. As our heads of state and government meet this weekend they must discuss how we can limit the economic fallout of the war for Europe's economy, how the ECB can stand ready to act swiftly to restore confidence in our currency if needed, and how governments can show a renewed commitment to the reforms needed to revive Europe's economy. They must also discuss, and be prepared to discuss when the crisis is over, why Europe has failed over Iraq. It could yet be that this crisis will prove a turning point if our heads of state and government finally accept the need for a common foreign policy and a single EU seat at the UN Security Council, because Europe's troubled tribalism means that Washington wins the day. If there is a lesson to be learned from this crisis in London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid, it is that if we had a common foreign and security policy our world view would prevail. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, an eminent and noble friend of mine recounts how he became convinced of the need for regime change in Iraq when during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Iraqi soldiers put Kuwaiti prisoners of war into manholes, closed the covers, poured petrol through the air vents and set them alight. Few can be unaware of the barbarity of Saddam Hussein's regime, either towards his own citizens or towards others, and for that reason I applaud the initiative of my friend and colleague, Mr Rutelli, in seeking to establish an international criminal tribunal for Iraq. Iraq has been under notice from the international community for over a decade and our patience on the issue of disarmament is running very thin. For Liberals in this House good relations between Europe and the United States of America are of huge importance. Our commitment to shared values, our commitment to economic and cultural ties reflected in our military alliance are things that we hold dear. We share America's pain about the attacks of 11 September, and not just because European citizens were among those so brutally murdered. But we do not share the US President's view that war against Iraq is justified at this stage. The report presented by Hans Blix to the UN Security Council last Friday does not make a case for immediate military action. On the contrary, he reported substantial disarmament and, while he recognised that cooperation was by no means immediate, he welcomed it as active, even proactive. His report showed that inspections are delivering tangible results for the weapons inspectors, sufficient to be given the additional months needed to complete Iraqi disarmament. To pull the rug from under Hans Blix's feet and resort to war now, would be incomprehensible to moderate opinion around the world. I would ask our American friends to pause and reflect, if only for a few minutes, on some fundamental questions. Will a regime change in Iraq help bring to justice Al-Qaeda terrorists? Will upheaval in a secular Arab state advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine? And would not the cost of continued vigilance, resilience and patience be lower than the cost of war and reconstruction? We must not underestimate the casualties of war, and not only the human casualties, though they would be many and costly, but the diplomatic casualties of which the collapse of the reconciliation talks in Cyprus is perhaps the first. As the crisis unfolds we are also approaching a critical moment for the future credibility of the United Nations and a world order based on the rule of law. The remarkable unity displayed by the international community last November in agreeing unanimously to Resolution 1441 is in danger of falling apart. We are witnessing the unedifying sight of the pro- and anti-war factions in the Security Council seeking to win over the undecided countries through bullying, bribery and even blackmail. The dignity and integrity of the United Nations is at stake. Having gone down the UN route to achieve Iraqi disarmament, a decision which my group warmly welcomed at the time, the United States must stick with the multilateral route. For the US to disregard a UN decision against early military action would deal a potentially fatal blow to the United Nations. It does not matter whether this decision is reached because of the failure to muster the required nine votes or because of a French or Russian veto. A veto one opposes will always be less reasonable than a veto one imposes. Yet rules are rules, and UN backing for military action must not be circumvented on the grounds that a veto is 'unreasonable'. It would be far better for any vote on a new resolution to be postponed until a consensual outcome can be achieved. The elements of a consensus can be readily identified, if only the artificial demands of a pre-determined military timetable could be set aside. Mr President-in-Office, you have told us that war can still be avoided. The gates of the Temple of Janus have been unlocked, if not yet opened. Hans Blix has set out the disarmament tasks which remain to be achieved and these tasks could be set out in a new resolution as clearly defined benchmarks to be met by Iraq in the coming months. Recognising that Iraq has only moved as far as it has because of the threat of military force, why not keep up the pressure until the process is completed? If Saddam Hussein fails to meet the benchmarks in the resolution, then the diplomatic and inspections options will have been exhausted and the international community would have the moral authority and legitimacy to resort to war. In conclusion, it is claimed in London, Washington and Madrid that war could be short, swift and successful. With UN support this could indeed be the case, but without it, in a conflict which divides the international community, we could be on the brink of another Hundred Years War which could bring down regimes well beyond Iraq.

 – Mr President, it is an honour to be attacked by one of the Conservative Party's young Turks. (Mixed reactions)
 I gave the House information which I believed to be correct. In fact I said to the House that I 'understood' that Mr Muis was going to be at the committee meeting, but I am pleased that later on in that debate the Chairman of the committee herself said that she was unaware Mr Muis was going to be there, so the House was in no way misled. Had I had different information, I would have communicated it.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, my group believes that this amendment should not fall even if Amendment No 24 is adopted.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, it is important that we, as a House, are not rushed into precipitate action by the activities of a few journalists. As I understand it, this supposed story relates to a memo dated 21 May 2002. The reform process has come a long way since then, under the watchful eye of our Committee on Budgetary Control, which Mr Kinnock will no doubt address on this issue. It seems to us that, taking into consideration the Casaca report which has dealt with many of these issues and the contributions to it, the matter is in fact being dealt with. I understand that the author of the memo referred to, Mr Muis, is due to attend the Committee on Budgetary Control meeting this week and I suggest that members of that committee ask him whether he would write the same kind of memo today as he wrote in May of last year. It would seem that the process has come a long way forward and this is probably a storm in a teacup. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I am sorry to rise to speak against my successor on an issue like this, but it seems to me that, just as we rightly ask the Committee on Budgetary Control to look at the allegations about the reform process that have been raised in some newspapers over the weekend, we should also ask the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to look urgently at this matter. What is at stake here is the possibility of the Americans coming back to us with a request for access to databases on European airline passengers which would ride roughshod over our own data protection legislation and indeed could form a major intrusion into the civil liberties of European citizens. It seems to me that, if the House does not take a position this week, then we are impotent. We ought to be stressing very strongly our opposition to what the Americans are requesting and our opposition to any potential agreement by the Commission to such a request. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I congratulate the President-in-Office on his speech and wish him well with his agenda. Mr Prodi has outlined the scale of the challenges we face and the measures that are needed; yet it seems to me that if the Union's backbone were as strong as its wishbone this debate might not be necessary. The list of unresolved economic reform issues on the agenda for the Spring Council makes depressingly familiar reading. A year ago, ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which one government dubbed the 'make or break summit' for economic reform, the Union was deadlocked over fundamental issues such as the Community Patent, the Take-over Bids Directive and the Pensions Directive. Ministers were at sixes and sevens over the Stability Pact, having failed to issue early warnings to Germany and Portugal. Resolving these issues was proclaimed to be the foremost objective of the heads of state and government. So how much progress have we made, one year on? On the Community Patent, which Mr Prodi mentioned - no progress. The best gloss that you can put on the new Take-over Bids Directive is that it is 'a work in progress'. Far from improving the situation, the Pensions Directive could actually represent a step backwards if adopted in the form currently advocated by Parliament's rapporteur. And Germany and Portugal have since been joined by France in the rogues' gallery of countries which are falling foul of the Stability Pact. In the midst of this litany of failure, in step Messrs Blair, Chirac and Schröder with another depressing example of letterbox diplomacy. After highlighting Europe's divisions on Iraq with the 'gang of 8' letter, the UK's Prime Minister has now formed a terrible trio of leaders with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder, who presume to tell other leaders how to reform their economies while blocking economic progress themselves. To hear a clarion call for economic reform from a British Prime Minister whose continued indecision over joining the euro is hitting jobs, growth and investment, is more than a little galling. For the President of France to put his name to a letter calling for the rapid completion of the internal market, when France tops the charts for failure to implement single market legislation, is little short of breathtaking. And to be lectured on the need for Europe to reform labour markets and increase employment by a Chancellor who has presided over record levels of unemployment in Germany, really takes the biscuit. Perhaps a little humility from those three leaders is called for when it comes to economic reform. We are in the third year of the ten-year Lisbon plan to improve competitiveness. The truth is that progress has been disappointing. The keys to higher employment levels and sustainable growth lie in sound public finances, a dynamic private sector, the completion of the single market, a real European research area and incentives for work, skill and innovation. My group would emphasise in particular the importance of completing the financial services action plan, fostering entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility and adaptability in the labour market. We must also increase the participation of women, immigrants, older workers and disabled people in the labour market, and adapt tax and benefit systems to make work pay. These are the challenges we face and we have only seven years left it we are to achieve our goal of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world. Instead of setting new bold targets, the heads of state and government should get on with the job of closing the existing 'delivery gap' between their words and their actions.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, it seems hard to believe that the disunity of the world community as a whole, and the European Union in particular, could reach a lower point than when the 'gang of 8' prime ministers signed their ill-judged letter backing the USA on Iraq. But we are now plumbing new depths of public bickering, with the splits spreading from the UN and the EU to include Nato. Anarchy reigns in our international institutions, and that only provides comfort to Saddam Hussein. If we are to prevent these fissures becoming a chasm, our governments must draw back from their quarrels, return to first principles and move forward on the basis of what unites them. The United Nations, Nato, the European Communities – these institutions have served us well, and they are too valuable to be abandoned in the face of current differences of approach. And if that requires America to show a little patience, that is no bad thing. Public opinion in the US is less united than President Bush pretends – over a third still want a new UN vote to authorise any conflict, and almost a quarter do not want US troops to be sent to Iraq at all. When a former president pleads for patience, and leading Democrat Senator John Kerry hopes for an America: 'where military might is not clouded by our need for oil', is there really bipartisan backing for President Bush, to give him the credibility he needs? Democracy can be difficult, and building support for a position often takes time and good arguments. But it is better to take the time to do it and get it right than to launch into a course of action, half cock. Liberals therefore congratulate the Greek Presidency on convening next Monday's meeting. We trust that all governments will attend. They should come prepared to listen and to seek common ground, not simply to repeat their well-known positions. Europe's leaders too should take care not to overplay their hand. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees is rightly following the maxim that they should prepare for the worst while continuing to hope for the best, by making contingency plans for a possible refugee crisis. As a collective defence organisation, Nato should be guided by the same principle, and it is the responsibility of every Nato country to support Turkey's request for assistance under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Given the reservations he expressed last time, Dr Hans Blix's report on Friday will carry particular significance. Those who call for more inspectors should heed his remark that: 'the principal problem is not the number of inspectors but rather the active cooperation of the Iraqi side'. At the same time, if he reports progress towards active cooperation, the US and Britain should give the UN process the space to work. Amid all this gloom, perhaps we can take comfort from one ray of hope. When the inspectors report again on Friday, the eyes of the world will again be focused on the UN Security Council. It will be the body which represents the ultimate authority of the international community and considers Iraq's fate. We should welcome the fact that the UN, established to preserve world peace, is at the heart of the process. Let us keep it there. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, with four Member States on the UN Security Council, including the chair, the EU should have the opportunity for real influence over current events and it would if it spoke with one voice. I wonder if Mr Solana would confirm that the meeting of four Security Council members, convened by the Greek Presidency ahead of Monday's General Affairs Council, was intended to achieve a single EU position? Will such meetings become regular events? Or was it simply an attempt to stitch up the outcome of the Council without consulting the remaining Member States? Perhaps I could also ask whether, in the regrettable absence of a coherent EU strategy in the run-up to a possible conflict with Iraq, he would undertake to ensure that the EU starts work now to plan a post-conflict strategy in the region? When we last debated the situation in Iraq in early September, the world seemed on the brink of a unilateral military adventure led by the United States. Our main concerns then were to prevent the credibility of the United Nations and of international law being undermined by a pre-emptive strike not authorised by the UN, and to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq. We may be the old continent but we remember our yesterdays rather well and our experience of war has been very different from that of the USA. In the event, the United States did go the UN route last autumn, and secured a unanimous vote for a tough Security Council resolution. The UN weapons inspectors have been readmitted to Iraq and are doing a professional and thorough job. So we Liberals salute the efforts of Colin Powell, Hans Blix, Mohamed Elbaradei and others for reinforcing the multilateral rule of law. Now that we are engaged on the proper path of international cooperation, we must make every effort to preserve that unity. However, following the presentation of Dr Blix's report to the Security Council, there is a new danger – a danger that the credibility of the UN and international law risks being undermined, not by unilateral US action, but by the failure of the international community to ensure that Iraq rids itself of weapons of mass destruction once and for all. Dr Blix's report to the UN provides a damning if not yet conclusive account of Iraq's failure to cooperate fully with the UN weapons inspectors. Saddam Hussein is required by UN resolution 1441 to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Instead, we have seen half-truths, prevarication and evasion. Dr Blix has opened the case for the prosecution with powerful arguments, though the evidence he has presented does not yet provide proof beyond all reasonable doubt. That is why Liberals in this House insist that the inspectors be allowed to continue their work. Dr Blix raises many disturbing questions in his report. Saddam Hussein clearly has a case to answer. A peaceful resolution to the crisis is still possible provided that Iraq now demonstrates a real willingness to cooperate with the UN in disarming. But with the inspectors due to report again on 14 February, there is little time left to him before the court of the international community has to reach a verdict. For Liberals, war will always be a last resort; recourse to military action means that the instruments of international governance in which we invest such high hopes have failed. But equally, the international community has to stand ready to enforce its will, or the rule of law will be flouted. And there is plenty of evidence that Saddam Hussein is in breach of international law, most notably of the UN Convention on Genocide for the murder of half a million marsh Arabs. So let us forget talk of allowing Saddam Hussein to slip off quietly into the night for a comfortable exile in a third country. He is a war criminal and he must be brought before the International Criminal Court. To those Members who intend to convey to Saddam Hussein the message that impunity in exile is an acceptable way out, I say, to borrow the phrase of the anti-war coalition: not in our name. And I invite them to search their consciences. Is the best way to advance the cause of peace really to travel to Baghdad for a photo opportunity and risk being manipulated by the Iraqi regime? Dr Blix told us yesterday that if Iraq chooses to cooperate, the inspectors can complete their work very soon. The inspectors must be given more time but if Dr Blix reports on 14 February that Iraq has failed to provide answers to his questions, and if the Security Council therefore determines that they are in material breach of the resolution, then the international community has a responsibility to act. If Iraq does not seize this final opportunity to cooperate, we must act together through the UN to enforce resolution 1441.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I have heard it said that there is nothing left for the Greek Presidency, other than providing the after-sales service for Copenhagen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Greek Presidency will have a key role in the birth of a reformed and enlarged European Union. But to ensure a smooth birth a good midwife is essential and I am pleased to see that the Greek Presidency seems well prepared to play that role. With regard to the reform of the Union, the Convention is due to report in Thessaloniki. As every good midwife knows, it is important to keep pushy relatives out of the delivery room and while the discussions in the Elysée Palace tonight will be important, they must not dictate the outcome of that Convention. It is also important to ensure that the baby is not strangled at birth by Member States fearful of an ambitious constitutional Treaty. I would therefore take issue with the President-in-Office and say we should not have a lengthy interim period. We need a short IGC, which should be a tidying-up exercise to ratify quickly the outcome of the Convention quickly. 2003 will be the year when politicians must sell enlargement to the voters. Nine out of ten of the new countries will have referenda between March and September this year. We need to put far more effort into making the case for a 'yes' vote in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe than we have put recently into convincing citizens in our current Union that Europe is a 'good thing'. Liberal Democrats in this House and beyond are committed to campaigning in the new countries to make sure that we get a 'yes' vote and we call on others to join us. We hope in particular that the Greek Presidency can use its privileged relationship with many on the island of Cyprus to ensure that a united island joins our Union. Time is short, but recent developments, both on the island and in Ankara, have created a window of opportunity and I hope that you, Mr President-in-Office, will work with all parties to craft a compromise. I welcome the generous aspirations that you have expressed today in that regard. If the European Union is to succeed, however, for its current citizens and its new ones, it will need reform. As we approach the third anniversary of the ten-year Lisbon strategy, it has to be said that progress to date on productivity, growth, employment, investment, research and development has been disappointing. The continued economic slow-down is making structural reform more, not less, urgent and governments should not be deflected from the goals they set themselves. It will be important for the presidency to reaffirm commitment to a reformed Stability Pact, to focus on the underlying deficit, to give the Commission the power to issue early warnings to countries in danger. It will also need to stick to the timetable for the Financial Services Action Plan, which has already shown dangerous slippage, and to secure approval of the takeover bids directive. If you want someone to help you along this path, why not give the European Parliament more of a role in the follow-up to the decisions of the Spring Councils, in holding the Council accountable for the decisions that are taken? That is something we would do very well. Europe is of course though far more than a common market and your presidency recognises this. The Amsterdam and Nice Treaties have created a Community of values. I welcome the emphasis in your presidency's statement on the values of a generous, outward-looking and civilised society. You speak in your document of a planned legal immigration policy. Exposed as you are on Europe's southern and eastern flanks, you see the importance of understanding a little more and condemning a little less. The fact is that, as long as we keep out their produce and deprive them of the hope of economic development, we will take the people of the developing countries to the south and the east. We need many of them to deal with the problems of an ageing population here, or the brain drain problems the Commission President referred to. Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society. I had a great deal to say about Iraq and the Middle East peace process as well, but my time is running short. I would, however, say that the Greeks are well acquainted with what we in the rest of Europe understand by the word 'marathon'. You take the baton from the last runner, Denmark, and try and cover as much ground as possible as quickly as possible, before handing it over to the next presidency. We wish you good speed in the marathon that you are running on our behalf. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I am grateful to have the opportunity to respond at the end of the debate. Members have raised very interesting points. I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will have taken careful note and will be keen to take on board as many of them as he can. Until recently relations between Parliament and the Council were not extensive, but a combination of an increase in the powers of this House and the prospect of an increase in the number of Member States has had the effect of bringing our two institutions much closer together. On behalf of the Liberal Group I welcome this closer working relationship between Parliament and the Council. We see it very publicly, particularly in the Convention, and also in the number of very successful negotiations through the codecision process. I welcome the approach taken, first by the Danish Presidency and now continued by the Greek Presidency, to much closer working relations with this House, shown in the President-in-Office's concern that a statute for Members should form part of the successful reform of the European Union institutions. We look forward to working closely with you.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I am delighted with the support we have received from Mr Barón Crespo and the PSE Group. I can assure you that my group is deeply concerned about the situation in Chechnya and it is something which must command the attention of this House. However, it is something on which we have frequently expressed ourselves and there is no particular urgency. The action of the Governor of the State of Illinois in the United States is something we very much welcome. The position of this House, over many years, on this issue has been so consistent that we should take this opportunity to welcome what has happened, and indeed we should call on the 38 remaining states in the United States of America which still apply the death penalty to follow the example set in Illinois. It is for that reason that we maintain our request for an urgency on this subject.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on the successful conclusion in Copenhagen of an outstanding Danish presidency. It is rare in my experience for a presidency to receive such wide praise from all sides of this House. The improvement in relations between the Council and Parliament has been notable, and we owe much in this regard to the role of our former, much-esteemed colleague, Mr Haarder. The outcome of the summit is a tribute to the negotiating skills of Mr Fogh Rasmussen and the persistence both he and his team displayed. Their decision to focus single-mindedly on enlargement paid off handsomely: Europe can now reunite. However, we must not be complacent. The full application of the Copenhagen criteria, both in the new countries and in the existing Member States, must remain a matter of concern. Moreover, there are referenda to be won in all the new countries – referenda in which each and every one of us can play an important part, if we so choose. Copenhagen offers Bulgaria and Romania the prospect of greater pre-accession aid and the objective of membership in 2007. While these two countries will clearly be in the next wave of enlargement, we should continue to be guided by the principle that each candidate will be judged on its own merits. Liberal Democrats would have preferred an earlier review of Turkey's readiness for accession. However, Turkey is clearly now on the path to membership and, if the Copenhagen criteria are met by the end of 2004, my group will hold the governments to their commitment to open membership negotiations. An agreement on the United Nations plan to reunite Cyprus would have been the icing on the cake of the Copenhagen Council. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic that agreement can be reached so that a united Cyprus can sign the Accession Treaty in April 2004. We hope that Turkey will seize the opportunity to confirm its European vocation by putting pressure on Mr Denktash to reach a compromise. However, celebrations over the historic decision to reunite Europe – and I welcome the very prominent role played by Liberals in the Council, Commission and Parliament, whether those on the benches in front of us apply that label to themselves or not – should not be allowed to overshadow another significant breakthrough at Copenhagen. That was the agreement with Turkey to allow the EU's Rapid Reaction Force to go ahead and have access to Nato's resources. Europe's security and defence ambitions can now be put to the test as the EU takes over Operation Amber Fox in Macedonia. This may pave the way for more ambitious missions in the future, including peace-enforcement operations in accordance with the UN Charter. A wider Europe must be prepared to shoulder its responsibilities in the world, whether in the Middle East – I congratulate the Council on its firm declaration on that conflict – or elsewhere. We must be a bulwark for freedom and democracy and a force for justice. In building that strength, we owe much to Denmark. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

rapporteur
. – Mr President, we have spoken much in recent weeks about the enlargement of the European Union. That enlargement extends our borders to Russia, to Ukraine and Belarus – it is hardly surprising if issues of border control and immigration policy are centre stage. But when it comes to immigration, no country is an island. A real debate is needed at European level, and not the kind of distasteful sloganeering that we suffered at the Seville European Council. As a policy issue, immigration is simple. Unless we open our markets to goods from poorer countries, thus helping their people to prosper, we will take their people. And unless we set our own immigration policy, either anarchy will reign or – more worryingly – criminal gangs of human traffickers will set that policy for us. What a pity that our governments did not listen a little more carefully to the advice of the Canadian Government about how, if we wished to get on top of the trafficking in people, we should open our front door a little to legal migration, in order to close our back door more effectively against illegal migration. I congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the proposals that he brought forward a couple of years ago at the beginning of this whole debate. I deeply regret that Member States did not adopt them as proposed. The debate has been dominated by the repressive aspects of migration policy and has shown scant regard for its humanitarian aspects. The strategy has hardly been one of small steps as the Commissioners suggested – one of ‘faltering feet’ is perhaps a better description. I had the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in this House for the first two years of that discussion. I regret not only the EU’s failure to establish effective and complete policies on immigration and asylum, but also its failure to ensure responsible stewardship of our economy which is intimately linked with immigration. The Commission’s review of the European economy in 2002 shows the devastating economic consequences of stagnating population growth, which could lead to the rate of potential economic growth falling by 1% of GDP per annum for the next 50 years. What should we do? Well, exhortations to procreation have never been known to work. The evidence suggests that the higher our living standards become, the less people will want to have children. So for economic reasons too, we need a mature debate about a policy of managed migration. I hope that this afternoon’s debate will contribute to achieving some joined-up thinking on immigration policy. I have been asked to report on the readmission agreement with Hong Kong. I regret that Parliament has been neither consulted nor kept informed during the negotiations on this readmission agreement, that we find ourselves in the position of having to deliver our opinion after the agreement has been initialled – and, moreover, after the Agriculture Council on 23 December adopted the decision authorising its signing. According to Rule 97 of our Rules of Procedure, throughout the negotiations – and here I quote: ‘The Commission and the Council shall inform the committee responsible regularly and thoroughly of the progress of the negotiations’. I deplore the fact that did not happen, all the more so because this is the first readmission agreement negotiated by the Community. In the case of future agreements, I ask that Parliament be kept informed about the state of negotiations by the Commission and the Council. Readmission is about the return of persons found irregularly on our territory. Few in this House would deny the need for a policy of return. It is an integral part of any credible immigration policy. Effective return safeguards the integrity of asylum policies and of regular immigration programmes and it acts as a deterrent to irregular migration. Return has risen to prominence essentially because of the way in which our over-stretched asylum systems are being used as alternatives to a closed-door immigration policy. When the Council adopted its return action programme at the end of last month, I am sure it took into account the many advantages of assisted voluntary return, as well as the possibility of forced return. The advantage of assisted voluntary return is that it permits return in a non-punitive and a cost-effective way. It has been shown to work in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in the Netherlands and in Belgium. It is more convenient and it is less costly, both financially and politically, than deportation. It has been almost exclusively a European phenomenon and we need more research on the sustainability of return under AVR programmes. But our policy needs to be rational, driven not by prejudice, but by a sober assessment of our needs. It must be carried out by governments who ought to resist the temptation sometimes to deport in order to seek approval from the mob. That policy must also address gender and health issues which are vital in this debate. The readmission agreement on which I have been asked to report is the first readmission agreement that the Community is entering into. I share the Commissioner’s appreciation of the willingness of the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate this with us. There is a danger that today’s debate will be confused with a debate on Hong Kong tomorrow which reflects concern about the implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. Some may argue that Hong Kong is not a safe country. I accept the assurance given on 10 December by Donald Tsang, Hong Kong’s Chief Secretary, when he gave his personal guarantee about the free flow of information and the freedom of speech remaining essential characteristics of Hong Kong society. Nor have I any doubt that the Hong Kong administration is competent to administer a readmission agreement. Moreover the agreement itself refers to international commitments to the protection of vulnerable persons. However, what concerns me about this agreement is that it is the first in what will be a series of such agreements. Authorisation has already been given for the negotiation of such agreements with many countries – some of them have even been initialled. The fact is that some of those agreements will be far harder than this one. Therefore, I would ask the Commission this afternoon to clarify a number of issues. The first concerns the scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by the Member States, the categories of people involved and their countries of origin. Are the measures that Member States have adopted adequate and effective? Since this House is also very concerned to ensure that the policies of return and the readmission agreements we negotiate respect fundamental rights, I would also ask how the Commission proposes to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected in the event of repatriation, especially if this occurs on a large scale. Is the Commission sure that the readmission agreements it is proposing are compatible with our obligations under international refugee law? Will the Commission commit itself to establishing joint monitoring mechanisms with the countries with which we make readmission agreements? The House would like answers to all these questions. I would also like to know why the European Parliament is never mentioned in the Commission’s communication on a Community return policy. I would like clarification as to which coherent and transparent financial instrument will be used for the return policy in question and readmission agreements in particular. The role of the European Parliament as one arm of the budgetary authority is clearly important in this, and I would be interested to know whether we will, from a financial point of view, need a new legal base for this policy. The human rights clause in the readmission agreement used for Hong Kong is not strong enough to protect us against all eventualities in such agreements with other countries. We should recognise that, while concluding the agreement with Hong Kong was a relatively easy matter, as we were able to offer them visa-free access to the EU in return, cutting a deal with countries such as Russia and Morocco will be not a whit as easy. We will need to provide incentives for many third countries to cooperate with us, rather than threatening them with economic sanctions, as Mr Blair and Mr Aznar proposed in Seville. That is why I welcome the Commission’s recent communication on integrating migration issues into the Union’s external relations policy. If we join up the dots between this paper, our development policy, the negotiations on readmission and our economic need for immigration, we will be demonstrating the joined-up thinking we so urgently require in immigration and asylum policy.
Watson (ELDR

 –
 Mr President, I do not wish to reopen a debate which this Parliament has already had but you were elected on a programme for reform of this House. Powerful elements in the two major groups have blocked that reform and I hope, Mr President, that the Council and the Commission, represented here today, will see the strength of feeling in this House in favour of such reform, greater than it has ever been, and will take that into account.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, the reason this motion and this debate are on our agenda is due to the insistence of the Christian Democrats and Conservatives in the PPE-DE, and the Socialists and Social Democrats in the PSE. There is no need for us to have this debate today. My group is in favour of equal conditions for all Members in a Members' Statute but this motion makes it harder and more difficult for us to achieve such a statute. If the motion proposed by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering is adopted, it will block progress in our discussions with the Council. Those two gentlemen gave you a mandate for exploratory discussions with Council and yet their parties now want to force a vote on Mr Rothley's opinion before giving Parliament the chance to consider the outcome of your discussions. Mr Rothley's opinion wants to include in the Members' Statute issues of primary law such as immunities and privileges which require ratification by national parliaments. The message about reform that they are sending to the Council is ‘take it or leave it’. The message that they are sending to MEPs who want reform is ‘forget it’. My party's joint resolution with the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups calls for a common statute, agreed with national governments in the Council, giving equality of treatment to MEPs and transparency in our allowances. Our question to individual members of the PPE-DE and the PSE, many of whom will be laughing all the way to the bank if they stop reform, is this: have you no self-respect? Have you no concern for the reputation of this House? I am accused in Mr Rothley's press release of being unserious, of making dishonest accusations. Mr Rothley, I take seriously the accusations of dishonesty made by citizens against us. Mr Barón Crespo accuses me of heaping invective on the socialists. If I am heaping invective on you, Mr Barón Crespo, why are so many of your members, including all of your British members, going to support our motion in the vote tomorrow? The answer is that you heap invective on yourselves and you deserve it. Moreover, you heap invective on those of us who recognise the public concern, who admit that the expenses regime is unjustifiable and who seek to introduce the highest standards into the management of this House. Mr President, we abuse the taxpayer at our peril and we demean democratic politics through not reforming. In calling on Members to support the resolution put forward by three groups, I call on them to reject the description of politicians put forward in the words of the poet, Hilaire Belloc, when he wrote: ‘With pomp and ridiculous display, The Politician's corpse was borne away, While those around him carped and slanged, I wept: I would have seen him hanged.’ (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to ask whether you can confirm whether the reindeer were on the ground or in the air at the time. (Laughter)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, in 1997 the process by which fixed and mobile telephony and television and the Internet were increasingly coming together was known by the buzz word 'convergence'. The Commission adopted a much heralded Green Paper on this subject which promised a brave new world of horizontal regulation across platforms. The reality was much more prosaic. Convergence did not happen quite to the extent predicted and the Commission confined itself largely to revising the telecommunications regulation package to take account of new technology. Since that time, however, we have witnessed a wave of mergers and take-overs in the media with the emergence of vast conglomerates such as AOL Time Warner, CBS, Viacom and Vivendi Universal. Yet the Commission has not explored the idea of cross-media ownership and media concentration in any detail since its 1994 follow-up to the Green Paper on pluralism and media concentration. The Commission's silence on such an important issue seems particularly strange because the European Parliament has been calling for a directive on a level playing field and media pluralism since the 1990s. I recognise that regulating the media is a highly sensitive issue. The media is not like any other industry as it lies at the heart of our culture, our way of life. A diverse and pluralistic media is fundamental to democracy, freedom and cultural diversity. But in view of the trend towards media concentration, towards the dominance of certain media conglomerates, my group believes it is high time that we come back to this issue. What are the principles which should underlie our approach? First of all we must recognise that a thriving media is the hallmark of a free society. If control of the media becomes too narrowly restricted in the hands of a small number of people this poses a danger for democracy. The media needs to be sufficiently diverse for all important points of view in society to be effectively presented. Otherwise there is a danger that dominant media players can restrict access to information and thereby move public opinion. Avoiding media concentration is also important to our economy. Some have argued that with the explosion of different types of media, including digital, satellite and cable television, as well as the Internet, monopolistic control is impossible. However, many of these different channels of communication are now controlled by the same media conglomerates, which can thereby cross-promote these services and provide incentives or pressure advertisers to buy space or air time in other media they control. Last but not least, media concentration has implications for our cultural diversity. A Europe in which the media is dominated by a few major players risks being one in which certain regions, cultures and minority groups are granted less access to the media. A diverse media is likely to result in more home-grown original content, whereas large media groups may not resist the temptation to fill their air time with cheap imported programmes and repeats. For the ELDR Group there is a clear case to look again at this issue. My questions to the Commission today are: what action does the Commission propose to take? If the Commissioner takes the view, as I suspect he may, that there is no legal basis for action, I would remind him of the articles of the Treaty governing the single market. I would remind him too that Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees media pluralism and if that Charter is integrated into a new constitutional treaty, as Liberal Democrats hope it will be, would that not provide a necessary legal base for action? Will the Commission undertake to bring forward a White Paper updating its 1994 communication in the light of technological change and developments in the industry? It seems to me that we cannot ignore the dangers that media concentration poses to our society. The power of media ownership now frequently extends across national borders. Given that a free and diverse media is essential to our continent's democracy, prosperity and cultural vitality, it is high time that politicians face up to their responsibilities and return to this issue.

 – Mr President, if the Treaty had been rejected by your countrymen, this week's Council would have been marred by recrimination and disarray. Due in no small part to your efforts, Ireland's 'yes' vote has put us back on track for Europe to be reunited in 2004. The decisions that remain will not be easy. As our esteemed former colleague the President-in-Office has said, decisions involving money rarely are. But the Heads of State and Government must not allow themselves to flunk this historic opportunity by fighting over how to pay the bill. My group believes that enlargement can be financed under the financial arrangements agreed in Berlin. Some shifting between the different headings should be possible, within the overall limits. The final package must guarantee that new Member States will not be net contributors before 2007. Otherwise we will feed resentment and face the risk of more cliff-hanger referenda in the aspirant countries. Inevitably, the major area of disagreement is the common agricultural policy. While the Liberal Group does not regards CAP reform as a precondition for enlargement, it is clear that significant reform of our farm policies is essential to the success of enlargement and also for other reasons. I hear that President Chirac expects the United Kingdom to bring its budget rebate into play, while he refuses to countenance reform of his farm policies before 2006. We support the Commission's proposals to phase in income support to farmers for the new Member States, but we also expect all existing Member States to commit themselves to far-reaching reform of the CAP, as proposed in the mid-term review. The second major area of concern is the readiness of the applicant states to live within the disciplines of the single market and respect the European Union's values. We share the concern expressed in the Commission's progress report about corruption in a number of these countries and the need for progress in implementing EU legislation, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs. That is why it is right that there should be a reinforced monitoring system to ensure that countries fulfil their commitments. The President of the Commission called for enthusiasm and intelligence. Commissioner Verheugen's approach has demonstrated the latter, but a touch more enthusiasm in the Council for enlargement and for the new Europe it heralds would not go amiss. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 – Mr President, Commission President Mr Prodi described the Stability and Growth Pact last week as 'stupid, like all decisions which are rigid'. Commissioner Lamy is also on record as having described the pact as 'medieval'. Aside from the questionable wisdom of using such strong language, especially to a newspaper from the country which is doing the most damage to what remains of the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, one begins to wonder whether this is part of an orchestrated campaign. My question to the Commission President is this: in making your remarks to Le Monde
 – and you have said that you stand by every word – was it your intention to launch a debate on how to reform the Stability and Growth Pact? If so, that is a debate we welcome, but surely a debate which would better have been conducted some months ago. Had the Commission acted more firmly then, using the licence that we gave you when we invested you, its own authority and that of the Stability and Growth Pact might have suffered less damage. In the current circumstances, no change is clearly not an option, but two principles must guide us. The first is that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle. The second is that the rules are the same for all countries, large or small. Those principles are at the heart of the Stability and Growth Pact and my group expects them to be the starting point for any reform. If today marks the beginning of a debate on how to improve and strengthen the Pact, what reforms do we need to give it renewed credibility? First of all let us be clear on what we should not do. We should not call into question the 3% limit for deficits as we hit hard economic times. If countries do not pay off their debts, then we will all pay the price in higher interest rates and a weaker currency. The Liberal Group agrees with Mr Prodi that the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied intelligently. That is why we supported the Commission's decision to allow two more years for countries to return their budgets to balance, because growth had been slower than expected. But we must not forget that postponement to 2006 came with strings attached in the form of a requirement to reduce structural deficits by 0.5% year on year. The Liberal Group believes that a new target for the structural deficit should be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. That would increase pressure on governments to reduce their deficits in their good times so that they can allow borrowing to take the strain when times are bad. On that analysis, any intelligent interpretation would clearly conclude that France's recent budget makes no effort to reduce its structural deficit and is clearly in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact. France must therefore face an early warning. That is what we would like to hear from the Commission today. When the Commission brings forward a proposal for such an early warning, then it will help to restore credibility to the Pact. The Liberal Group agrees with you, Mr Prodi, that the Stability and Growth Pact needs authority behind it to apply it. That is why we call for the Commission to have the power to issue early warnings against countries which are breaching the rules, whether Finance Ministers agree or not. Only if the Pact has a strong policeman can Member States be forced into taking corrective action while they can afford to. Let us be clear. We will not support any reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact which undermine the basic principles of fiscal responsibility and equality before the law. The end point of reform must be a strengthened Stability and Growth Pact which punishes fiscal largesse
 and rewards countries which run their budgets responsibly. Judging by the warm welcome which Francis Mer, the French finance minister, gave to your remarks in that interview, I fear that France will feel empowered to flout the rules. If you wish to have the authority to enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, then you must earn that authority by acting promptly against France and any other countries which might be tempted to follow their example. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 – Mr President, many of us never thought we would witness in our lifetimes the fall of the Berlin Wall. That event changed the face of Europe and heralded a process of emancipation for our neighbours in central and eastern Europe which is nearing its conclusion. It is worth reminding ourselves of the 13 long years this process has taken as the siren voices of the sceptics seek to dash enlargement on the rocks. In a previous debate, I described enlargement as a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam. I thank Mr Prodi for presenting today the Commission's assessment of the readiness of the applicant states to join the European Union which marks those countries' completion of a major assignment in that process. They are now approaching the final examination at the Copenhagen Summit. The prospects look good although they still have some hard work to do in the months ahead if they are to make the grade. The Liberal Democrat Group has always sought to apply the Copenhagen criteria and the timetable, not to elevate one above the other. We, therefore, welcome the Commission's conclusion that the ten applicant states will be ready to join the European Union by 2004, but that monitoring of their preparations will continue. A reinforced monitoring system is necessary because the overview provided by the Commission clearly shows that there are deficiencies in the readiness of those applicant countries and we should be open about this. If we are to convince our own people of the case for enlargement, it must be clear that we are not sweeping problems under the carpet. Openness about those problems and the measures taken to tackle them will make us better able to reassure the doubters. I therefore call on the Commission to transmit to Parliament all the regular enlargement reports which it will make to Council. If we await the comprehensive monitoring report six months before enlargement, the Commission may have no alternative but to impose safeguards since the nuclear option of suspending enlargement may not be viable. I hope that the threat of those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that they are not used. Neither should we forget, however, that it is not only our own voters who have to be convinced. There are referenda to be won in the applicant states. Critics in those countries who compare the European Union to the old Soviet Union are confusing a jacket with a straightjacket. Yet we must show those countries that they will benefit from enlargement from year one. This means a generous financial settlement which precludes them becoming net contributors in the short term. By introducing a secession clause in a new constitutional treaty, we would also assuage any fears that to join the European Union is to throw away the keys to freedom. My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the acquis
 in justice and home affairs. We must be firm on the failings of the candidate countries, yet we must recognise that the report before us today is only a progress report. My own country struggled to meet the criteria 15 months before accession. Thirty years later, some might say that it is still struggling. One thing is clear, however. The monitoring of compliance with EU laws and respect for the Union's values is not a process which should end upon accession. The Liberal Group welcomes the date of 2007 along with a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania. The steps which they need to take must be clearly outlined by the Commission in time for Copenhagen, so that they are clear on what needs to be done. The recent reforms undertaken by the Turkish Government represent a real breakthrough and, while no date can be set for Turkey's accession until the political criteria are met, we will watch with interest the implementation of these reforms. Turkey must be offered a pre-accession strategy accompanied by more financial support and a friendlier political environment. We must show the world that we are not an elite Christian club. The question of Cyprus will also have to be resolved to smooth the way for Turkey's entry. Here we look to Greece and Turkey to help broker an agreement before the Copenhagen Summit. The prospect of the whole of Cyprus joining the EU would start the Greek Presidency on a positive note which we hope would conclude, in Thessaloniki, with a summit symbolising reconciliation. In conclusion, the enlargement marathon is nearing the finish line. Despite the exertions thus far, the participants must be prepared for a sprint finish. Once they cross the line in Copenhagen, they will have little time to celebrate, the training for the next marathon begins – the marathon of meeting the acquis communautaire
 and achieving democratic endorsement of the enlargement process. (Applause)

 – Madam President, the establishment of the ICC marks a huge step forward in enforcing, at a global level, the principle of the rule of law which is fundamental to all liberal democracies. While ad hoc tribunals, such as those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, are doing invaluable work, there is no substitute for a permanent court with the mandate and legitimacy to prosecute criminals wherever they may hide. We need only look at Croatia's refusal to hand over General Bobetko to The Hague on the grounds that Croatia was not the aggressor, to see the problems which can arise. In negotiations on the Rome Statute, Europe bent over backwards to achieve an outcome which would accommodate American concerns. It is therefore a matter of deep regret to Liberal Democrats in this House that a number of countries have refused to sign the Rome Statute for the ICC. These countries include Iran, Iraq, North Korea and the United States. If we follow the old adage 'you will be judged by the company you keep', what message does the USA's presence in this group of refusniks send to the world? Especially when taken in conjunction with America's disavowal of the Kyoto protocol, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Biological Weapons Convention. It is bad enough that the USA is refusing to ratify the Rome Statute, but to try to strangle it at birth by reaching bilateral agreements with countries such as Israel and Romania in order to prevent its nationals being surrendered to the ICC is terrible. UN Security Council Resolution 1422 also sets a dangerous precedent and should not be renewed next July. The European Union should do its utmost to avoid undermining the ICC before it has even begun its work. I therefore urge the President-in-Office of the Council to recognise the storm-clouds gathering over this issue and to pull the EU Member States together under one umbrella. In an age of instability it is understandable that the EU wishes to avoid a breakdown in transatlantic relations, but any agreement with the USA must be supported by all EU countries and be consistent with the Rome Statute. Another failure on our part to show unity would further undermine the EU's credibility in foreign affairs. We must get our own house in order. The countries wishing to join us, including the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Malta, must understand that the values the ICC represents are fundamental to the European Union, and that speedy ratification of the Rome Statute would prevent any delay in their accession. We urge Romania not to ratify its bilateral agreement with the USA, and it is also important for the Union to act together within the ICC in terms of financial support and the appointment of judges, the prosecutor and staff. By acting together, Europe can contribute greatly to making the ICC work, and thereby reassure the USA that the Court is serious and poses no threat to their law-abiding nationals. We must work to bring the Americans on board at a later date. Neither government must forget that we are accountable to the court of world public opinion. In conclusion, Madam President, the ICC is a symbol of the world for which we strive – a world in which human rights and international law will be upheld everywhere, and most of all, a world in which no shelter will be given to those guilty of the vilest crimes. Let us work together to enable the court to get off to a flying start when it becomes operational in January. Madam President, I too apologise to the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, but I must leave the debates, since I must chair a meeting of my party. (Applause)

 – Mr President, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein poses a real threat. He has used weapons of mass destruction in the past to oppress his own people and in seeking to draw Israel into a wider Middle East war. The international community has a responsibility to stop Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction. Yet the consequences of war are potentially so serious that, for my group, it should be only a last resort. Avoiding war does not mean letting Saddam Hussein off the hook. Those who urge America not to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iraq are not appeasers, as Donald Rumsfeld implies when he compares George W. Bush to Winston Churchill. To my mind that comparison is more absurd than Dan Quayle comparing himself to John F. Kennedy. If I may paraphrase Senator Lloyd Benson I would say 'Donald, George W. Bush ain't no Winston Churchill'! The real lesson of history is this: Churchill correctly identified the Nazi threat at an early stage but when he acted it was not unilaterally and pre-emptively. He drew a line in the sand. He acted with moral authority and international backing when that line was crossed. Churchill did not bomb Berlin and try to overthrow the Nazi regime based on his suspicions of Hitler; he acted in concert with his allies when it was clear that he had right on his side. For the ELDR Group the issue today is about getting United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, not about George W. Bush settling an old family score with Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi Government must comply with UN resolutions and must let weapons inspectors back in unconditionally. Once in, those inspectors must be allowed to go wherever they want, whenever they want. Only if Iraq refuses to readmit inspectors, if it unreasonably obstructs their work or if those inspectors find evidence of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction would the international community be justified in taking further action. European governments must make clear their support for UN-backed military action in those circumstances. If it comes to war it must be the international community that acts together, not the United States unilaterally. A UN resolution needs to be approved setting a deadline for Iraqi compliance. A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations. Frankly, as the Commissioner said, our task would be a lot easier if the US showed the same focus on resolving the crisis in the Middle East, as it does on removing Saddam Hussein. We also need to think seriously about how to rebuild stability in the region after any strike. The international coalition, including America, must commit resources to nation-building. Unless we rebuild its economy and society and help to develop viable political institutions, an Iraq devastated by war would risk imploding and posing an even greater danger to the stability of the region. We cannot postpone the debate much longer by claiming that no decisions are imminent. I would say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: Mr Haarder, it is no good saying the European Union's position is clear while referring to a statement of 20 May. The Union's position is as clear as mud. If it were clear, Ambassador Burghardt in Washington would not lament how Member States are jealously guarding their own access to the American Administration rather than acting as a common front. Just as at the UN Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union will have influence only if it acts as a United States of Europe. That is your job. Consensus needs to be built about how to tackle the threat, evidence of weapons of mass destruction needs to be published and – most importantly of all – any strike needs to be backed by international law and the moral authority of the international community. The world cannot afford the instability which would come from a unilateral and pre-emptive military adventure in Iraq. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I know that the President-in-Office, a highly respected former colleague in this House, will take back our views to the General Affairs Council. There may be no consensus among the Member States, but there is broad consensus in this House. Since the end of the Gulf War, our strategy has been one of containment and deterrence. To change that strategy, we need compelling evidence that our objectives in the regions would be better served by military strikes. Even with such evidence, military action should not be undertaken without clear and realistic political objectives and a commitment to finance and administer the necessary reconstruction. To win a war against terrorism in one country, you need broad consensus of support in that country. To win a war against terror across borders, we need to build a consensus across borders. The Council must unite, either to agree such objectives, to make such a commitment, to build such a consensus, or to rein in the declared ambitions of the United States. Mr President-in-Office, an opinion poll by the German Marshall Fund and the Council on Foreign Relations shows that two European citizens in three support the Union acting in this way. We in this debate are urging you to seize the initiative.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit raises a very important point because this is an issue on which decisions may well be made before our September II part-session. We know that Member States are under great pressure at present and the matter needs to be dealt with. At the same time, it was the view of the Conference of Presidents last week – and I believe it would be the view of this House – that we need to have a full debate on the current situation regarding a possible armed attack on Iraq. I would ask you, Mr President, either to take up Mr Barón Crespo's suggestion or to try to find a way of scheduling such a debate on the International Criminal Court this week without eating into the time foreseen for the debate on Iraq.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – President-in-Office, you take on the presidency of the European Council at a time when the Union faces its greatest-ever challenge: the largest expansion of our Community in the history of European integration. If you succeed – as we are confident you will – your presidency will tear down the last vestiges of the Iron Curtain. As you rightly point out in your programme, Europe will have come full circle, from the Copenhagen Summit of 1993, which set the accession criteria, to the Copenhagen Summit which reunites Europe in 2002. Why are Liberals in this House confident that you will succeed? Not only because you have prepared so thoroughly for this task but also because you assume the presidency of the Council at a time when Liberals also occupy the presidencies of the European Commission and the European Parliament. With governments of left and right bowing to narrow national interests and placing in jeopardy this historic reunification, history appeals to the generosity of the liberal spirit. We appeal to Blair and Schröder on the left and to Aznar, Berlusconi and Chirac on the right to pause for a moment and ponder: what picture will Europe project to the world if you squabble like Roman soldiers under the cross over a fraction of 1% of GDP? (Applause)
 It is not easy to be a Liberal when greed and prejudice fill the air, but rest assured, President-in-Office, that Liberal Democrats in this House will maintain our unfailing support for enlargement under the criteria laid down in Copenhagen. I regret that the Spanish presidency was not able to lighten your workload by making greater progress on agriculture and fisheries, which have been spoken of today. While we strongly support reform of the CAP and the CFP, this must not be a precondition for enlargement. Let nobody assume that in our eagerness to secure the prize of enlargement, we will allow reform to fall by the wayside. But neither will we be held to ransom by the practice which allows the European Union's agenda to be dictated by the timetable of national elections. The other hurdle that you must surmount is the paucity of public preparedness. A Eurobarometer poll shows that only one citizen in five feels well informed about EU enlargement. Ireland must approve the Nice Treaty, and beyond Copenhagen, national parliaments and this House must ratify the accession treaties. If popular fears about candidate countries and the costs of enlargement are not addressed, the process could yet be derailed. However, this challenge will be in large measure addressed if Denmark's proud tradition of openness and accountability is put to good use in opening up the Council beyond the timid measures agreed in Seville, and if you give your excellent European Affairs Minister free rein to take on the Eurosceptics. In justice and home affairs the ELDR Group welcomes your detailed programme to protect our people from terrorism. We hope that as good Liberals you will demonstrate the same zeal in taking forward measures to protect citizens' freedoms, as you show in tackling terrorist threats. In the area of immigration and asylum, I appeal to you to use the tried and tested Community method to make progress and to overcome the short-sighted opposition of others to a European border guard corps. In answer to the remarks of my friend, Mr Baron Crespo, I would far rather be an asylum-seeker trying to get into Denmark – where I would have a greater chance of success – than one of the huddled masses trying to get into Mr Blair's bleak Britain. (Applause)
 On sustainable development, your commitment to concentrate on measures to put people back to work and ensure a sound economy rather than add to the proliferation of targets is music to Liberal Democrat ears. We also applaud your aim to match further progress on energy liberalisation with common ground rules on energy taxation, and you can count on our support to broker the necessary deals on the many financial services measures needed by the end of this year if we are to complete the financial services action plan on time by 2004. President-in-Office, with such a magnitude of tasks you shoulder a great burden. Re-uniting Europe is rightly your number one concern. We wish you well and we offer you our support, for it is on our generation this responsibility falls; it is to us this challenge is made and it is with us that hope resides. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, for the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the key test of Seville was the agreement on immigration and asylum which elevated discussion beyond the search for cheap newspaper headlines and into the core of the challenge. A casual reader of the newspapers in the run-up to Seville might have believed that the Prime Minister of Spain was playing Don José to Tony Blair's Carmen in a passionate but deadly delusion about using development aid as a weapon in the crackdown on illegal migrants. We, therefore, welcome the success of Prime Minister Verhofstadt and others in redressing the balance of the European Council's draft conclusions. In particular we are pleased that the Council recalled the importance of economic cooperation, free trade, development aid and conflict prevention in tackling the causes of illegal immigration. I applaud the Council's emphasis on providing incentives to developing countries to cooperate in the management of migration flows rather than on suspending development aid for non-cooperation. However, rather than simply setting new targets for achieving progress on immigration and asylum, Heads of State and Government would do better to stop clogging up the decision-making process with national initiatives and to back Commission proposals under the Community method. That means using qualified majority voting to ensure that decisions can be taken. Concerning the proposals for reform of the proceedings of the Council, it is all very well for Heads of State and Government to talk about introducing greater transparency into the workings of the Council. However, this will not be achieved merely by allowing cameras into the room for a ritual round-table debate and for the votes. We need to achieve real transparency by giving access to Council documents on the Internet, from when they are first discussed by officials right up to ministerial level. It is disgraceful that Council officials in the Secretariat are refusing to make Room documents and unnumbered documents publicly available. A rationalisation of the number of Councils is no doubt called for, but it would be far better for this to be done in conjunction – as the President of the Commission said – with similar moves in Parliament and in the Commission so that lines of accountability and responsibility are clear. I am also concerned that the abolition of the Development Council could be seen as a downgrading of the Union's role in development assistance, which must not be allowed to happen. Following the Barcelona Summit, I warned in this Chamber of the danger of a credibility gap opening up if the ambitious targets set for economic reform were not implemented. In particular I called for progress to be made towards an integrated financial services market. I, therefore, warmly congratulate the Spanish Presidency on securing a deal on the pensions directive – which had been blocked in Council since July of last year – as well as agreement on the market abuse directive, because behind the sound and fury over illegal immigration it is steady progress on technical but vital issues such as these which show the worth of a presidency. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for a helpful introduction to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteurs for their good work on the reports before us today. I also take this opportunity to welcome to this House the parliamentarians from the Liberal family in the applicant states who are watching this debate from the gallery and have joined us to debate the issues this week. That parliamentarians from Bulgaria and Romania are here today is a welcome reminder that we are negotiating enlargement with 12 applicant states, even if the timescales for accession may differ a little. Those of us from countries that were not founder members of the European Community remember only too well the anxiety and sense of expectation which surrounded our entry negotiations and the decisions to ratify our application. Coming from a country which had its application vetoed twice, I know of the enduring damage done to perceptions of European integration when a country is rejected. We should bear this in mind in assessing the current applicants. We must recognise that the applicant states have worked hard in recent years to reform their economies and consolidate democracy in order to join the Union. While we expect them to redouble their efforts in the run-up to and after accession, we must also reward those efforts. That is why Liberal Democrats insist that both the criteria and the timetable must be respected. We should not apply stricter standards than for previous enlargements, nor pretend that everything in our own gardens smells sweet. Enlargement is a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam. There are hotheads and faint hearts on both sides who will seek to exploit difficulties in meeting the Copenhagen criteria. We must not allow them to derail enlargement. It is far better to overcome outstanding problems through the enlargement process. What is important to the health of a country is the direction in which its face is set and the screening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be an ongoing process, part of a wider scrutiny of all Member States – old and new – in a European Union with the Charter of Fundamental Rights at its heart. Liberal Democrats deplore the abuse of enlargement negotiations to reopen old wounds and animosities. The infamous Beneš decrees are a good example of this. It serves no useful purpose to inflame tensions on this issue, which is why my group has tabled amendments to Mr Brok's report to seek to lower the temperature of the debate. The refusal of four governments – including Mr Murphy's – at the General Affairs Council this week to reach agreement on a common position on agriculture stems in part from the inadequacy of the financing package agreed in Berlin. We are constrained to live within Berlin's limits, but if a deal is postponed until autumn – as some propose – this would jeopardise the prospect of admitting new Member States in time for the European Parliament elections in 2004. We support the Commission's proposals to phase-in direct payments but, as soon as enlargement is agreed, we must take forward reform of the CAP. We need to shift the focus away from the producer onto the consumer, from quantity to quality. On the controversial issue of free movement of persons, I urge all Member States to follow the lead of Denmark, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands, which have said they will apply no restrictions to free movement. There are no rational grounds for believing that enlargement will be followed by the mass migration sometimes feared by our citizens. It is precisely these fears which we, as politicians, have to tackle head on. We have a responsibility to make the case for enlargement to our electorates and we must not shrink from that challenge. The adoption of the report to be voted on tomorrow will give the green light to enlargement. The historic prospect beckons of a wider, stronger Union – a bulwark for freedom and democracy in an uncertain world. Let ours not be the generation which flunks this opportunity. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, the House may be aware that the United States have announced this afternoon the arrest of a suspect for an alleged plot to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb on United States soil. The package of measures which were passed by this House before Christmas and immediately after Christmas on an effective European response to terrorism are still not on the statute book despite the pains that we went to deal with them quickly. On behalf of this House, I therefore ask you to call on the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, who are meeting on Thursday of this week, to make sure that that package goes through as quickly as possible. I believe we owe it to our friends in the United States to ensure that Europe's safeguards against terrorism are as good as possible, since they are clearly still facing a very serious potential threat.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, it is sometimes hard to keep a clear head when grievances fill the air and I think we are seeing the results of that. It is clear that certain allegations have been made about the activity of certain Commissioners and others in a case involving fisheries, but this matter has been considered by the Conference of Presidents. The Fisheries Committee has been asked to look into it and report back to the Conference of Presidents and I understand that the Budgetary Control Committee is also looking into it. It is important that we allow due process to take place in Parliament before raising these issues in plenary. It is also important that we do not mix the question of these allegations with a very important communication that the Commission has brought forward on the future of the common fisheries policy on how to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. So I would ask you, Mr President, to ask Mr Schulz, on behalf of the Socialist Group, to bring this back to the Conference of Presidents in due course.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, since 11 September, we have all said that Europe and the USA must stand shoulder to shoulder because we share common values. We must support our ally in its time of need in the same way as America came to Europe's aid twice in the darkest hours of the last century. Yet, this support need not be uncritical. True friends and allies must talk to each other and, more importantly, listen to each other. Sadly, as the Commissioner has said, there have been too many examples recently of poor communication and the turning of deaf ears in transatlantic relations. As the Commissioner demonstrated admirably to Mr Elles, candour is sometimes an obligation of friendship. We must say candidly that on some issues Europe believes the US has got it wrong. Claims that the International Criminal Court would have untrammelled power to prosecute members of the US military are simply not true. To disown the body will not prevent it from going ahead, the US will simply lose all influence over the way the rules develop. American arguments at the UN summit on children against safeguards – because they would prevent judicial execution of minors in Texas – offend the European concept of justice, just as US treatment of Taliban prisoners in the Shibarghan camp in northern Afghanistan seems to us to violate the Geneva Convention. Staying out of the Kyoto agreement on climate change means that the US is free-riding on the efforts of others to tackle global warming. How can we expect the developing world to make its industries environmentally sustainable when the world's leading economy passes the buck so shamelessly? On steel tariffs also, US policy is misguided. Rather than re-structure its steel industry, the US risks losing the moral high ground in the global campaign for free trade. However, the breakdown in communication across the Atlantic is due not only to errors of judgment on the US side. It does not help that the European Union is at sixes and sevens. Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar looked distinctly uncomfortable with each other at the summit. The failure of Member States to back the Commission in its response to the steel tariffs dispute undermines the credibility of the Union and weakens our negotiating hand. The Union's failure to speak with one voice, from Iraq to India, makes it mighty difficult for the US to know where we stand. For the Union to have a credible foreign policy we need a common security policy. It is no use establishing a 60 000 strong rapid reaction force if we cannot get it up and running in practice or reach agreement on a common arms procurement policy. In other areas too, from policing on the ground to a single European sky, we will not be taken seriously by the Americans until we get our own act together. Finally, the Union could take a leaf out of the US book in its policy towards China over Taiwan. It is disgraceful that Taiwan, a fully-fledged democracy since 1987, is made a pariah by EU governments which claim to represent democratic values. It is high time that Member States stood together behind the EU flag to open normal relations with Taiwan and take a stand at the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva against the PRC's human rights abuses. In conclusion, the European Union would be better placed to engage in a real dialogue of equals with the US, if we displayed more unity and demonstrated more backbone. Liberal Democrats look to the Convention on the future of Europe to deliver a federal European Union with a real common foreign and security policy, so that Europe can use active diplomacy to strive for a new approach to global development and convince our American friends to follow.

 – Mr President, the timeliness of this debate is beyond dispute. The recent rise of anti-immigrant sentiment in France and the Netherlands shows what happens when governments fail to respond to the challenge of immigration. We know that, quite apart from the valuable contribution which immigrants bring to our societies in terms of increased cultural diversity, there are sound economic reasons for a policy of managed immigration, such as meeting labour shortages and funding our creaking pension systems. Indeed, our prosperity will depend on immigration. The question therefore is: what policy should we adopt to make immigration politically acceptable? What we must not do, as too many socialist governments have done, is to bury our heads in the sand and refuse to address the challenge. It is in large part the failure of EU governments to police our borders, to tackle discrimination and xenophobia, and to integrate immigrants harmoniously into our societies that has led to this impasse. No wonder public concern continues to grow. The Liberal Democrat approach would be to open the front door a little, by providing legal avenues for immigration, in order better to close the back door to illegal immigration. This approach has been successfully pioneered by the Canadian Government, and is reflected in the European Commission's proposals for a common immigration policy. It is one we would do well to consider. A policy of managed legal immigration, co-ordinated among Member States, does not mean a free-for-all. Incentives to immigrants to settle more evenly across their host countries would help. A policy which balances rights and duties, so that those newly arriving understand that they can work in their host country and enjoy free movement in the Union and other benefits of EU citizenship, would be helpful too. But they must also understand the need to make an effort to integrate and to live by the rules of the society they join. It is nonsensical political correctness to dismiss any requirement that immigrants should learn the language of their host country. Moreover, proper support for integration must be provided and we must combat discrimination and racism wherever it is found. In this regard, I would pay tribute to the work of the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and I commend to political parties the Charter of Political Parties for a non-racist society. We also need to invest more in our justice systems and the enforcement of legal judgments – we can only expect immigrants to respect core values if we too ensure that these values are respected fully by existing society. A policy of managed immigration requires tough action to control the Union's external borders and I therefore congratulate the Commission for its initiative on a common border guard corps. We also need to do more to help the poor and dispossessed, as the Commissioner said, in their countries of origin, so that they do not have to resort in desperation to criminal gangs of people-smugglers. Most people do not want to up sticks and move elsewhere, so helping to relieve the pressure of illegal immigration is yet another argument, if one were needed, for promoting global free trade and making progress towards the UN target of 0.7% of GDP for development aid. As far as asylum policy is concerned, here again the Liberal Democrat Group is broadly supportive of the Commission's proposals and often sceptical of actions proposed in Council. In conclusion, we believe that there is both a moral and an economic case for managed immigration and a humanitarian approach to asylum. We in the ELDR Group will support the Commission in its efforts to move the Union towards the common policies foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty. For in the words of that great Liberal J.K. Galbraith: "Migration is the oldest action against poverty. What is the perversity in the human soul that causes people to resist so obvious a good?". (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 – Mr President, this week we are debating military conflicts in two places: Chechnya and Palestine. Both have worsened since the Western World declared war on terrorism. It seems almost as if the dominant power in each conflict has taken advantage of the anti-terrorist cause to enhance its strategic position. The impact on the lives of those caught in the crossfire, both literally and metaphorically, has been devastating. For reasons of history, humanity and security, we have a duty to intervene to prevent the fighting. Diplomacy, thus far, has failed, whether sponsored by the United Nations, the United States of America, the European Union or the neighbouring states. It is probably the Saudi peace plan which currently offers the most promising pointers to peace. The warring parties themselves offer little hope of a solution. Neither Mr Sharon nor Mr Arafat can secure peace, just as certainly as neither can impose it. Mr Arafat's record of involvement in terrorism and his continued acquiescence in abominable Palestinian terrorist acts are at least in part to blame for the current situation. The best way forward, in the view of Liberal Democrats in this House, is to establish an immediate embargo on arms exports to Israel and Palestine, and to persuade the United Nations to mount an international mission to send troops to the region to enforce peace. (Applause)
 Only then might the extremists be moved aside and the moderates be brought together by an honest broker in a political process in which the arguments of force give way to the force of arguments. Reckless military adventurism on one side and cynical acceptance of terrorism on the other offer only further bloodshed and misery and the deepening of mutual hatreds, which will delay and render more difficult the achievement of lasting peace. The recent Israeli military incursions into Palestinian territory have been as shocking as they have been self-defeating. The West does have levers of pressure. You, Mr Solana, must employ them. An urgent meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council should be called. On the agenda you should have Israel's refusal to allow our representatives to meet Mr Arafat; you should have its wanton destruction of EU-funded infrastructure and its violation of human rights provisions in Article No 2 of the Association Agreement. You might talk to Colin Powell tomorrow about threatening suspension of USD 3 billion of aid annually to Israel. Human rights observers should be deployed to document the plight of innocent Palestinian citizens, who suffer daily disrupted lives, random harassment, gratuitous humiliation and, in some cases, torture and death. The international community is clear on where the borders must be drawn to secure the co-existence in two states of six million Israeli and some 4 million Palestinian citizens. We cannot stand by while United Nations resolutions are flouted by an aggressive policy of settlements and a refusal to seek peace. When international law is so blatantly ignored, such bloodshed, as we have seen, is unavoidable. Those responsible must, eventually, be brought to justice. On Thursday of this week, the statute for a permanent International Criminal Court will enter into force. From Sabra and Chatila 20 years ago, to what is happening in Jenin this afternoon, Mr Sharon might reflect on whether he wishes to be among its first clients. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 – Mr President, we should not lightly move Question Time to the Commission. It is all very well to play high politics in this House but to many of our Members Question Time to the Commission is extremely important. Indeed, much of our work of scrutinising of the Commission is done through Question Time. I accept the case on this occasion, since we wish to have representatives of the Council and the Commission present for the debate. However, I would appeal to my colleagues in the other groups that we do not make a habit of moving Question Time to the Commission. It is an important part of our work. Our view on the question of the vote is that we are in a very fast-moving situation. We will certainly know more by Thursday than we will by Wednesday. There is a good case on this occasion for taking that vote on Thursday lunchtime and not on Wednesday.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments of the previous speakers on the subject of Mr Marco Biagi. President, I congratulate you on the success of your first summit as President of this House. You set out to establish this Parliament as a credible and reliable partner in the interinstitutional dialogue and to demonstrate that Parliament, for its part, has closed what Mr Prodi described as the "delivery gap". You succeeded admirably on both counts. President-in-Office, Liberal Democrats welcome a number of solid achievements at Barcelona. The increase in overseas development aid to an EU average of 0.39% of gross national income is a positive step. If the Union can go on to meet the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income, we will no longer deprive the poor of EUR 100 billion per annum in development assistance. We also applaud the Summit's emphasis on making work pay and on reducing the tax burden on the low-paid, and the agreement on the energy tax directive. We need more economic growth but it must not be at the expense of our natural environment which we hold in trust for future generations. On the Middle East, we welcome the declaration made by the European Council. We urge the Israelis and the Palestinians to start fresh talks based on United Nations Security Council Regulation 1397, to accept international observers, to respect the Geneva Convention and to renounce terrorism and indiscriminate violence. I would also like to congratulate the High Representative, Mr Solana, on the deal he brokered between Serbia and Montenegro: truly a first for European Union diplomacy. British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Barcelona Summit as a "make-or-break" occasion. He may now regret that hyperbole, because although Barcelona undoubtedly represents a step forward on the road to economic reform, it is clear that this road will be long and winding. We must ensure that the delivery gap identified by Mr Prodi does not turn into a credibility gap due to the Council's failure to meet the multitude of targets that it sets at every Summit. One such example of a credibility gap is the partial agreement on energy liberalisation. What credibility will it have in the eyes of the our citizens if we deny them the benefits of more choice and lower energy prices? We urge the Council to support Parliament's call for a second stage of energy liberalisation to include domestic customers by 2005. The EU's credibility is also at stake in financial services. The pension funds directive has remained blocked in Council since it was adopted by Parliament at our first reading in July of last year. This is a prime example of a delivery gap which Parliament has closed but which requires more than warm words from the Council. The Council has other ambitious aspirations too, such as reaching agreement on the European Patent by May, and the Public Procurement Framework. If the credibility of these spring economic summits is not to be undermined, then Prime Ministers must apply themselves to banging heads together to make sure their national ministers make progress on these issues. If we are to close the gap, President-in-Office, between the European Union and its citizens, this will not be achieved by suspending people's rights to free movement, especially if those people wish to exercise their democratic rights to express their views in protest. Moreover, bringing the EU closer to its citizens requires progress on transparency. Paragraph 51 of the conclusions calls for ensuring greater transparency of the legislative process. However, it foresees no specific measures before June and moreover, the Secretary-General's report to Council limits the documents to be covered by transparency to those laws adopted by co-decision. This contravenes the regulation we adopted on access to documents last year which sees a much wider definition of legislative documents. You are already four months late in implementing this. We call on you to do so. Finally, in paragraph 20, the Council conclusions envisage the creation of a group of wise men. I wonder whether, at a time when you recognise the importance of women's participation in the labour force and when you express concern for the welfare of women in Nigeria, you might not, at least in this third millennium, talk about of a group of wise persons.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, the Commissioner has very helpfully outlined the major challenges that enlargement will bring – challenges such as the problems of Kaliningrad, of the Beneš Decrees, of Cyprus; and he has talked a lot about the cost of enlargement. I am, however, very pleased that the President-in-Office drew attention to the cost of non-enlargement, which is by far the greater. It may well be true, as the President-in-Office said, that for us these countries will have waited a "mere" 15 years to join the Union. To them, however, those 15 years will seem more than half as long again as the decade that Spain waited to come into our Union. I believe it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to speed up the process of enlargement. The first step in that process is in the hands of the Presidency this week as the Council meets in Barcelona. President, you have emphasised that we have a responsibility for reuniting our divided continent. We must welcome those who wish to join us as soon as they are ready. But it is not primarily a budgetary question: there are tremendous economic benefits to be gained, and that is where Barcelona comes in; for we need to have the courage to undertake ourselves the difficult economic reforms which we rightly expect of the applicant states. This means, in Barcelona, agreeing important economic reforms, finding the way towards reform of the common agricultural policy, and moving towards reforms of our institutions. The Heads of State and Government must not fudge the opportunity of real economic reform in Barcelona. We must open up the markets for gas and electricity, both wholesale and domestic, by 2005 at the latest. We must recommit ourselves to the package of legislative measures in the financial services action plan, unblocking discussions in the Council. We must also see progress on public procurement and a European patent. If we are to fulfil our objective of staying within the financial perspectives, enlargement must also mean reform of the common agricultural policy. The over-production and waste which characterise the CAP and the worrying consequences for public health of intensive farming methods must be dealt with as we move towards a modern rural development policy, breaking the link with production and creating an environmentally sustainable policy providing aid to our farmers. The prospect of enlargement also requires us to make a success of the Convention. Our institutions and our decision-making procedures are like a Trabant, when what we need is a Mercedes. We need to design a constitutional settlement for the Union of the 21st century which goes beyond Nice, which is based on common rights and values, which addresses the legitimate concerns of our citizens, combining accountability, democracy and efficiency. Here, above all, what is called for is a responsible approach from our Member States. It is not helpful for financial discipline if the Italian Finance Minister questions the finances of enlargement. It is damaging, when a Community of 25 or 27 will need a strong Executive in the Commission, if the Head of Government of one of our large Member States accuses the Commission of a bias against his country, of wanting to smash the culture of one of his industrial producers, and of singling out his country. If we are to insist on a responsible approach from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, then we need a more responsible approach ourselves. I hope that as we move towards the Danish Presidency later this year and the historic decisions on enlargement, we will see a responsible, united and purposeful Western Europe welcoming these new democracies into the democratic fold. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR

 – Six months on from the tragic events of 11 September, now must be the time to reassert the need for effective global governance. While I welcome the Commissioner's statement, I regret the fact that the Commission's work has not been more balanced – recognising, for example, that there is a dark side to globalisation, too – and has not been more ambitious. Why did the Commission not take up Mr Verhofstadt's suggestion that we should have a G8 not based on wealth and composed of the richest nations, but based on population and composed of the world's major regional bodies, thereby involving the African Union, Mercosur, the South Asian Area of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and so on? Globalism has led to a world of interconnected communities. Technology and language learning have transformed our ability to communicate. Trade and investment have changed our economic perspectives and vastly increased our wealth. Travel has opened up new horizons and new opportunities for human contact. And yet all this has not come without a cost, because criminals have organised themselves into global networks; humankind's damage to our natural environment threatens the future viability of life on our planet; and powerlessness and alienation are restricting opportunities for far too many to develop their own abilities and to improve the lot of themselves and their families. History, Mr President, suggests that if the world were truly a global village, many more would be shocked by the misery of the poor. Of 6 billion human beings, half are living on less than EUR 2 per day and 800 million are going to sleep hungry every night. I say, therefore, to our friends on the Right that yes, the market economy, if intelligently regulated, is the most powerful instrument known to mankind to lift people out of poverty. That we have not yet learned to use it properly, however, is shown by financial crises, by environmental degradation and by the continued spread of preventable disease. Moreover, our failure to reach 0.7% of GDP in development aid is depriving the poor of EUR 100 billion per annum. I say to the Left that we need to reform our trade policies because aid and debt relief for developing countries without access to our markets can be nothing more than a palliative. To the Greens I would say that access to scientific progress is also important. It is the key to better nutrition, to improved health and life expectancy and to rising living standards. We must not starve the developing world of the benefits of innovation. The challenge to humankind is to establish effective instruments of international government. The United Nations, the international financial institutions, NATO, etc. have not succeeded as much as they should. Yet, in the European Union we may have a model for wider global governance. We need from our current leaders vision and commitment such as that shown by the founders of the Union. It involves the self-confidence to engage with the world economic forum, the world social forum and others and the self-confidence to say to our friends in the United States that their legitimate sense of vulnerability after 11 September should not lead them in a unilateralist direction – whether in matters relating to military or economic security, the environment or fighting crime. Global problems require global solutions. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President-in-Office, this House will vote tomorrow on an amendment on your National Hydrological Plan, so we hope you enjoy your glass of water today. If the European Union were drawing up an end-of-year report card on the Lisbon process, I suspect that the report would say "must try harder". Over the last year, we have seen some progress on this agenda, in particular the adoption of the telecoms package in Council, the agreement on the European company statute, reduction of the tax burden by three-quarters of 1% of GDP. All of these things help to promote growth and jobs, provided they are consistent with the growth and stability pact, and clearly we need to be shifting the tax burden away from things we want more, like jobs, and onto things that we want less of, like pollution. But I am afraid this report card would also show that the Union is failing in too many areas. The Commission communication to the Barcelona European Council speaks of a firm commitment to the growth and stability pact, which will help build confidence. If this is so, it was sadly lacking when the Finance Ministers fudged an early warning decision on Germany and Portugal just recently. The rejection of the take-over bids directive is a major setback to competitiveness in the Union and I challenge the other political groups and the Council to join us in speeding through the new Commission proposal under a fast-track procedure, so that we can get it onto the statute book by the end of this year. Another area where we have failed is the failure in Council to adopt a common position on the pensions directive which is essential, not just for a secure retirement for an elderly population, but also for labour market mobility. The European Parliament has done its job. We gave you our first reading opinion in July of last year and we now look to the Spanish Presidency to send us a common position by June of this year, if we are to meet the Commission's target of adoption by the end of this year. Another area where the schoolteacher would rap the Council over the knuckles is the European patent. If we want to close the innovation gap between Europe and the United States, we need easier and cheaper and faster pan-European patent protection. When it comes to behaviour in class, I am not sure that the Union would score well. I welcome the Commission's decision this afternoon to take the Council to the Court of Justice for an attempt to take away the Commission's powers over state aid. The reason we have state aid rules is to ensure a proper functioning of the single market and we need to abolish barriers to competition and to free trade to allow the Commission to be the policeman, and the Council should frankly be ashamed of challenging the Commission on that. Finally, our report card would show a pupil which is lacking ambition. If the European Union is to be a star pupil, we need progress on liberalisation of energy and gas markets, on implementation of the financial services action plan, on agreement of a public procurement framework. The process of economic reform is not an end in itself. It is about increasing prosperity of our people and preparing the European Union for enlargement. What message is it that we are sending to applicant states if we are incapable of implementing ourselves the demanding reforms that we are expecting of them? When it comes to reviewing what happens at Barcelona, we will be judging you by the report card. At the moment, the pupil has to work harder.
Watson (ELDR

rapporteur
. – Mr President, my report is a draft response by this Parliament to two legislative acts: a proposed Council framework directive on combating terrorism and a proposed Council framework directive on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States. Together with the creation of the European judicial authority, Eurojust, these two measures form the legislative basis of the European Union's response to the menace of terrorism. The European Union may allow itself a few moments of satisfaction. These measures represent a major step forward towards the creation of a European judicial space. I would like to thank the President-in-Office for reminding us that this judicial space did not start on 11 September last year, although it would be churlish not to recognise that the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September gave a political momentum which allowed us to knock heads together and overcome certain objections. Many of us regret that such a stimulus was needed. Nonetheless we welcome the progress it has brought. What do these measures do? The European arrest warrant applies to a wider range of offences than previous extradition agreements. It makes surrender a judicial, rather than a political process. It largely abolishes the dual incrimination principle. It sets a time limit of 90 days for extradition, giving us the chance to judge all suspects of an offence at the same time. It consolidates the idea of European Union law. The framework decision on terrorism makes terrorism an offence in every country. Currently it has been an offence in only six. It defines for the first time in international law a terrorist act and the offences which constitute a terrorist act. It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties. I commend these measures to the House. The terrorist threat is deadly serious. It requires a serious response. These two measures constitute such a serious response. I regret – and we have in previous debates here regretted – the absence of proper democratic oversight and control of the Union's procedures of law-making in this area. This House argued for the invocation of Article 42 of the Treaty, allowing these measures to be brought within the first pillar. Nonetheless, we recognise that the process of debate has brought improvements, that our amendments at the first reading have introduced certain safeguards into these measures. I welcome the words from the President-in-Office of the Council about closer involvement of Parliament in the process of passing such legislation. Other measures, such as the freezing of assets, have been far less coordinated. Indeed, it is not unfair to say, from reports of Coreper meetings, that the European Union has been all at sea in its approach to freezing of assets and other decisions. The motion for a resolution on the table today reflects that. We know since the end of the 1990s that three phenomena – terrorism, internationally organised crime and corruption – are increasingly linked. What academics have called the terrorist criminal nexus is well established. The fight against the terrorist criminal infrastructure must be our top priority. We know, too, that internationally organised crime is by far the biggest factor, economically and probably politically, in this terrorist criminal nexus. Money laundering represents between 2 and 5% of aggregate global GNP. That is between EUR 500 billion and EUR 1.5 trillion. It is not enough just to freeze assets of terrorist groups. We must fight the economic dimension of terrorism if we are to get on top of the problem. The United Nations has started to do this through its financial action task force. The recommendations from the Washington meeting of 30 October to be implemented by June of this year are essential and provide an area where we can work together with the United States of America in combating this threat. But here I would appeal for the European Union to take the initiative: to take the initiative on ways forward, to try to bring the Americans back into the international community in this fight against terrorism, and to do so within a proper legal framework, with proper democratic and parliamentary control. A number of amendments have been submitted to my report. Amendments Nos 1 and 5 are identical and they cause me no problem. Amendment No 2 which comes subsequent to our adoption of the report in committee seems to be slightly out of context and I recommend a vote against. Amendment No 4 calls for the establishment of a European habeas corpus 
act. My group will support this, as we did in committee, although we consider the reintroduction of the amendment to be rather like adding too much monosodium glutamate to the cooking. But Amendment No 3 is the crux of the debate: the movers say that the European Union should not proceed without the guarantee of adequate standards in procedural law. That means that the Union cannot respond to the terrorist threat. I disagree with them. We must respond. But, in giving our agreement, we do so on the basis of faith that these measures will be rebalanced with procedural guarantees. This matter is very poignant to me personally. Faith is not a comfortable basis on which to proceed in politics. I am aware that my name, and perhaps the name of my party, may be associated with laws that could be used for repressive purposes. I appeal to the Council and Commission, in the spirit of the new relationship that we have between our institutions, to move rapidly to consolidate the necessary move forward in security with measures to promote freedom and justice on which the European Union will be judged. In commending these framework directives to the House, in recommending that we trust the other institutions, I say to them: you are on trial. The European Union is on trial before the court of world democratic opinion. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – High Representative, Commissioner, you have the dubious fortune to live in interesting times, as the Chinese might say. You may be the architects of the Union's awakening in foreign policy. I welcome the meetings that Mr Sharon had last week with Palestinian leaders. I regret that it is the first time since he came to power that he has directly engaged with the Palestinians and I hope it is not mere coincidence that the talks come just before his trip to Washington DC. But it will not be enough to talk about a cease-fire. We need to be talking about an Israeli pullback and an end to the destruction of EUR 17 million worth of EU-funded Palestinian infrastructure. I recommend, High Representative, that if we want peace we do not define any starting date. Nonetheless, the news that some Israeli reservists are reportedly refusing to serve outside the 1967 frontiers is a welcome development. (Applause)
 After all it was similar pressure from reservists that led to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and, taken together with Arafat's expression of willingness of the Palestinians to end the conflict and the need to find creative solutions, these green shoots of optimism need to be nurtured and encouraged to grow. High Representative, you spoke of the Mitchell report and light at the end of the tunnel. I hope this is not the headlamp of an oncoming train. Sometimes America's friends – or so-called friends – in the Middle East have been about as helpful to the peace process as the so-called loyalists in Northern Ireland have proven loyal to the UK Government. The Union has a serious dilemma if it believes that US policy on the Middle East is damaging the entirety of Western interests. I wish you wisdom and courage in your discussions with our friends on the other side of the Atlantic. High Representative, you spoke also about Afghanistan. My group is concerned about reports of interfactional fighting in Northern and Eastern Afghanistan, leading to thousands of Pashtuns fleeing villages, reports of 50 or more people being killed in Gardez. Such reports are an ominous sign and strengthen the case for an international stabilisation force to prevent any possibility of a slide to civil war. Our priority would be to complete the elimination of terrorist networks but in this regard we believe that whatever questions there are over the status of combatants held by the US in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay, they should be treated consistently with the 1949 Geneva Convention. (Applause)
 That Convention was the fourth such to establish principles for the treatment of enemy soldiers and civilians in wartime. I hope that you will support my call for a United Nations committee to review it, to determine whether further changes are needed concerning armed insurgents and terrorists who do not fall within the traditional definitions and, if not, at least call on the Americans to sign the 1977 amendments to extend protection to guerrillas and combatants, amendments which the US has refused thus far to sign. In his state of the union address, President Bush displayed a shocking belligerence. Just as his environmental policies lead to global warming, so his diplomatic and military policies are pushing the world towards a new cold war. In this century every shot the US fires will indeed, in the words of the poet Emerson, "ring round the world" and unless you can appeal to, and nurture, a wider concept of American self-interest, then we risk the menace of a new military millennium. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, on a point of order: it will hardly surprise the House if, on behalf of my Group, I support the position you have taken. But I would nonetheless urge you in your intervention at the European Council in Barcelona to make the point very strongly that we as a House are not happy with the procedure that has been taken and that we hope in the future to see a much more constructive and collaborative approach to us from the other institutions.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on the very calm and efficient way in which you chaired that vote. It augurs well. However, there is hardly any other Parliament which would have voted that number of amendments to a report. Few Members in this House can have been expected to know what they were voting on. They are at the mercy of their colleagues and the whips. The procedure does little to enhance democracy and it is an unedifying and indeed incomprehensible spectacle for citizens who are following our work. (Applause)
 I urge you, in your term in office, to ensure a thorough reform of the decision-making procedures of this Assembly. (Applause)
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President! Prime Minister, you have chosen More Europe as the theme for your presidency. Liberal Democrats hope that this will be reflected in your commitment to enlargement of the European Union. Just as this House insisted on Iberian enlargement some 15 years ago, despite doubts in certain national capitals, so we will militate for an early and successful eastward enlargement in which 2002 will be crucial. We will judge your presidency primarily by your achievements in preparing the reunification of our continent. We wish you success, too, in your efforts to guide smoothly the introduction of the euro. As one who saw in the New Year in France, I am particularly grateful for Spain's role in lending Chirac and Jospin a little small change. Perhaps next time you see Tony Blair you will hand him a few coins as well and ask him whether his indecision is final. British entry into the euro would certainly mean the kind of More Europe we would like to see. (Applause)
 Your vision of the future speaks of new transnational challenges. Relations between India and Pakistan are deeply worrying but Afghanistan must be uppermost in our minds. Soon the bombing must stop and the building must begin. We must respond to the plight of the people through generous giving from our aid budget and more help in patrolling the peace. Your programme speaks of a war against terrorism. This is no conventional war and it will not be won with conventional weapons. Some of us fear that military intelligence, which is leading to bombing and military solutions, may be causing collateral damage and storing up other problems for the future. We hope that Europe can offset this collateral damage by adding to our armoury emotional intelligence, recognising that political problems often require political solutions. You kindly referred to my report on terrorism, adopted on 6 September last year. I would draw your attention, too, to our resolution on cooperation between the United States and the European Union in the fight against terrorism. Liberal Democrats view with deep unease the divergence between the US approach of emergency laws and military tribunals and the rights-based approach that we want for the Union. We insist that you can be both tough on terrorism and true to our Treaties. (Applause)
 You will take forward the building of the area of freedom, security and justice defined in the Amsterdam Treaty. Your presidency programme asserts that current exceptional circumstances require putting security first. If this is true we will nonetheless push you to make sure that freedom and justice are not far behind. In drafting a programme like this any presidency faces a dilemma. We recognise that. A list of priorities soon becomes a universal catalogue. Each Member State brings something different to the party. While we welcome the input that Spain can make to the Barcelona Process and Euro-Med, we are nonetheless fascinated to read in your programme that the European Union's northern dimension is one of your priorities. We will follow development in this matter closely. The reform of the Council that you talk about is most welcome. We hope that you will ensure that the Council abides by its undertaking to allow public access to documents and that it seeks better relations with this House, which, sadly, does not get a mention in your programme until page 20. This House is the true democratic forum of our continent and we want to see its rights respected. If for my Group something is missing in this document it is a recognition of Europe's different regions and cultures. It reads to me as a rather Castilian programme that does not reflect entirely the Spain which I have visited and the Spain that is represented in my Group. What has become of the work of the eminent Director-General in the Commission, Mr Eneko Landaburu? Your second definition of More Europe talks about 'signifying the European nature of Spanish society.' Our second definition of More Europe would be that it signifies the contribution of all Iberian cultures and the flowering thereof among other European cultures in the creation of a Europe whose strength is not that of a monolithic state with deciduous development, but one of unity through diversity. In wishing you every success, Prime Minister, I look forward to a vigorous debate with the Spanish Presidency. (Applause)

 – Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt spoke a lot about the need to improve democratic control. But we do not need to change the Treaties to improve democratic control. We can do that using the existing Treaties. I am not talking about applying Article 42 to bring the third pillar matters into the first pillar, although that would be very desirable. I am talking about instances such as that last week where Parliament was consulted for the fourth time in a year on a text of which half was missing. We were asked to approve a regulation to freeze the assets of a list of terrorist organisations; the list was not attached. The regulation referred to two Council texts, neither of which is available to Parliament. We voted on amendments covering the absent documents in view of the urgency, but if that text is not amended and, in view of this practice, Parliament really should consider recourse to the European Court of Justice unless Council is prepared to treat us in a fairer and more adult way.

 – Madam President, last night two requests were referred to my committee under Rule 112. These relate to re-consultation on two framework decisions from the Council, one on combating terrorism, the other on a proposal for a European arrest warrant. We were asked to treat these as a matter of urgency. My committee met this morning and agreed to propose to the plenary that we agree to urgency for these texts as submitted without report.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – We have become aware since drafting this report that the last phrase in our paragraph 4 is contrary to the provisions that we cite in recital A, referring to Protocol 6 of the ECHR. Therefore, I would like to propose that we replace the last phrase of paragraph 4 with the phrase 'extradition cannot take place where the defendant could be sentenced to capital punishment'. If we use those words, we are in conformity with Protocol 6 which we cite at the beginning.
Watson (ELDR

 rapporteur
. – Mr President, this is a rather strange debate today. Different reports have been put together into an omnibus debate. My report deals with the question of security at summits of the European Union and similar international gatherings and it looks also at the question of citizens' rights. It is important that when Parliament looks at problems that affect the Union, it must do so without victimising individual countries. Just as my recent report on terrorism sought to be a generic report and not one that referred exclusively to the situation in the Basque country in Spain, so this report sets out also to be a generic report and not one that seeks to be particularly critical of any one country. We have seen violent protests at summits in EU countries – in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa. Such protests have been serious, in the last instance resulting in a death. My report has been drawn up in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs and I am pleased to say that it has enjoyed a wide consensus in that committee. I thank my colleagues for the work they have put into it and recommend that they adopt the report as it stands, and vote against the 30 amendments which have been submitted, which seem to me to relate to issues that have already been dealt with in committee. In looking at the problems of violence that we have seen, the European Union must understand the causes of such violent protest and seek to prevent it. There seem to me to be two requirements in this. The first is that we must improve political dialogue on the right to peaceful assembly and to peaceful protest. The second is that we must find a firm, but proportionate, response to criminal behaviour by demonstrators. I note that in Sweden and in Italy judicial proceedings have followed from the violent protests that we saw. The European Union, too, needs to look at whether citizens' rights have been violated, particularly in reference to Article 6 (1) and to Article 7 of our treaties. It must be recalled that Article 7 was strengthened by the European Council in Nice, which instructed the European institutions to monitor the application of fundamental rights even where there is simply a risk of a violation of them. In carrying out such surveillance, institutions must be guided by the European Charter on Fundamental Rights. Hence my report seeks to begin such a study of what has happened and look at whether we have in all cases abided by our commitments. When hundreds of thousands of people representing NGOs and church groups gather on the streets to express their concern and choose to do so at a series of international meetings, it is not just a coincidence. It demands an appropriate response and, indeed, a political response. We must avoid a situation where no answer is given because a society where citizens are afraid of their institutions – and perhaps more importantly institutions are afraid of their citizens – makes for a very weak democracy. In this context I welcome the démarche taken by Mr Guy Verhofstadt in seeking to engage in dialogue with civil society, in advance of the meetings that have been held under the Belgian Presidency. This approach needs to be complemented by a White Paper dealing with globalisation, looking at the European Union's position as a major actor in an area for which the Union is directly responsible and perhaps bringing together a number of Commissioners from different disciplines to look at a global strategy for the European Union. We must look at Article 33 of the Treaty, which gives Member States the task of ensuring the maintenance of law and order, and see whether the responses have been appropriate. The weakness in cooperation between the Member States' law and order authorities is a fundamental weakness of the Union. I hope that we will be able to examine this in the context of the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice. Our citizens must know that they will receive the same treatment from authorities and enjoy the same rights under the law, whichever country they are in and wherever they are exercising their democratic rights.
Watson (ELDR

 – Mr President, I wish to talk specifically about the Council statement which we are expecting on cooperation between the EU and the USA and cooperation in combating terrorism. The events of 11 September were an excruciating flash of light and we had to react immediately. However, we must not be blinded into forgetting that terrorism has been a problem on our continent for many years. After 11 September, I remember Hans Gert Poettering saying here in a memorable debate 'we are all Americans', but we have learned since then that we must first be Europeans. I welcome the Justice and Home Affairs Council's agreement at the weekend on a framework decision on combating terrorism. I welcome the Council's recognition of a European Union legal base for the freezing of assets of groups linked to terrorism and, in particular, yesterday's agreement between Council President Guy Verhofstadt and Prime Minister Berlusconi on a European arrest warrant. Europe has put its house in order. Europe has shown its capacity to act. In tackling terrorism there is a fine balance to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the rights and freedoms which make democracy what it is. The European Union has shown that it can be tough on terrorism and still be true to its treaties and to the values which underpin them. It has recognised that networks of terrorism stretch beyond its borders and that we need cooperation between democracies, particularly across the Atlantic. The next step must be an agreement on better cooperation with the United States. Articles 24 and 28 of the TEU allow us to build a cooperation agreement on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters with our friends in North America. We note that there is a famous exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Verhofstadt – some 40 US proposals on what we could be doing to improve our capacity to fight against terrorism. Most of these can be and I believe are being complied with. Some of them cause a few doubts since the US appears to be asking for things which it does not require in its own laws, such as retention of traffic data. Yet others highlight a difference of legal culture between our democracies. On a visit to Washington DC last week, in talks with senators, congressmen and members of the Administration, I was concerned to learn that the US Patriot Act, adopted by the United States to fight terrorism, appears to discriminate against non-US citizens. We will need to explore with our American friends quite how it affects those from the European Union. I was struck too at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of Attorney General John Ashcroft by the way in which the proposal for military tribunals – the executive order from the President – would provide for hearings in secret, for a prosecution being able to withhold evidence from the defence, for defendants not necessarily having the right to an independent lawyer or to a private conversation with their lawyer, and by how a sentence – including a death sentence – can be passed by a majority of two-thirds of the jurors. Even if we were able to get an agreement on an extradition package in which the US would not apply the death penalty, the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all of our Member States are signatories and on which the Union is founded, would prevent extradition of suspects to appear before such military tribunals. Here, in Europe, we have developed a rights-based approach to international law. We would like a permanent international criminal court to try those guilty of crimes against humanity and we have called on the Americans to join us in that. We recognise that democracies need to work together in the fight against terrorism and other forms of serious cross-border crime. My fear is that, if the US goes down the path of military tribunals, we are on divergent paths. We must make that clear to Mr Ashcroft on his visit to Europe later this week.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Mr President, this debate has been quite unsatisfactory and, under the pertinent rule in our Rules of Procedure, I wish to propose to my committee and to the House that we have a resolution to close this debate, to vote on it at our January part-session, and to look at what further action we need to take, given the quite unsatisfactory nature of the responses from the Council and Commission.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – Colleagues will recall that we dealt with this matter in urgent procedure in October. I am pleased to be able to report that the Council has now accepted the legal base that was being proposed. However, we would contest the fact that neither of the two appendices is attached to the proposal, although we understand the reasons why. Nonetheless, we discussed this in committee last night and we recognise the urgency. We would propose an urgent procedure without report. It would then be up to the political groups to put forward amendments, which might be similar to those we adopted in October.
Watson (ELDR
). 
 – I certainly share the concern that Enrique Barón Crespo has raised at the failure of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers to reach agreement on the proposal for a European arrest warrant. I note, however that, in addition to Mr Verhofstadt's planned visit to Rome, there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers on Thursday of this week. It must be hoped that agreement can be reached on that occasion. The House anticipated that an agreement might not be reached and recommended at least consideration of the use of Article 40 of the Treaty which would allow a number of countries to proceed on the basis of reinforced cooperation. Nobody wants that solution; it must be hoped that we can reach agreement between 15, but, one country must not be allowed to hold up progress in the fight against terrorism called for by the Heads of State and Government in Ghent. (Applause from the left and the centre)
Watson (ELDR

rapporteur
. – Madam President, it is a matter of regret and perhaps even of shame that it took the events of 11 September to push European governments into tackling effectively a problem which has plagued our continent for over a generation. In 1997 in Amsterdam, and again in 1999 in Tampere in Finland, the Heads of State and Government committed themselves to tackling terrorism. Our review of progress early this year showed that they had done nothing about it, which was why we as a Parliament brought forward a report calling on them to take action. The events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America. I would like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in drawing up this report, particularly the Members from Spain. In my report, I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant. The amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross-border criminal offences, and if I may quote Amendment No 16, it specifies those crimes "which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms, democracy, respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based". We seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents, by reinforcing the principle of ne bis in idem
, by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so, including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death. Moreover, we seek to provide aids to victims of terrorism and their families. I shall ask the House to accept one amendment, which was submitted after the deadline and which takes account of the most recent developments in Council. One Member State is threatening to block progress towards a European arrest warrant. There is a method – not one which I recommend – but one which may be needed in extremis
, in order to press ahead, and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States. Terrorism is a supranational challenge and calls for a supranational response. We cannot allow the blockage of one Member State to prevent common action in fighting it. When we met in this Chamber, on 12 September, we had a debate in which I remember Mr Poettering and many others said that we were all Americans. Since then, we have discovered that we must first be Europeans. We acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other's systems, but not blind trust, and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States, to encourage benchmarking, to encourage exchange of best practice. The process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice is similar to that of creating the single market, but it is more urgent and, moreover, we are dealing not with the freedom of movement of goods, services or capital, but with the freedom of people. The Greens and other political groups are saying, don't go ahead until you are sure that everybody's judicial standards are perfect. Majority opinion, however, on the Committee recognises that the scope of the challenge we face and the historical imperative are such that we must press ahead with these measures with prudence, and with vigilance, but also with determination. We must ensure effective action against terrorists and yet we must not deny legitimate political expression of grievances. I was surprised to read in El País this morning an interpretation of one amendment, which I support, that it would outlaw Herri Batasuna. I do not interpret the amendment in this way, nor would such an amendment be necessary to target those involved in supporting terrorist acts. Other provisions in what we are proposing do that. I would say to colleagues, and particularly to our Spanish colleagues, that in our determination to tackle terrorism, we must acknowledge that terrorists sometimes express political grievances, and that these require a political response. Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission; Parliament, which desperately needs powers of codecision, may be reconsulted on this matter. We are determined to assist governments in their work and yet maintain the delicate balance between the security needs of our citizens and preservation of their democratic freedoms. In this, cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs has received quite a boost. Whatever it was that we planned at Amsterdam, the paradox is that events are what drives Europe forward: just as Mr Haider's election led us to adopt effective legislation against racism and xenophobia, so it may be that Mr bin Laden has done much for European Union integration. May I say, finally, what a pleasure it is to see you as a fellow Liberal Democrat in the Chair in this session. I wish you a successful debate.
