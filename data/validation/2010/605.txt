 This report on small-scale coastal fishing, artisanal fishing and the reform of the common fisheries policy is important because it underlines the importance of ‘small-scale’ fishing in the EU, particularly in terms of job creation, regional diversity and development, and because it marks Parliament’s general refusal to privatise access to fish stocks, refers to the need for a flexible definition of artisanal fishing (what is small-scale in the Netherlands is not small-scale in Greece) and supports the application of environmental and social criteria for determining access to fisheries resources and market distortion. However, the final version of the motion for a resolution crosses a line of acceptability in advocating support to cover sudden short-term increases in fuel prices. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is firmly opposed to support of this kind. I therefore abstained from the vote. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution, as it does not sufficiently address gender parity. One of its recommendations is that the Member States should propose both a male and a female candidate for the post of Commissioner, which is a positive step However, there is no requirement for gender parity in the drawing-up of lists or in the final results, even though this is of vital importance considering that only 30 % of MEPs are women.

 This resolution consents to the amendment of the Annexes to the Protocols to the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel. These purely technical amendments do not pose any problems as such. I voted against this resolution, however, because the vote in itself is a very bad signal from Parliament at a time when the Gaza Strip was being bombed by the State of Israel as part of Operation Pillar of Defence.

 After a heated debate on shale gas extraction, and a great deal of back and forth in the Chamber, during which, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I expressed my strong opposition and outlined the concerns of developing countries, particularly in terms of land grabbing and access to water, fertile soil and food, which potentially call into question their food sovereignty. Today we voted on the two reports of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE Committee) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, at last adopting an EP position on this highly controversial subject. Although the ITRE report was in favour of shale gas, totally irresponsible and unacceptable, Mr Sonik’s report was more open to discussion. In the end, I abstained in the final vote on this report. The reasons are simple: on the one hand, this report rightly favours the adaptation of the European regulations, and demonstrates the EP’s desire to provide a framework for fracturing and to respond to the challenges; on the other hand, the moratorium, or more precisely the proposed amendment urging the Member States not to authorise any further hydraulic fracturing in the EU, was rejected. In any event, I am completely opposed to shale gas extraction. Catherine Grèze,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development
. − (FR)
 Madam President, I am absolutely against the extraction of shale gas. These are matters that go way beyond our European borders with appalling effects on our water resources. Imagine yourselves what the consequences could be, and how devastating they could be, in developing countries where access to water is vital. But the extraction of shale gas is also about land grabbing and poor land quality; in other words, it brings into question food sovereignty in many countries. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, despite the publicity, despite the brazen lobbying that has been carried out even at the very door of the hemicycle, I would urge you to shoulder your responsibilities. We need a binding legal framework for European businesses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Catherine Grèze,

 Madam President, Mr Szymański, are you really asking me to choose between the lesser of two evils? It is like choosing between the plague and cholera. Allow me to ask in return whether you are aware that in a large number of developing countries there is no water? Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

. – (FR)
 Madam President, what an honour to have to reply to all of these questions! Regarding the point about which developing countries are carrying out research on shale gas extraction, as far as I know countries including South Africa and Morocco have already undertaken some research. But you can reply on multinationals the world over to seek out the last drop of a resource wherever it may be. On the issue of water, raised by my colleague, and the impact on water resources, it seems we have different sources of information. I saw an excellent film, Gasland
, which is worth seeing, and which showed the truly dramatic consequences, no pun intended, on water resources and human and animal health in the United States, which as you know is a highly developed and technologically advanced country. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) has become a very important subject in the debate on EU development policy. The Treaty of Lisbon makes eradication of poverty an overall goal of EU development policy (Article 21) and, with the aim of achieving this goal, states the need for a coherent approach in terms of EU external action, covering trade, agriculture, fisheries, climate change and tax havens (Article 208). Unfortunately, the report in question is not an evaluation of implementation of PCD or its weaknesses. Rather, it is a report on what PCD should be. There are positive elements in the report, such as recognition of the right of developing countries to define their own policies by democratic means and to protect their economy. However, I could not allow myself, in the name, indeed, of genuine Policy Coherence for Development, to vote in favour of a resolution that encourages the expansion of agri-fuels in developing countries and supports agro-industry. That contributes towards land grabbing and runs wholly contrary to the notion of food sovereignty. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

This text rejects the arbitrary cuts proposed by the Member States for the 2013 budget. In its proposal, which Parliament supports, the Commission called for an increase in payments in order to meet budgetary commitments and outstanding payments from previous years. I abstained in the vote, however, because it supports the funding for the ITER nuclear fusion programme, a pipe dream that is a money pit for the European budget. At the same time, the report calls for cuts in certain lines, including some that are linked to development cooperation. I also voted in favour of amendments that sought to use the nuclear funds to finance programmes to dismantle plants, though these were rejected. I abstained on the amendments calling for a reduction in the subsidies for tobacco production. These reductions would have a severe impact on small farmers. Unless we call for a ban on the production and marketing of tobacco, this reduction would be counterproductive. Finally, I abstained, too, on the amendments calling for a single seat for the European Parliament. We need to have a real debate on that subject, not just a few amendments, as is the case here.

I voted for this report, which emphasises the European Parliament’s strong and united position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the years 2014-2020 in the run-up to the November European Council on this issue. The report reiterates our support for a 5 % increase in the budget in relation to 2013, that is to say, an additional EUR 100 billion. The multiannual financial framework is Europe’s only way out of the current crisis. Given the stakes, it must be up to the task and it must finance the commitments made by all of the European institutions, particularly in the areas of climate, development assistance, research, employment and the fight against poverty. In addition to the issue of the percentage, the other main problem is that of the EU’s own resources. In that regard, too, Parliament sets out a united position in favour of the creation of new own resources, such as the Financial Transaction Tax. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The European Parliament has just approved the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA), which will be annexed to the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel. This agreement, as adopted, does not guarantee that the products that arrive on our market will not be partly manufactured in the settlements, contrary to the provisions of European and international law. Let us not forget that the European Union condemns Israel’s settlement policy, which it considers to be illegal, and that it decided in 2009 to suspend any upgrade of relations with Israel (following the launch of Operation Cast Lead against Gaza). We are therefore sending out mixed messages, which are contradictory and difficult to understand. It is for this reason that I voted against the adoption of the agreement. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted in favour of the report by Charles Goerens on the future of development policy as it seems to me to be positive on the whole. The aim of the report is to refocus the discussion on the priority aspects of development policy, in particular the criteria for public development aid, independent strategic reflection, the issue of differentiation (emerging countries) and aid for local trade. I am particularly happy about the positive vote on the paragraph introduced by the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the Committee on Development, which aims to refocus aid for trade facilitation instruments, which currently targets the export sectors, so that it also supports local and regional trade.

 Until now, the number of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of energy is unknown, as Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of such agreements. According to the Commission, Member States are becoming increasingly obliged to accept regulatory concessions, which is incompatible with European law on the matter. In addition, as the Commission does not know exactly how much energy is being imported, it cannot provide for market fluctuations or the means to alleviate them. Consequently, the Commission has proposed to put in place an information exchange mechanism with regard to energy agreements with third countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tried to strengthen the proposal by allowing the Commission to have access to agreements before they are signed, in order to be able to advise Member States on their compatibility with the law. Such a measure would also strengthen transparency. The Member States did not want this, and the rapporteur did not seem to care, preferring a bad agreement to no agreement on the subject at all. I personally voted against this text. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently three quality labels for agricultural products in the European Union (protected geographical indications (PGI), protected designations of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG)). The Commission wishes to reform this system in order to simplify or facilitate new entries, in particular. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it was important to take advantage of this overhaul to promote the introduction of a new ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label. We also called for the introduction of a ‘mountain’ label to highlight the considerable added value of products from these regions, where agriculture is often traditional and extensive. These two measures were passed during the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we are pleased about that. However, during the negotiations in trialogue with the Council and the Commission, the Members representing Parliament sacrificed the ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label, which is nonetheless important for encouraging these kinds of agricultural practices. That is why I voted against this text, which was initially encouraging. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Although the free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia/Peru should be ratified shortly, Parliament has just voted on a text establishing safeguard clauses for the banana sector. The safeguard clauses enable us to temporarily reinstitute normal customs duties or to suspend tariff liberalisation. The text recognises that there are problems in terms of employment rights in the countries concerned, although this recognition is not sufficient. The rapporteur also calls for greater consideration of social and environmental aspects within the framework of the forthcoming economic liberalisation. The Commission must understand this message. Moreover, the texts clearly state the need for greater consideration of overseas countries, where bananas are a pillar of the economy. This vote should not make us forget that the real issue for these regions is a transition towards a more diversified and more sustainable economy. For all of these reasons, I voted in favour of this report. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The matter at issue here is the future of the seas. The Salavrakos report deserves to be supported for its long-term perspective on the sustainable development of fishing in the EU, but we cannot allow it to be watered down in this way. I shall explain what I mean by this: Amendment 2, which was adopted with the help of the regionalists who swung the vote, has destroyed the call to allow fish stocks to increase to levels above those capable of producing a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This means that the EU has failed to meet even the requirements of international law. I therefore ended up voting against this text, for, although it does take account of some important aspects (ceilings for the renewal of fleet, areas for repopulating fish), it does not take sufficient account of numerous points including overfishing and the objectives set by the common fisheries policy.

 The Commission is proposing that Member States grant decoupled support to vine growers under the direct payments scheme. In practical terms, that will allow Member States to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the common agricultural policy (CAP) direct payments scheme (first pillar). That is positive, as the payments will now be granted for an indefinite period, which will allow small farmers to predict their incomes over the period and therefore gain stability. The introduction of this mechanism will, however, require some adjustments. This resolution will allow Member States to test this new mechanism for a period of one year prior to its definitive implementation, if they so desire. That is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this resolution which makes recommendations for improving animal welfare in Europe. Despite the fact that unfortunately it does not call clearly for a reduction in transport time, it does limit the duration of transport of live animals to eight hours as requested in a recent petition on this matter. Similarly, the text calls for the inclusion of animal welfare standards in trade agreements signed by the EU. Although this resolution is not perfect, it is a first encouraging sign which, I hope, will lead to a genuine proposal for a regulation from the Commission. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The Council conclusions are mixed. Symbolically, they point towards greater solidarity and integration, the only means of tackling this interminable economic crisis, which is a good thing. However, only around 10 billion of the 120 initially promised by the Compact for Growth and Jobs are genuinely new and additional funds. Furthermore, the conclusions still have ‘growth’ as their leitmotiv. This is seen as the sole remedy to all our economic ills. This rhetoric is unacceptable as far as we, as ecologists, are concerned. What we should be questioning is our model of development as a whole and we should bear in mind the fact that resources are finite. The conclusions of the Summit do not do this, or do it very little. Given these mixed findings, I abstained from voting on this resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I signed this resolution calling for all public consultations to be translated into all of the languages recognised by the countries of the European Union. There is a European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that calls for resolute action to be taken to promote these languages, to prohibit any form of discrimination against them and even to facilitate and encourage their use in public life. This resolution responds precisely to this last point. Such a measure would encourage citizens to address the European Union. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 We have been asked to express an opinion on reprioritising our development cooperation with Latin America. I voted in favour of Mr Cortés Lastra’s report as it highlights the need to move towards renewed cooperation with Latin America. This is a chance for the EU to stop with the neoliberal policies of the past. Promoting growth does not provide prosperity for all. Social cohesion is key to this process. Growth and the fight against poverty cannot be systematically linked. The EP will soon be questioned about its approval of the free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru and on the association agreement with Central America. They go completely against the objectives of our development policy. The European Commission has always mistakenly interpreted development policy through the prism of international trade. It is time we turned this logic on its head and focused mainly on coherent development policies in any agreement. The report rightly points out the need for all EU policies to be coherent and for systematic compliance with environmental and social standards, while including civil society.

 As regards this road map for energy cooperation with third countries, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance succeeded in having a number of amendments incorporated, notably on reducing dependence on imports through greater input from renewable energies, the need to align the long-term climate and energy policy objectives, the need to ensure sustainable energy supply at local level in developing countries, and the need to be more sceptical about the use of agrofuels. However, I could not vote for this report, which promotes shale gas and oil sands and which supports projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

 I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe as it was essential for us to send out a strong message against the homophobic laws that have been recently adopted, or are in the process of being adopted in certain countries, particularly at the very heart of Europe, where homosexuality is criminalised. The European Parliament, as a great defender of fundamental rights, had a duty to examine and condemn these extremely worrying laws that demonstrate the increasing homophobia that can be seen today in Europe. It is utterly scandalous that the authorities should justify these laws by saying that they are necessary to protect public morality, while they restrict freedom of expression and are totally discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. How is it possible to consider demonstrations, support for, or the mere acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as ‘homosexual propaganda’? For the first time since the last European elections, all of the main political groups have come to an agreement: we are saying ‘no to homophobic laws’ and we clearly condemn any discrimination, hate speech or violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

 We had the opportunity to prevent the disappearance of bluefin tuna, and the EU, the main exploiter of this species, also had the opportunity to assume its responsibilities. It is regrettable, however, that the European Parliament did not succeed in adopting more ambitious measures to address the plight of this iconic endangered species. The new legislation, which I certainly could not vote against, is only the bare minimum, but it will at least make it possible to enforce existing international standards. Although the European Union has just complied with the commitments made within the framework of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), we are still far from taking the necessary measures. Measures should have been taken, for example, to close zones to fishing, especially during the spawning season. In addition, stricter measures should have been adopted concerning illegal fishing and overfishing in particular, in order to fill certain gaps, which are currently exacerbating the problem of the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It may not be too late, and the EU will once again have the opportunity to enforce more stringent regulations this November. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this report recommending the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) at EU level and therefore supporting the draft directive presented by the Commission last September. The FTT is an excellent instrument for raising new revenue to finance stimulus policies. It is one of the best ways of going beyond the austerity policies that are leading Europe straight into disaster, driving too many of Europe’s citizens into poverty and leading to political and democratic stalemate, the magnitude of which is still not being acknowledged by some. However, I regret that the European Parliament has granted an exemption to pension funds. It is the wrong signal, especially since these funds – which are long-term investors – are only marginally affected by the tax, which mostly penalises short-term players. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted against this report, as it calls for special attention and financial support for regional airports, without a single condition with regard to security or even the environment. Before the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed various amendments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving multimodality (better coordination with rail transport) and developing better cooperation between regional airports that are geographically close to each other but are situated in different (cross-border) countries. These amendments were all rejected, leaving me with no choice but to vote against the report. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Amazonian countries are confronted with illegal mining, which is synonymous with the ecological and social violation of indigenous territories, with tragic consequences. At the end of August, Survival
, an NGO, provided information concerning the massacre by miners of several dozen Yanomami Indians on Venezuelan territory. Today, however, the Venezuelan Government believes there to be no evidence. Since then, voices have been raised, including that of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, denouncing the lack of will on the part of local authorities to conduct an investigation and calling for an in-depth investigation. I hope that the European Union will expressly call on the Venezuelan Government to shed light on this tragedy to the fullest extent. However, those of us who are directly concerned, through our overseas territories, send a strong message calling for the full recognition of the rights of indigenous people. Starting today, let us put an end to the illegal exploitation of mineral and forest resources. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 days ago, we were hoping that Rio+20 would be the summit that would destabilise those who profit from greater inequality and deplete our resources. We are bitterly disappointed at the lack of binding objectives. However, this should not divert us from our commitments. If we want to see future progress in the negotiations, we need to prove that the fight against poverty and for sustainable development is the true objective of EU development policy, and we need to do so through the allocation of ambitious financial resources. Let us make a commitment to implement, without delay, innovative financing mechanisms, such as the financial transaction tax, and to redirect a substantial proportion of revenues towards development aid. Let us fight more effectively against tax havens and their hoarding of the fiscal resources of those countries through the excessive use made of them by transnational corporations and, in particular, the extractive industries. Only then can we become credible advocates of sustainable development for all. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some satisfaction that I present this report on tax and development to you tonight. It represents an important stage in a battle that began a long time ago, which I am now pursuing in the European Parliament. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Development, with whom the work has been extremely productive. I hope that it will find confirmation during tomorrow’s votes. Developing countries have been very badly hit by the financial and economic crisis and the rising prices of agricultural materials and now need substantial new sources of funding more than ever. Amid this context of global crisis, tax revenue, which is the oldest source of development funding, is a major issue and a genuine challenge. Effective taxation systems not only provide funding for vital public services. By promoting the transparent, responsible use of government revenue, they are also one of the foundations of a responsible democracy. Contributing towards raising equitable, progressive and transparent taxes should in no way lead to removing or reducing official development assistance (ODA). It should not provide a further excuse for Member States that are increasingly inclined to reduce their share of GDP which is devoted to ODA. Whilst ODA may be imperfect and have much room for improvement, it is no less vital for countries that have been severely affected by both economic and climate-related crises. It is not a question of replacing aid, therefore, but of redirecting it towards developing effective taxation systems, to which the multinationals must contribute on the basis of their actual profits. In this way, poor countries will be able to take ownership of their development once again, reduce poverty and compensate for the loss of customs revenue caused by the liberalisation of the markets, so that in the long term, they will be able to manage without foreign aid. However, the countries of the South are not only victims of their own ineffective taxation systems. They are also victims of the tax dumping imposed by the Bretton Woods bodies, of the cost of illicit capital flight, and of tax havens. Every year, they sustain colossal losses of tax revenue estimated at over ten times the amount of aid they receive from rich countries. This report emphasises this fact. As for the OECD guidelines, far from being adequate, they actually pose a threat. By allowing non-cooperative jurisdictions to be taken off the grey lists simply by signing cooperation agreements without imposing any automatic exchange of information, they are creating the illusion that tax havens are legitimate and conferring credibility on a system that is harmful to public finances in North and South alike. Putting an end to tax havens is a vital step towards these countries’ development, and the European Union must make it an absolute priority. The EU must shoulder its responsibilities as the United States has done and produce clear, binding legislation coupled with genuine sanction mechanisms in order to put an end to tax havens, which are like weapons of mass destruction for the development of poor countries. The EU must prevent profit and transfer price manipulation by companies, especially European companies, which both benefit from and abuse detrimental taxation systems. It must impose the introduction of a transparent, binding international mechanism that will place a duty on all multinational companies, especially those in the extractive industries, to automatically declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. This is a vital first step towards stopping those who are getting rich on the back of the Southern countries’ misery. It is also a vital step towards restoring the European Union’s credibility. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these partnership agreements between the European Union, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo should, in principle, turn out to be good news for these populations, and good news for biodiversity. However, this is only one stage in a long process which the European Parliament will follow closely. If we want this agreement to allow for the introduction of a regulated, transparent and environmentally friendly timber trade which benefits local populations, rather than a few groups of dubious legality, the European Union must ensure that the rights of the local and indigenous populations are fully respected and that the latter actually participate in the consultations. It must help strengthen the capabilities of all those involved; it must contribute to the fight against corruption and to the introduction of real forest governance. The agreements must not be a pretext for continuing to pillage the natural resources of developing countries. Rather, they must help restore a balance in relations between the European Union and these countries. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, following our visit to Gaza from 26-28 May 2010, our delegation unanimously called for an immediate, total and permanent lifting of the blockade imposed by Israel. Our joint resolution was born out of this unanimity faced with this humanitarian and political tragedy, and I hope that a large majority will vote for it. Conveying our message with one voice is not just necessary, it is vital, because it is precisely unity that the European Union has lacked until now and it is precisely unity that it needs today in order to carry weight and to make its presence felt as a major and credible actor for peace. For Europe, the worst thing would be if the flotilla tragedy were to be followed by indifference and inaction caused by a lack of unity. There needs to be a political reaction by Europe. It no longer simply has the right, but the duty, to act and hold talks as well as to condemn and impose sanctions when peace is threatened by one side or the other. Madam High Representative, we have a huge responsibility today. We can no longer content ourselves with reconstructing buildings time and again. We must build peace and we must do so now. That demands courage and firmness. You must build alliances, with the United States and Turkey in particular, and you must not relieve the diplomatic pressure on Israel until the complete lifting of the blockade and the setting up of an independent international inquiry become a reality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to Mr Domenici’s efforts, the report on which we have to take a final vote this week is a high quality document. I sincerely hope that it will be adopted on Wednesday at our plenary sitting. Many of the advances that it contains on the issues of financial transparency, fiscal policy and the fight against tax havens, the major consequences of which are rightly stressed here, are simply without precedent. First, we should welcome the fact that the text acknowledges the considerable limits of the fight against tax havens as it has been carried out until now. Tax treaties and the OECD lists of non-cooperative jurisdictions, to reproduce the terms officially in use, are unsatisfactory and even represent part of the problem that they are meant to be solving. That is why the proposals in this report, which aim to go beyond this approach, to adopt a new definition of tax havens and to introduce new tools – including sanctions − to help in this fight are hugely important. This is obviously the case for the proposal to introduce automatic exchange of tax information, both within the European Union and at international level. It is also the case for country-by-country accounting, which the report is demanding and which will make it possible to measure the real activities of companies in the countries in which they are established and to verify that they do indeed pay the taxes which they legitimately owe there. These are two fundamental demands which have long been supported by many experts. We can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is adopting them and, in so doing, will become one of the institutions that is most involved in this fight. Ladies and gentlemen, the problem of tax havens is not a mere technical issue. It relates to fundamental choices. Do we wish to give developing countries the means to benefit from their own resources instead of seeing these confiscated? Do we wish to ensure that all of our companies and our fellow citizens contribute within their means to the financing of civic life? By voting for Mr Domenici’s report, we will be giving a positive answer to these two questions. An answer of which, I believe, we can only be proud. On a personal level, I would like to thank Mr Kovács for the seminar that we jointly organised in Brussels on 9 December to put this subject on the agenda. Thank you and good luck. Eva Joly,

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this new humanitarian crisis that Haiti is enduring is perhaps on a greater scale than all previous ones, so much so that I doubt that it is possible to find the right words to talk about the victims, to speak to the survivors and to reach out to families in order to tell them how much we share their pain and are aware of our responsibility. However violent the earthquake was, it alone does not explain the extent of the damage. The latter is also linked to the chronic poverty that Haiti has endured for many years. Until now, the international community has been incapable of changing anything there. Worse, by imposing policies on Haiti that we now know did not work, international institutions, Europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric, its economy and its institutions. In the 1970s, Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned. It used to produce 90% of its agricultural needs. Today, it imports more than half. This must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production. Before this earthquake, Haiti was a country without resources because it was deprived of the resources to which it was entitled. We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies. From this point of view, we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place. In future, we must improve our procedures. However, we must, above all, be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong. We must proceed by calling our own methods into question, and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term. The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti, and the Member States have done the same. We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term, and EUR 200 million for long-term needs. I would like to compare these figures to other figures, to the USD 155 billion that the banks of the City and Wall Street are getting ready to pay to a few thousand people who work in the banks. That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level. Urgent humanitarian aid is necessary, but it alone is not enough. It must not, under any circumstances, supplant development aid, which itself must not be experienced by the countries that are supposed to benefit from it as a veritable diktat. The first way of assisting countries in great difficulty is to continue to respect them, to allow them to benefit from their own resources. We must cancel Haiti’s debt and pay off our debt to that country. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head. (Applause) Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face: the economic and financial crisis, the social or food crisis, climate change, energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty. The dominant economic model that is the unbridled free market, and our lifestyles, have not just shown their limitations, but have actually caused these unprecedented multidimensional crises. We must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies. The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision. The main imperative to respect is consistency. European Union trade policy, fisheries and agriculture must be designed consistently and in such a way as to ensure sustainable development, to fight poverty and guarantee a decent standard of living and income for everyone. I am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today. By making trade an end in itself, and not a means to serve its development policy, the European Union is sacrificing the populations of developing countries for the benefit of its multinationals. Therefore, negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements are quite rightly causing controversy amongst the governments of the ACP, unions and civil society, which see them as a threat to their economies. Agriculture is one of the most problematic issues and remains tragically neglected in cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries. Although rural areas and this sector represent more than 60% of the population and their jobs, their share of the European funds for ACP countries is virtually non-existent. This must change. How can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority? Agriculture must be at the heart of the European Union’s development policies. Helping developing countries together with local farmers to ensure they have food sovereignty is quite simply essential, all the more so because, today, food sovereignty, like the democratic legitimacy of these countries’ governments, is threatened by a new and particularly worrying phenomenon, the acquisition of arable land by foreign investors following the rise in food prices in 2007. China, Saudi Arabia and even Qatar now own thousands of hectares in developing countries. The European Union and the ACP countries must tackle this matter, which is likely to create violent conflicts and hunger riots, in particular, by making access to natural resources such as land and water a fundamental and inalienable right of local populations. Another matter that is close to my heart is that of tax havens. The repercussions of these are bad enough for developed countries, but are even worse for the economies and the political institutions of developing countries. The illicit financial flows that they allow are thought to account for as much as ten times the amount of official development assistance. Stopping this haemorrhage is a question of consistency and credibility. A first step could be the signing of a binding agreement, requiring multinationals to automatically declare their profits and the taxes paid in every country in which they operate, thus limiting the abuses and the losses sustained by developing countries. Finally, I would like to use this debate to stress once more the democratic deficit of this revision, which our parliaments were not consulted on. The role of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly must, however, be strengthened. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the negotiators will seize the opportunity they are being given to make the necessary amendments to this partnership and to make it a success of which the principal beneficiaries will be the populations of the ACP countries. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Cotonou agreements, poverty has not subsided. We have therefore failed in our development mission. Something has to change with this second revision. I am pleased to say that there is a fairly broad consensus on the measures that I am proposing, and I think that one of the measures that we can use to eradicate poverty is to really combat tax havens, and to use this instrument to do what we can. Within the European Union and in the ACP region, we can force multinationals to declare, on a country-by-country basis, how much they earn and how much tax they pay. That is also an international demand. However, many years will go by before this demand is met at international level. So let us use the opportunities that we have within this agreement to establish this rule in Europe. This is why I am asking you to reject the proposed amendment to paragraph 16, but to preserve the initial wording, which calls on us to put our own house in order. In the same vein, what we can do is also force our own investment bank to take action with regard to tax havens. We should prohibit European Development Fund investments in companies that do not make profits in the countries in which they operate, but prefer to make profits in tax havens. This was the case in Zambia, where very substantial investments – to the tune of USD 46 million, I believe – were made in the Mopani mine, for example. This has done nothing to improve the lives of Zambians; rather, it has improved the lives of the shareholders who have benefited from this aid. It is therefore totally counterproductive. This is within our power. We can change the mandate of our bank. Let us therefore do what we can and put nothing off until tomorrow. Let us take action in this regard. Then, there are principles to which we should remain totally committed: human rights and migrant rights, and I urge you to retain my proposed wording of Article 31 and not quell the protests against bilateral agreements which, in reality, constitute an outsourcing of migratory flows. (Applause) Eva Joly,

Mr President, Mr Carlgren, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the world’s future will be at stake in Copenhagen, but before that, it is the credibility of the European Union, as the global leader in the fight against global warming, that will be at stake at the end of October in Brussels. The Member States must make climate-related financing proposals that are proportionate for a tragic situation. Together with the commitment – which I hope will be ambitious – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the issue of financing and of reducing and adapting to climate change in developing countries will represent a major theme in the forthcoming negotiations. The figures speak for themselves: 100 countries, most of them poor, account for only 3% of global emissions. Although developing countries have contributed the least to these greenhouse gas emissions, they are already the worst affected. According to a recent report by Oxfam, 26 million people have already been forced to migrate due to the effects of climate change or other forms of environmental damage. By 2050, these climate refugees could number more than 200 million. The effects of climate change could destroy the progress made in some developing countries and could quite simply prevent the Millennium Development Goals from being achieved. This is therefore not a question of charity. It is a question of us accepting our full responsibility and laying the foundations for a fair and peaceful world. The European Union’s current strategy is unworthy of the ambitions declared by the leaders of environmental diplomacy. It must lay its cards on the table now in order to relaunch the negotiations. The Union cannot reasonably pledge less than EUR 35 billion in public finances. It goes without saying that these funds can only supplement those already pledged for official development assistance, all the more so because the commitments made in this area are not always honoured by our Member States. Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our planet is in our hands. If we do not stop the damage being done to our environment and the inequalities, we can fear the worst. We have a choice between an ambitious and proactive Europe and a timid Europe that is aligned with the United States, which cares little about the fate of developing countries. I urge you to make the right choice. Eva Joly,

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, democracy and human rights are inextricably linked. It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised. We must therefore welcome the fact that, on 19 May, the Council indicated that the European Union had to adopt a more consistent approach to democratic governance. The efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a striking example of this. Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock. Where is the European Union’s consistency and credibility when its own decisions contrast so sharply with its much-vaunted principles? And what can be said of the Member States that refuse to endorse the Goldstone report? Its conclusions are fair and balanced, and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace. It is this hope that the major powers are destroying, and they are destroying it through their lack of courage and their lack of loyalty to their own values. Organising election observation missions is therefore not enough, especially when one refuses afterwards to acknowledge the result. We must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues. The Council should swiftly adopt a programme of action along these lines, with the creation of a genuine strategy for human rights, which would be imperative at all levels of the EU. We need to outline our priorities clearly and integrate them formally into all of our instruments: foreign policy, human rights policy and development policy. What kind of monitoring will we carry out in those third countries in which the European Union observes the elections in order to ensure respect for political pluralism and the involvement of civil society in the long term? What are our demands as regards the establishment of an independent judiciary and of institutions that are transparent and accountable to their citizens? The persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive. It is time to clear this up if we want the European Union and its most fundamental values to be taken more seriously at international level. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we wish the following phrase to be added to point A:  ‘as well as on the developing countries’, so that this reads ‘to analyse and evaluate the extent of the social, economic and financial crisis, its impact on the Union and its Member States, as well as on the developing countries’. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, we also want to include a reference to ‘development cooperation’ so the sentence reads: ‘To analyse and evaluate the current implementation of Community legislation in all the areas concerned, including development cooperation’.

Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea. The violence that was used against the opponents and, in particular, women, is utterly appalling and unacceptable. I wish to express my support for the victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones’ remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre. In addition to the current measures being initiated by the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the Guinean Government by rejecting the Report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Guinea, which we will vote on during the next plenary session. The Committee on Development already unanimously rejected, in September, this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea, expressing doubts over the use of the funds allocated by the European Union. Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population, the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims’ wounds are still fresh. Doing so would send out the wrong message to the Guinean Government. It would be a scandal which I cannot bring myself to endorse. Eva Joly,

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, while I have the pleasure of putting this oral question to you on behalf of the Committee on Development, sadly I do not have the pleasure of presenting you with the resolution on the same subject, adopted unanimously by this committee. My colleagues from the Committee on Development and I worked tirelessly to ensure that the resolution was voted on and debated in plenary before the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. However, apart from my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, no other political group supported our request to put this resolution on the agenda, and yet it is vital if we want the European Parliament to play more of a part in defining the European Union’s external policy and to have real strength behind its proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, of what benefit will it be to us to vote on this resolution, which was to put the European Parliament’s requests and proposals to the members of the G20 and, more specifically, to those of our Member States who sit on it, as well as to the European Commission, at the October plenary session, that is, after the Pittsburgh Summit? Besides the fact that this devalues the work accomplished, we cannot be content with this role of current affairs commentator either. That is not our job. Let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism: journalists. Developing countries need us now more than ever. While our fellow citizens have not been spared, the global economic and financial crisis has had a far more lasting effect on the populations of developing countries. However, the financial institutions have not made these populations the main beneficiaries of the emergency loans, since very few of them satisfy the required conditions. The countries of Africa have thus received only 1.6% of the loans granted by the IMF since the last G20 meeting in London and the increase in the IMF’s resources. The rest has gone to developed countries, European ones in particular. Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course, but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility. Public development aid must be increased as a matter of urgency. Already, most of the Member States do not meet the conditions required by the OECD since 1970, and we are facing new emergencies without having new funds. We must therefore find new sources of funding, not least by reforming the current system. The Committee on Development is asking you to take action to eradicate tax haven abuses, tax evasion and the illegal flows of capital from developing countries. According to a Norwegian report published in June, the figures of which have been verified, the illegal flows leaving developing countries are ten times the amount of our development aid. This shows just how much is at stake. There is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay, on a country by country basis, in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. Moreover, a radical reform of the system must take place involving, in particular, the introduction of new democratic and transparent regulations for trade and the international financial systems. The responsibilities are huge, the challenges many, and the task arduous, but, now more than ever, the European Union must step up to the plate and lead these reforms. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I will use the brief time I have available to express my group’s support for the report by Mr Ferreira. In our opinion, it has at least two advantages. Firstly, it focuses on a vital fishing sector that is often overlooked and sacrificed: small-scale, artisanal and coastal fishing, which is the sector in which most European vessels and fishermen operate. Secondly, this report puts the problem of small-scale fishing at the heart of the reform of the common fisheries policy. If, as we hope, the new fisheries policy is based on sustainable fishing criteria, the interests of artisanal fishermen will be guaranteed and consolidated. We will only be able to ensure the future of thousands of small-scale fishermen, and with them the global food supply to which they make a vital contribution, if we have a fisheries policy that is firmly focused on conserving marine resources, and protecting and renewing stocks. Jean-Paul Besset,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I have to say that I am fairly satisfied with Mrs Damanaki’s response on this issue of the consequences of rising oil prices for fishermen. This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity – and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay. We therefore cannot provide a short-term, circumstantial solution by increasing subsidies in line with the fluctuations in oil prices. This is a question of political logic. The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy. Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools. Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, on behalf of my three fellow Members, Mrs Pietikäinen, Mrs Sârbu and Mr Davies, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 410 Members of the European Parliament who signed Written Declaration 71/2010 on support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning, which we tabled. Indeed, this fragile species, like many others, is subjected to a veritable massacring at sea as a result of finning practices and the discarding of carcasses at sea following that mutilation. Thank you for having overwhelmingly signed this Written Declaration. It sends a strong signal to the Commission to bring about the strengthening of regulations to protect this species.

Mr President, I should like to focus my speech on Mr Luhan’s report. Regional cohesion policies have a key role to play in Europe for economic development that is balanced, socially harmonious and ecologically effective, that is, at the end of the day, globally competitive. I thank Mr Luhan for including some of our amendments aimed at establishing a sustainable low carbon economy which safeguards biodiversity. Nonetheless, we cannot vote for his resolution because it promotes a vision of cohesion policy as an instrument for global competitiveness that still appears to us to be too narrow, too restricted and inadequate. We must point out two sticking points. Firstly, the rapporteur relies almost exclusively on quantitative measures in terms of infrastructure as the driving force for growth, increase being his main criterion. We do not feel that is appropriate for the current situation. For example, he mentions 246 operational programmes in research and development and is proud of these, but without questioning what they are about. Research is a good thing but we also need to know what it is that we are researching. The second sticking point is that the rapporteur does not put forward sufficiently clear plans. We would have liked a robust choice in order to meet the challenges set out in his report, the choice of a green economy, of a green new deal which is the only choice capable of moving Europe and its regions upwards. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to an aspect of this resolution, which is of central and not secondary importance to me, and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning. The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds. It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this ‘targeted approach to territorial development’, to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach. What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies? Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth. However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product. People’s well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve. If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view. To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions – which, I would point out, is our shared objective – the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres. It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment.

 Mr President, the rather forbidding title of Mr Sterckx’s report introduces a very important issue, which goes far beyond the administrative and technical matters that the title implies. It deals with an important political decision, namely, making the maritime transport sector more attractive, more efficient and more competitive. In our view, this is the sector of the future and provides the best means of transport from an environmental point of view. Mr Sterckx’s excellent report and the contributions of all the shadow rapporteurs will allow us to make significant progress in this field. From our point of view, this directive hits the mark: it will increase the level of harmonisation within the maritime transport sector, making it better coordinated and simplified. We will therefore wholeheartedly support this report when we vote on the matter, even though we would have liked to see it implemented faster and to see more strength of resolve with regard to the introduction of a common language in that sector. However, we think that the compromises achieved with the Council are still acceptable. We therefore unreservedly support this report. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, I agree with the content and conclusions in the report by my colleague and friend Mr Romeva i Rueda, and I welcome the collective work that has been done on this report. The report is based on a reality that is now unavoidable. Bluefin tuna is under threat of extinction as a species, and many fishermen, an important economic sector and a vital food resource for mankind are at risk along with it. I would like to emphasise what this situation will really mean and the shock it will cause in relation to the period in which we currently live. For it is indeed a shock. For the first time, there is a clear threat to a major consumer product that is known to all, available on supermarket shelves and consumed by us all. It is a clear signal: the sign of a change of era. Protecting bluefin tuna is now a major early warning sign from the environment, and the significance of that warning goes far beyond the single issue of bluefin tuna. The threat to fish stocks and their much-needed protection are now the symbol of humanity’s entry into a new era of scarce resources: fish resources, food resources and energy resources. The key words should no longer be waste, overproduction and overconsumption, but saving, sharing and caution. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports Mr van Dalen’s report and recommendations. He offers us a balanced text which is the result of the close collaboration he managed to establish with the other political groups. We endorse this report because it clearly sets out the challenges facing the EU’s maritime policy, namely a significant increase in maritime traffic, both inside and outside the Union, without sacrificing the environment or social issues. This text is consistent with a rationale that we wish to see applied in all areas: a policy of sustainable development. It offers positive paths to allow maritime transport to develop between now and 2018 in the best possible conditions. In particular, we highlight the fight against abuses of flags of convenience or substandard vessels. We also highlight protection against piracy. We highlight having a policy designed within the framework of a single European sea, and the importance ascribed to the multimodal linking of European sea ports with the hinterland. We highlight the support for simplification of the administrative rules governing entry and exit from European ports. We highlight the promotion of maritime occupations and continuous training for them. Lastly, we highlight the priority given to environmental issues. On the whole, we will always support anything which, in our view, helps to promote a maritime transport sector which can compete with road and air transport. Mr van Dalen’s report has taken full stock of the global environmental challenge, for which maritime transport is one of the solutions. In particular, it is a useful tool against global warming. Our only regret is that the amendment that we tabled in order to integrate the maritime transport sector into the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system has not been taken up by the rapporteur or by the Commission. From our point of view, no economic sector should depart from the general rule, and, as with the air and road sectors, maritime transport, even if it is only responsible for low gas emissions, must do its part to reduce them. We will therefore be retabling our amendment to plenary. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, nobody has mentioned this yet, but something important happened on Sunday when the World Bank published its report and announced that the Earth will be more than four degrees warmer by 2060. Given that it is the World Bank saying this, I think it is safe to say that the situation is very serious. It means in practical terms that if we want to prevent this from occurring, we need to go from 35 billion cubic metres of CO2
 in 2050 to 10 billion. This requires very strict measures, not simply just to lower our emissions but to actually reduce them by a third or a half. This means that when we are dealing with this European and global issue today, we cannot simply chase after easily available energy sources if we want to avoid the effects of global warming. I say this because today everybody knows that methane has an effect on global warming 30 times greater than that of CO2
, and between 4 to 8 % of methane escapes between the wells and the pipes when extracting shale gas. This applies to all forms of methane, obviously. It is therefore a key issue. Finally, to give an example showing the need for European regulation, I went to visit a shale gas well near Wrocław in Poland operated by Halliburton. There was nothing to capture the water. Fracking had occurred and the water had just been released into the environment. That is why we need proper legislation and a moratorium while it goes through. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we are currently experiencing a situation where production is increasing by more than 2.5%. At the same time, industrialists are lowering their prices. In Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and throughout European countries, prices are falling. This clearly means that prices are linked to production volumes and that we must organise production volumes as well as prices. At the same time, today, producers are falling victim to an increase of more than 44% in the price of vegetable proteins and 30% in the price of cereals. Parliament has already voted on the need to ensure that added value is distributed among producers and that farmers do not become the victims of companies and large-scale distribution. I would therefore ask the Commission today, but also the Council, to once again call into question controls on production, but at the same time, and I say this very clearly, Member States must get their own house in order because there are countries which have respected the quota rules and others which have not. This is another reason why these quotas have been called into question. There is therefore a double responsibility on the part of the Commission and the Member States. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Blue-card question.

Mr President, Mr Deß, I understand what you are saying and I am entirely in agreement with you. I have a very specific question on this subject. In the documents that I have managed to collect, I see that in Germany, while there are normally price negotiations between milk producers and buyers, industrialists, cooperatives and so on, Aldi – which is today a large-scale distribution group – has unilaterally decided to lower the price of a litre of milk by six cents. At the same time, all the other ‘hard discounters’ have just done the same thing. How do you explain the fact that, in Germany, large-scale distributors can set prices while, normally, according to the mechanisms put in place by the European Union, there ought to be discussions between industrialists and producers? We can clearly see that today there is a problem in the rules for setting milk prices. How do you explain this? José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I should like to speak about the issue of granting discharge to agencies and specifically, the European Food Safety Authority. More than two years ago, I questioned Mr Dali about a possible conflict of interest concerning the President of that agency, Ms Bánáti. It turned out that I was correct: yesterday, Ms Bánáti was forced to resign on the eve of the forthcoming vote. Since she resigned, she has been recruited as director of the largest international agri-food lobby, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which brings together all the companies in the sector. We now have a genuine problem. Everyone is aware of that, including the director of that agency herself. We need to take a close look at the issue of conflicts of interest and the transparency of assessments. The same goes for medicines. Today, I am asking to postpone the vote on the discharge, not for financial reasons, but, very specifically, to ask the Commission to introduce clear rules in favour of transparency and against conflicts of interest.

Blue-card answer.
 – (FR)
 I think that this is a positive move, but it is not enough. We need clear rules. We do not, however, have clear rules on conflicts of interest at the moment, not only for the appointment of management boards, but also for the appointment of experts. That is why I think that we have to take our time. If we refuse to grant this discharge, we shall have an historic opportunity to create transparency so that there can be no ambiguity about these agencies. I am in favour of the agencies and their development, and also of an increase in their state funding to avoid conflicts of interest with the private sector. I am campaigning today to strengthen the agencies, but that can only be done by combating conflicts of interest and ensuring transparency. José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, let me make a statement of fact: our citizens increasingly want to find and consume locally produced and seasonal food, for health and quality reasons in particular. We have to find ways to enable farmers to meet this growing demand effectively and quickly. We have to support the establishment of local infrastructure for producers, such as maintaining local abattoirs which, while guaranteeing rigorous sanitary control, facilitate the development of local short food supply chains and strengthen direct selling. Support for local agriculture and direct selling should help producers sell their products and bring them to the attention of consumers. Stronger direct relations will enable farmers to retain more of the added-value created on their farms. Direct selling within the farm must be promoted and facilitated and support must be given to the collective actions of farmers who want to open collective points of sale enabling them to offer local consumers a wider range of products. The Commission must facilitate the emergence, sustainability and development of systems of selling through direct delivery to consumers, such as the Associations for the Preservation of Smallholdings (AMAP) in France, which enable approximately 3 000 farmers to supply 60 000 families. Finally, Member States must be able to add other criteria concerning, in particular, the size of the farm, the volume of production or the traditional character of the product in order to define local agriculture.

 Mr President, Commissioner, there are some saying today that this project has nothing to do with the common agricultural policy. I tell you this is not the case. What is now very clear is that the objective of the common agricultural policy was to ensure food security, to make sure that products are affordable for all consumers, ensuring farmers’ income. Feeding all the citizens of Europe is therefore part of the fundamental charter of the first integrated European policy. When we can now transfer money from the CAP balance to fund the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) to the tune of almost EUR 500 million, how is it that, in some States, some are questioning the EUR 500 million to help the poor? We have now reached an agreement until 2014. I think that after this, there will need to be a link between the CAP and welfare systems to ensure that the poorest have access to this food. We are committed to this and I hope that in terms of agricultural policy, special efforts will be made so that the poorest can also directly access production. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Nicholson on the courage he displayed when facing the Council and the Commission. Nevertheless, I fear that the end result does not strike a balance between producers and manufacturers. This agreement reminds me of the children’s tale about a paradise where vegetarian lions would lie down with lambs and eat grass. I do not believe it for a second! From 2003 Ms Fischer Boel did everything in her power to destroy the milk quotas from an ideological perspective. In October 2009, despite these efforts, the Court of Auditors recognised the effectiveness of the milk quotas. Today, however, we find ourselves in a situation that is going to be even worse and we can see what is already happening in Denmark, where the most solid farms, with rising production, are all going bankrupt, with a 40% reduction in land prices. Do we want to see the same thing right across Europe? Surely not! We need to control production with the participation of the public authorities. José Bové,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU–Morocco agreement encourages both sides of the Mediterranean to concentrate on capital-intensive corporate farms at the expense of family and peasant farming. The rise in the number of quotas at reduced rates for a wide range of fruit and vegetables makes it difficult for EU producers to continue to compete, but at the same time does not help the development of balanced agriculture in Morocco. Labour costs are the principal factor determining the price of fruit and vegetables. Morocco has an undeniable advantage today due to the widespread use of child labour and the ban on agricultural workers forming trade unions. Workers in Morocco earn around EUR 5 per day, compared with EUR 50 in Spain. How can we cope with this type of competition and this social dumping? Respect for trade union rights and a ban on child labour are essential preconditions for ratification of a new trade agreement with Morocco. The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is a cause for concern among EU producer organisations. The problems with the system allow operators to reduce the import duties they pay. The European Commission has never equipped itself with the means to combat this type of fraud and it needs to resolve this issue before proposing a new agreement. In Morocco the way in which export quotas are managed favours large groups. In the tomato sector 70% of Moroccan exports come from just three groups. Moroccan family-run farms do not benefit from this agreement. According to a study funded by the European Union, the Abu Dhabi Tiris Euro Arab investment fund obtained 700 000 hectares in the south of Morocco to plant and harvest citrus fruits, olives and market-garden crops. The monopolising of land, which is so shocking to our fellow citizens, is also happening on a large scale in Morocco. In the Souss region, where tomato growing is concentrated, the water table is falling by two metres per year. In Western Sahara agri-businesses are drawing on coastal ground water. This irrigation results in the salinisation of fresh water, jeopardising the local population’s drinking water supply. Exporting 350 000 tonnes of tomatoes is equivalent to exporting 35 million cubic metres of water from Morocco to Europe. The social, environmental and economic effects have not been assessed by the Commission. We are still waiting for the impact study. A study is required to allow Parliament to reach a decision in full knowledge of the facts. We have never allowed an agreement to be adopted before identifying its social, economic and environmental repercussions. I have raised the question of the territorial scope of the EU–Morocco agreement. A number of countries, including the United States, have signed free trade agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco that expressly excluded Western Sahara. This was done so as not to influence the outcome of international negotiations being held under the aegis of the United Nations to enable the various parties to find a peaceful settlement. As the Commission and Parliament’s Legal Service hold diverging views on this issue, we cannot guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that this free trade agreement will comply with the international treaties that are binding on the European Union and all of its Member States. Consequently, the European Parliament should reject the agreement. That will enable us to reopen the negotiations on a new footing. I think that it will also send a strong message to the Commission to change its working method by allowing the European Parliament to participate from the initial stages of the discussions among the parties. The European Commission must produce concrete, serious impact studies on the economic, social, environmental and budgetary effects of the agreements it is negotiating. We can no longer accept the fact that Parliament only has the option of saying yes or no. I must inform you that, contrary to the opinion adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which opposes the agreement, the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade is to approve the agreement between the European Union and Morocco. I am bound to state that publicly. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the arguments that I have just set out, you will no doubt realise that I am asking you very clearly to vote against the conclusion of this agreement. This is not just in the interests of European farmers, who are unanimously opposed to the agreement right across the trade union spectrum, but also, and above all, it is in the interests of Moroccan farmers, who are today being deprived of their land by large exporter groups and who, because of this unbalanced agreement, are going to have their meat, dairy and cereal production capacity destroyed by imports by large European groups. I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject this agreement, which is a bad agreement. By rejecting it, we will reopen the debate but we will not prevent the previous agreement from continuing. It is thus simply the extension of the agreement that I am asking you to reject, in the interests of farmers on both sides of the Mediterranean. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, we have just had a debate that, in spite of everything, was interesting because for the first time it was a real debate on a free trade agreement. Some people referred to the facts, others to ideology, even belief, belief in free trade as a stepping stone to democracy. I hope that those people do not find themselves one day in a situation where they have to face the people who have suffered because of free trade agreements, of any kind: today the peasant farmers who produce fruit and vegetables, or tomorrow the meat producers when it is time for the Mercosur agreement. I believe that this free trade agreement is a bad agreement, especially for Morocco’s peasant farmers. If the ‘yes’ vote prevails on Thursday – which is of course possible as I do not know what will happen – it will mean that you are creating all of the conditions for the Arab Spring to arrive finally in Morocco. That means that you will be in a bit of a strange situation tomorrow. In fact, the agreement provides for an increase of more than 50% for European products on Moroccan territory, compared with just 15% for Moroccan products in Europe, which means that hundreds of thousands of Moroccan families are going to be thrown out on the street because of these exports to their country. Is that what you want? I get the impression today that you are not talking about the reality. You refuse to talk about the reality. We are accepting this agreement because Morocco is promising to protect us from the immigration from Africa. That is what is happening and it also features in all of your texts. Are we concluding economic agreements solely to build a wall on the other side of the Mediterranean to protect Europe? We have to get serious! We have to get back to the actual facts, and the actual facts all come down to agriculture. However, this agreement is a bad plan for agriculture. A 1% increase in volume over what is offered could lead to prices collapsing. As you are all too aware, Commissioner, the balance between supply and demand is very fragile. A 1% adjustment can make prices collapse and have devastating consequences. We know that Perpignan is currently a key transit point for tomatoes. We know that the head offices of the two largest firms, Azura and Idyl, are located in France. We know that today. So why are we continuing in this manner? We also know that the Commission has internal EU documents that show that more than 700 000 hectares were given to the Persian Gulf fund. You cannot deny that today; it is the Commission’s own documents that prove it. We need to get serious when it comes to the issue of water, too. We are told today that there is no information about water, even though European universities, in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, in addition to Moroccan universities are providing figures. I do not need to say any more. As regards our obligation to Western Sahara, I did not want to turn it into a political battle, but simply to raise a point of law. Indeed, the law is clear-cut. If Western Sahara is not excluded from this agreement tomorrow, you could face the possibility of action before the European Court of Justice. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2010, Parliament adopted the report by the Committee on Agriculture aimed at ensuring fair revenues for farmers. In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other. The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work. On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation. The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources. European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products. We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production. In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions. Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances. However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc. The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves. Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP. The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm. Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource. This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing. Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers! José Bové,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important. The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain. Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial. Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense. José Bové,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, now that this text has been adopted, I think that it is important to point out that a collective effort was made on the part of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and that, thanks to this collective effort, we shall be able to step up the pressure on the Commission and the Council to ensure that, finally, farmers in Europe are taken into consideration, both in terms of their costs and their income. I should therefore like to thank this Assembly for that and to thank my fellow Members who helped me draw up this report, in particular, Mr Lorensen. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not want to repeat what everyone has already said, but I believe that, today, Europe does in fact have a real problem of credibility as a result of what is happening. We are being put on trial. We are being told, on the one hand, that there is the European policy and, on the other, that there is the policy of the Member States. However, if the Treaty of Rome of 1958 tells us that we must ensure that all Europeans are fed and that we must guarantee food security, this is a European policy. It is not a policy of the Member States Today, this situation shows, in addition to the selfishness of a number of Member States, that what is lacking is not more Europe but rather a European will on the part of a number of Heads of State or Government. At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the European Commissioner, Mr Cioloş, who, in an opinion piece published in the Le Monde
 newspaper, had the courage to say that this policy was essential for the poorest Europeans. If we are incapable of challenging the decision of the Council, Europe will be disowned by its citizens. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I wanted to speak as we met in your country, in Warsaw, with the delegation from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, when we decided to speak on a number of very specific issues. It was pointed out, with regard to climate, that the Polish Presidency was somewhat cautious and did not want to make this issue a priority, as the Durban climate change conference is taking place at the end of the year. The European Parliament has very clearly stated the need to reduce CO2
 emissions by 25% or even by 30%. Yet, when it comes to environmental safety, I unfortunately do not sense the same will from you as you asserted this morning – which I was pleased to hear – regarding energy security and food security. Environmental security seems to be just as fundamental to me and we will not have one without the other. I think this is a central point. On food security, I would like your Presidency to be more active. Yesterday, the European Parliament said very clearly that countries should have the right to opt out of cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately, while we were voting on that, you changed the law in Poland on 1 July to allow GMOs in, under pressure from Mr Barroso. I would like you to enable this procedure in order to ensure that countries have the right to resist, as you have done for many years. Another point, now, at the end of the year … (The President interrupted the speaker)
 … the meeting of energy ministers is going to take place; I would like you to take into account the requirement to have a policy for a moratorium on shale gas. (Applause) José Bové  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lepage, I think that the rapporteur has tried to do the best she could do in a bad situation. The European Commissioner has presented a proposal for renationalisation, which has been a total failure from a legal point of view, because, as we have seen, the legal services of Parliament and of the Council said that this solution was contrary to competition law and would pose major problems at an international level. So proposing to Member States now that this debate can be taken up again without a clear legal basis will create more problems than it will solve. I will be brief. Commissioner, what I want to hear from you today is a very clear statement on whether you will commit yourself to integrating into European legislation the rules that will be adopted by Parliament in the context of the revision of the directive on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). José Bové  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do agree that, as well as liberty and fraternity, there should be equality for farmers and the new Member States in Eastern Europe. Yes, I agree with you. I think that this report marks a huge step forward. It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational. However, the important thing is that we reached a consensus. This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision, and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament’s great strength. We have succeeded, despite the difficulties, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and all the Members. The first phase is complete. In this document, we have reiterated the need for equality, justice and fairness for producers and regions. I think that is important. We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms, that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity. In my opinion, this was another fundamental point. The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts. We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations. This is not a question of ideology. Lastly, at present, we are worried about the real budgetary threats. We need to come up with unequivocal responses. What we want now is to move into the second phase, which is obviously the legislative debate. Why? Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going. That is essentially what we are waiting for. Let me close, however, by expressing my fury at Germany’s attitude. It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe’s poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount. That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget. I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat. José Bové,

 Madam President, Commissioner, as in 2008, the price of agricultural raw materials is soaring on world markets. We are only at 3% of the 2008 level. The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission. The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day. Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line. Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States? Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets. This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators. The impact is also dramatic for European farmers. They are no longer able to feed their animals. Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300. This is a whole new ball game. The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well, today, to follow its own advice. Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions. The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions. Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price. Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices. Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, a year ago, you told me that GMOs had polluted your first term of office and that you wanted to refer the issue back to the Member States. A few days ago, 1 200 000 signatures were collected from European citizens asking for an independent expert report on GMOs. A few days ago again, the Environment Council rejected Commissioner Dalli’s proposal by a very large majority. The opinions of both Council’s and Parliament’s legal advisers have also been negative. Lastly, you have witnessed the scandal at EFSA with the Banati affair and the questions raised by the panel. What is more, EFSA itself has decided to issue new assessment guidelines. What I would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations, such as that of MON810, until the new EFSA rules have come into force? New assessments and authorisation renewals should be processed according to the new rules. Finally, are you willing to relaunch the debate so that we can get an independent assessment? José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Thank you for your answer. However, EFSA has already put in place new guidelines that are much stricter. Are you willing to agree that all new authorisations that have been granted over this latest period and the issue of MON810 should be reviewed in the light of these new guidelines? We cannot accept assessments today that were carried out on the basis of old rules. That is why I am asking you this question very precisely and I would like you to start this whole debate again from scratch, instead of waiting until 2012. Directive 2001/18/EC is due to be updated in 2012: the process needs to be brought forward. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago. Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month. Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe’s small-scale agriculture before we act? Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo – is that right? On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers. It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price. The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers’ organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors. Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility. Next week, Commissioner Cioloş will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers. Europe’s credibility is at stake. Europe needs every single one of its farmers. José Bové,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for their support in this task. This report, like the one by Mr Lyon, is part of our major debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We have managed to reach a large number of compromises, which have been adopted by a large majority in our group – by 32 votes to 4. I believe that our message to the Commission is a powerful one: we all want greater transparency in the food chain and legislation that guarantees fair competition between farmers and all operators in the food chain. We also want concrete measures, in Europe and elsewhere, to combat speculation and abuses of market power and to safeguard farmers’ revenues. I am surprised that, on the initiative of one or two political groups in this House, we are being asked to vote tomorrow on a long list of separate votes, which go against the powerful and consensual message that we adopted by a large majority in committee. Could it be that events over the summer have made you change your minds? I rather think that the intense lobbying carried out in recent days by the large-scale distribution sector and certain operators in the agri-food industry is the reason for the excessive number of separate votes. In any case, I cannot imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that you would give in to such pressure in order to weaken our common message. Our committee has taken stock of the crisis affecting European farmers. It intends to propose concrete, strong measures: in less than 10 years, the Union has lost 3.5 million farming jobs. It is a massacre on a terrible scale. Bulgaria, for example, has lost one in two farmers. In 2009, revenues plummeted. In France and Germany, farmers have lost 20% of their revenue on average, and in Hungary, they have lost more than 35%. Farming and rural communities are in danger of disappearing. Forced as it was by the exasperation of farmers and by the demonstrations of dairy cattle breeders, in December 2009, the European Commission published a communication entitled, ‘A better functioning food supply chain in Europe’. The latter shows that, between 1995 and 2005, the proportion of the added value of the food chain that went to agricultural producers decreased from 31% to 24%. The prices paid to farmers are falling in virtually every sector, without European consumers benefiting as a result. The Commission says that these problems are linked to increased concentration in the wholesale, processing and distribution sectors, which impose their will on unorganised producers. The Commission is concerned about the lack of transparency in relation to pricing and margins. It recognises the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data, and admits that it does not have the information it needs to adapt its policies quickly and effectively. To remedy this, I propose that the Commission creates a European farm prices and margins observatory, on the model of that which exists in the United States. This body will be responsible for defining European farmers’ production costs. It will tell us the real costs of a litre of milk, a kilo of wheat or a kilo of beef from the moment it leaves the farm. This information will serve as a basis for negotiations between farmers and the other operators in the food chain. This body will also be responsible for assessing which sectors claim all the added value, to the detriment of producers and consumers. The European Commission would thus be able to identify which operators are abusing the balance of power and abusing their dominant position. It also seems crucial to make the 20 largest European companies draft an annual report on their market share and the internal margins they generate. Transparency poses no threat to the market economy. On the contrary, it is an absolute necessity in order to prevent the abuses that have been observed in agriculture and in many other sectors, in particular, that of finance. Who can claim that, when farmers sell their milk or their meat, they are on an equal footing with multinationals, which influence commodity price building on the global markets? The balance of power is completely unbalanced, and some would say unfair. In order to restore the balance, a first emergency measure would be to allow farmers to come together within producers’ organisations. The second, additional measure involves prohibiting selling of goods below purchase price at Community level. Forced discounts, subsequent alterations to contract terms, and unjustified listing fees are a common occurrence. They are hitting farmers and the thousands of small and medium-sized processing companies hard, because they have to go through the large-scale distribution sector in order to sell their products. The European Commission must take stock of the extent of these anti-economic practices, and it must take the measures required to stop them. Lastly, speculation on agricultural commodities is a scourge. Financiers and speculators are looking for instant rewards and instant profits. For them, poverty, hunger and famine are synonymous with profits. We did not think that we would relive the 2008 riots, but we could not have been more mistaken. Since June, the price of wheat has risen by more than 70%. The prices of maize, soya and rice are also on the increase. Last week, seven people were killed in Maputo, Mozambique, for demonstrating against the 30% increase in food prices. Are we going to continue to stand by and do nothing, as we did two years ago? Are we going to continue to put up with investment banks bankrupting European farmers and crushing the men and women of our planet? I call on the European Union to take the initiative to create a global agency to regulate the markets. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to send out a strong message so that the new CAP is fairer for European farmers and consumers and so that there is fair competition between operators which allows for the creation of a framework for regulating the markets and which gives short shrift to speculators. It is the responsibility of the European Parliament, as it prepares to exercise its joint decision-making power in agricultural matters, not to submit to any pressure, from wherever it may come. Our message must remain clear and consistent. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I am pleased with the debate that we have just had, in which a very large number of Members were able to speak. It is true that, at this time, on the first day of the part-session, there are rather too many of us for this debate, which shows just how interested all of the groups are in the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The important thing for me is that the report that we have debated, the text that is going to be voted on tomorrow in this House, is a joint text. This has been mentioned by a number of speakers. I am the rapporteur, but this text has been drafted jointly within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I think that that is very important. Everyone came with his or her own idea or story, and we came up with this proposal together. I feel it is important to emphasise this. It is my name that appears on this report, but it is a joint report, and I wanted to reiterate that. Several speakers stressed the need to safeguard farmers’ incomes through the sale of their agricultural products. That is the very foundation of agriculture. Farmers are paid from the sale of their products, and so to say that, today, farmers cannot sell below production cost is an essential, indispensable condition if we are to continue to have farmers in Europe in the future. Agricultural policy makes it possible to support, to maintain agricultural activity across regions, and to combat distortions linked to natural handicaps or to the regions. Therefore, the fact is that there will be no common agricultural policy if farmers cannot earn a living from their production in the first place. Farmers are the ones making the strongest calls in this regard, and Parliament has just successfully repeated their demands. The second point that I feel emerged clearly from our debate just now is the need for transparency all along the food chain. All the speakers came back to this point at various levels, in particular, with regard to the processing sector in negotiations with producers, or with the large-scale distribution sector, which, often, for example in the case of fruit and vegetables, creams off unbelievable profits. Today, all that is acknowledged; this need is no longer in doubt. Many speakers also focused on the issue of speculation; I am not going to go back over it. Therefore, I would say that, once the vote has been held tomorrow in plenary – and I believe that all the speeches have demonstrated the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s collective will to table this report and to convince all of our fellow Members – once the text is adopted, once it is voted for tomorrow, the ball will be in the Commission’s court. Moreover, I should like to say to the Commissioner: it is now up to you to take action. This is an initiative that we are taking. We are making proposals to you. Our expectation, of course, is that this work will now be taken up by the Commission and the Council, since it is clear that Parliament alone will be unable to do anything. On the other hand, by working together, we will be able to build a new common agricultural policy. Above all, however, we will be able to give hope to European farmers. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, first of all I would obviously like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lyon, with whom I believe we all worked on the basis of mutual agreement to try to move forward, and I would like to say briefly, in just a few words, that the evidence is there for us to see. The evidence is that, today, Europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials. We must have an ambitious agricultural and food policy so that we can ensure that our citizens’ food needs are met. Furthermore, today we have a CAP that must be reformed for three reasons. It is a CAP that is unfair, economically, socially and environmentally. Economically: the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must allow for this problem to be resolved. Socially: aid is unfairly distributed between countries, regions and farmers. Eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20% of farmers. Environmentally: we need a CAP which respects the soil, which respects … (The President cut off the speaker) José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, reopening negotiations with Mercosur when the European Union is getting ready to redefine its agricultural policy reveals a dangerous lack of consistency on the part of the Commission. Europe already imports 500 000 tonnes of beef. Opening up our market even further would be to the disadvantage of the cattle breeders of Europe’s less-favoured areas, without any guarantee of respect for health and social standards. We cannot accept this. Europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle. These imports from Brazil and Argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares. They are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises: Cargill, ADM and Bunch. Between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1.2 million hectares of tropical and equatorial forest. It is one of the principal causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity. The European Parliament has decided to produce a report on the recovery of autonomy in respect of vegetable proteins for livestock feed. This decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change. These efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement. Once again the European Commission is selling short its farming and its farmers in order to obtain chance gains for service companies. These concessions will not serve the interests of the farming families of Mercosur, only those of agro-industrial groups. Convincing evidence of this can be found in the report by the Tyson group, a US corporation and heavyweight in the international meat market, which announced that it has invested in Brazil – I quote, and it is in its report – to use this country as a platform for exporting to Europe. Other enterprises, such as the Doux Group, had already anticipated this move by buying out the Brazilian Frangosul Group in 1998. Many poultry farmers, particularly in Brittany, paid the price for that deal. Europe seems to want to pursue its policy of relocation by intensifying its attacks against farmers. We must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality, locally produced food. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against hunger demands a substantial political and financial investment. The Food and Agricultural Organisation was unable to generate that investment last week in Rome, and I regret that. More than a billion people suffer from malnutrition and 40 million men, women and children die of hunger each year. These dramatic figures have risen since 1996, the year of the first World Food Summit. The global financial and economic crisis has aggravated the situation, and the populations of the countries of the South are the main victims. Ten per cent of the advertising budget worldwide would allow developing countries to be given the necessary support to safeguard their agricultural infrastructure. The food crisis is one of the main threats hanging over peace and stability in the world. In 2050, small farmers will have to feed more than 9 billion people. Soil damage, damage to biodiversity, oil dependency, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and the development of consumption patterns put us in a very fragile situation, more fragile than 40 years ago. Poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity. The need to support local production is obvious. At the end of the 1950s, Europe introduced the common agricultural policy in order to produce the food it needed. To do this it protected its internal market and supported its consumers. This autonomous choice, this right to food sovereignty, must now be accessible to all the countries or groups of countries throughout the world that want it. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, please excuse me, I was supposed to come earlier, but I was tied up. I was explaining to French listeners what took place yesterday in Luxembourg. I believe that the Council’s decision is a bad one, since the only word to appear in the text is ‘restructuring’. In France, we have gone from having 480 000 milk producers in 1984 to having fewer than 88 000 today. Today, we are told that yet more producers must be forced out and that the money that will be recouped – this appears in the text – will be used for producers who have exceeded their quota. Production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out. This is the wrong approach. The money that has been given, the EUR 280 million – the figure has already been quoted – equates to EUR 50 per month and per farm, for one year. That is peanuts; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through. Lastly, on the subject of Article 186, I should like to say that, at a time when we are moving towards codecision in agricultural matters, it is unacceptable for power, for a blank cheque, to be handed back to the Commission. José Bové,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for months now livestock farmers have been warning the Commission and the Council of the gravity of the crisis. Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas. The European Union had counted on growth in world demand. Its experts got it very wrong. The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption. The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council’s wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers. Times have changed. European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment. The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs. On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents. At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money. Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives. In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly. We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers. The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry. It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs. The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme. It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets. It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate. Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand. A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable. It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns. Without the small farmers, there will be no Europe. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, we are all saying the same thing: the employment situation in Europe is catastrophic. With one quarter of young people under 25 unemployed, there is a lot at stake for the new generation, which refuses to be a lost generation. The Commission has opened up the way with its employment package, which is designed to create 17 million jobs by 2020. However, it continues to lead us towards disaster by driving through austerity plans which increase unemployment and condemn the most vulnerable to the worst kind of hardships. Yet, an exit from the crisis is simple. We must transform our economy ecologically and socially. To that end, we need to develop green, sustainable and non-outsourceable jobs through targeted investments in green, innovative industries. We need to invest in life-long training and in promoting the social and solidarity economy. In addition, it is necessary to promote decent work, taking into account the objectives of the International Labour Organisation of improving rights and working conditions, and to reaffirm the vital need to increase the minimum wage so as to put an end to the scandal of poor workers and to fight social dumping. We have the means to end the scourge of unemployment. Yes, it is possible! What, then, is lacking? All that is lacking is the political will. That is your responsibility! Mr Barroso accorded high priority to the issue of youth and youth unemployment in particular. What is the youth unemployment situation now, three years later? There are no specific proposals. There is nothing. Action needs to be taken and it needs to be taken now. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, in its proposal for a regulation covering all the Structural Funds, the Commission has earmarked a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a future food aid scheme for the most needy for 2014-2020, despite fierce opposition from a minority of Member States within the Council. This is a brave decision by the Commission and one which is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, but, more importantly, with those of most of our fellow citizens. This is at a time when, with the worsening of the social crisis, increasing numbers throughout Europe are calling upon help from food banks. It is a brave decision, but it is not enough. At present, the food aid programme for the most deprived is worth EUR 500 million per year. By proposing a budget of EUR 2.5 billion over seven years, the Commission has consciously reduced this budget by EUR 1 billion, even though the demand is continuously increasing. In addition, we know nothing of the Commission’s intentions in terms of how the future programme will be introduced. If the funds are allocated within the framework of the European Social Fund, it will be difficult to continue buying food on the agricultural markets to distribute it to the most deprived because of the way in which the social fund is managed, especially since this practice has been condemned by the European Court of Justice. However, if no solution is found, the food banks will find themselves in a situation that they have managed to avoid until now. What do you actually intend to do? I, for one, believe it is necessary to maintain a decent budget for this programme and to ensure that each and every one of us, especially the most deprived, has the right to healthy food at an affordable price. Lastly, I believe an effective safety net is needed, as is a strong framework directive on a minimum income. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Commissioner, more than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. It is therefore with a certain amount of relief that we welcome the new extension of the European food aid programme until 2014. The poorest will continue to receive the essential charitable support that they need at a time when the demands faced by these charities are growing. Yet the real question is what next. What will happen after 2014? Is it not just lip service the promise to reduce poverty by a quarter in the EU by 2020? We must give ourselves the means to achieve this goal. That is why we will ensure that the new financial framework preserves this programme as part of the cohesion policy to ensure that those Member States in need do actually benefit from this aid. However, there is one condition: this transfer to the ESF should also be allocated a large enough budget to ensure that no-one is left by the wayside. What is at stake here is the matter of solidarity between the European people. One final point, Commissioner, the poorest are also entitled to a healthy and balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. Karima Delli,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, I am angry. Here we are two years after the consensus conference rightly piloted a European strategy for the homeless under the Belgian Presidency. The European Parliament drafted a written declaration in favour of the homeless. No response. I drafted the resolution in favour of a European strategy for the homeless. The Commission did not respond to our request, which remains a dead letter. I am sorry that today there is no one on the Council’s bench, while it is the Member States’ responsibility to ensure the right to housing assistance for all those who do not have sufficient resources. In two weeks, the spell of very cold weather has killed over 600 people; this has already been said. I say it time and again: the homeless do not only die in winter. All year round they sleep on the streets and all year round they have their rights trampled on. European citizens expect more from the European Union today. It must be united and active faced with the distress of the most vulnerable people. The situation is more than worrying. I will give you a few examples. In Greece, the number of homeless people has increased by 25% in two years. In Hungary, the homeless are persecuted by the police and threatened with heavy fines. In France, we are seeing decrees which criminalise begging and stealing food from bins. Where is this headed? We are seeing it more and more: austerity policies led by the governments will have disastrous consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, let us demand a shake-up, a wake-up call. We can change things. I will say it very clearly, Commissioner; the European Union must play its part for solidarity between the Member States and the European people. We must urgently bring together the ministers concerned. The time for saving the banks is over. It is now time to save lives. We have already waited too long. Each Member State must make the Commission aware of the measures it has put in place since the cold spell began. We must mobilise an emergency fund immediately to come to the aid of the most vulnerable people. The Member States which do not respect their obligation to provide emergency assistance to the most impoverished must be sanctioned, particularly those which criminalise the homeless or prohibit access to emergency shelters for certain groups of people. Finally, Mr Barnier, the Commission must put in place a European strategy for the homeless immediately. The aim is clear; we have discussed it here; ladies and gentlemen, no one should be sleeping on the streets by 2015. This is an emergency. In order to dream, you must have somewhere to sleep. If we let it, this glacial silence from European representatives will lead to distrust among the citizens. You really need to react … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) needs this debate. This instrument has a positive role but, first of all, the procedures are too long to provide effective protection for workers who need support quickly so that they are not left to their own devices. Secondly, the brief history of this EGF has already been plagued by very controversial cases of payments from public authorities which served only to repair the damage caused by companies savagely outsourcing. The European Union would do better than to beat its head against a brick wall. It needs, first of all, to think about how it authorises free trade which is both lawless and unscrupulous. When will social and environmental criteria be integrated in our commercial agreements to combat dumping? The famous EGF must be a tool supporting the immediate transition to high quality ‘green’ jobs, hence local jobs that cannot be outsourced. In the specific case of Renault, the EGF does not authorise the cofinancing of passive measures. What is the current situation in the case of Renault? Neither the Renault Group, nor the French Government, nor the European Commission has been able to convince us that the training measures offered to workers at the time were active measures. What does that mean? It means real training programmes aimed at making people employable. That is the first thing. Secondly, I think that the case, in particular, of all the workers threatened with insecurity because they joined the early retirement scheme is not a specifically French issue – as has been said – but a question of European solidarity. All workers must be treated in the same way: some have nothing to gain from measures, while others do. I am pleased to hear my colleague, Mr Gauzès, for whom I have very high regard, tell us today, in this Chamber, that Renault has committed itself to take concrete measures. I am a little sad to hear this only today. I think he should have woken up long ago. Karima Delli,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis should in no way be used as a pretext for neglecting health and safety at work. Our aim is to provide good-quality employment to all workers, despite persistent mass unemployment and a sharp rise in casual work. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at work, 168 000 people die each year in Europe as a result of work-related accidents and illnesses, of which more than half are cancers, and one quarter are cardio-vascular diseases. How can we not be shocked by this growing number? As rapporteur for the review of the European strategy on health and safety at work, which will come to an end in 2012, my conclusions are clear. It would be morally wrong to turn a blind eye to people’s suffering at work. It would also be a mistake in economic terms, because all the studies indicate that accidents and professional illnesses are very costly, both to our health and social security systems and to our businesses. From 2013 onwards, this strategy should be more ambitious, more consistent and, above all, more courageous. To achieve that, we need to strengthen the legislative framework and adapt current legislation to new occupational hazards such as psychosocial risks, musculoskeletal problems and nanomaterials. Work-related stress should not be treated merely with training courses, as this has proven entirely insufficient given that half of all European workers are exposed to risks that affect their mental health. The truth should be spelled out. Workers suffer, in particular, from the sudden reorganisation or intensification of their work and poor methods of management. Furthermore, many employees draw attention to dangers for people as well as the environment. These workers must be protected. I am proud that Parliament is calling on the Commission to establish a directive that protects these much talked about whistle-blowers. The European Commission should not hesitate to bring infringement proceedings against Member States that do not respect their obligations. European harmonisation in the health sphere is a significant step forward. It is also vital to foster a culture of prevention in Europe. The Member States should increase the staff employed in their labour inspection services and seek to achieve the objective of one inspector per 10 000 workers, in accordance with International Labour Organisation recommendations. There is absolutely no justification for weakening the prevention rules in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or for independent workers, who enjoy the same fundamental right to health protection. Furthermore, we have observed an increase in outsourcing of work and the emergence of subcontracting chains. There are new groups of workers who are not covered by prevention policies: casual workers, bogus self-employed people, subcontracted workers, and so on. Given the risk of exposure to powerful radiation and the dangers linked to the management of radioactive waste, it is essential that rigorous standards are applied to training, safety at work and inspection by independent bodies. Finally, we need to take stock of new, emerging hazards, such as chemical and biological risks, which are complex but for which there is still insufficient data. Rapid action needs to be taken on asbestos, silica and other recognised carcinogens. The REACH provisions play a very important part in preventing cancers and other work-related diseases. It needs to be kept up-to-date and comprehensively implemented. Finally, professional illnesses should be recognised, or better recognised, starting with cancers, in order to quickly identify all of the issues. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on all of you to support my report, because I am perfectly sure that it will enable us to meet all these challenges, and that Europe has a role to play. It should protect all workers, who must not lose their lives on account of their job. Commissioner, I hope that, from 2013, there will be a European strategy on health and safety at work, and I truly hope that we will make swift progress on this. Karima Delli,

Madam President, Mr Daerden, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank Mr Daerden for the true spirit of cooperation that has marked the work of the committee. First, a small preliminary point. I would like to remind this House that if we want to combat poverty, there is no use trying the employability approach. In other words, nowadays, work is no longer a true protection against poverty. There are millions of poor people in work. I would like to highlight three particular points which I think are vital if we want to make progress with realistic objectives in the fight against poverty within the EU 2020 strategy. Firstly, the call for a legislative proposal on schemes for a minimum income equal to 60% of the average income in each Member State, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our Parliament one year ago. I think that, as the crisis has worsened, we have become aware that such a measure is essential for our poorest citizens. Secondly, the call for a framework directive targeted at guaranteeing the quality of, and especially accessibility to, all social services of general interest, particularly in health, education, public transport, energy and water. Thirdly, we are re-drafting a call to Member States to adopt at the earliest opportunity the proposal for a wide-ranging, anti-discrimination proposal. I welcome these latter two points which seem to me of utmost importance. We are calling for the implementation of a genuine European strategy to help the homeless. The Commission and the Member States can no longer turn a deaf ear to the issue of poor housing in Europe. A genuine solution must be found to these problems today. I am also delighted that we have reached a final agreement on negotiations over food aid, but we should not forget that we must now start thinking about the period after 2013, or more generally about earmarking substantial sums from the cohesion policy budget for the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Finally, I would like to encourage the participation, thanks to this report, of all civil society in the introduction of the platform, because we can only speak for the poor if we do so with them.

 The adoption of this report calling on the Commission to work towards introducing binding legislation on an adequate minimum income at the poverty threshold level, which is an indispensable tool for achieving the realistic objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020, is a major victory. To fight poverty, it is not enough to make speeches on growth: with 8.4% of workers poor in the EU, employment no longer protects against poverty. I am pleased that the proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to tax high incomes has been approved. It is high time that the Heads of State or Government understood that they are not there to serve the interests of the richest 1%, but to defend the 99%. I am pleased that people living in poverty will play a crucial role in the establishment of this platform. Today, policy must be drawn up ‘with’ and not just ‘for’ the poorest. I regret that our call for a framework directive on the quality and accessibility of social services of general interest was rejected. Universal access to public services is fundamental to the protection of the poorest. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently 80 million people living with a disability in Europe. Almost 70% of them are unemployed and 25% live in poverty. The European Union has a few aces up its sleeve to help these people and ensure greater equality of rights: raising more European funding, conducting widespread awareness campaigns, and compiling pan-European statistics in order to make public policies more effective. Above all, however, it is time to release the draft anti-discrimination directive, which has been blocked for over 10 years by Europe’s Heads of State or Government. I am pleased that my fellow MEPs have rallied behind us to ensure that the following message is heard loud and clear: the next stage in the fight for equal rights is an agreement between the EU Member States on this directive. Backed into a corner, the governments can no longer evade their responsibilities. We also call on the Commission to propose a major EU directive on accessibility for people with disabilities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the wave of redundancies that is affecting workers across Europe must lead us to reflect on the role that we, as political representatives, must play in the face of multinational firms that are acting without any social ethics, proceeding with shareholder-driven redundancies and relocating their operations in order to cut costs, increase their shareholders’ profits and please the rating agencies, with no regard whatsoever for social and environmental standards. In its resolution of 29 September on the future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), Parliament clearly expressed its desire to support, first and foremost, the workers adversely affected by restructuring. We called on the Commission to ensure consistency between EGF interventions and the European Union’s industrial policy, notably through the use of the structural funds. We also called for improvements in the future EGF Regulation to ensure that the fund does not generate moral hazard effects for multinational companies, as demonstrated today by the ArcelorMittal and Nokia cases. Commissioner, we can no longer continue to look separately at the structural funds and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund without taking into account the restructuring strategies of companies that benefit from them and without examining the cost-benefit ratio of a policy – and I shall say it again clearly – that benefits European workers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise. More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme. The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival. The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid. I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested. Parliament spoke some strong words last time, when we said that human beings are more important than finance. It is high time we reasserted that. In any case, Parliament will be extremely vigilant, and we will not hesitate to renew our call in a constructive manner. Karima Delli,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, a debate is being held in this House on the situation of homeless people! I should like to begin by paying tribute to all the associations in the community that work all year round to help the most vulnerable people among us, the homeless. Not having a home to call one’s own is a serious violation of fundamental rights and human dignity. It is the most visible and the saddest link in the chain of poor housing. Above all, it is an unacceptable form of injustice. It is crucial to understand why people end up on the streets, so that proper preventive policies can be put in place. Rather than looking for ways of getting these people off the streets, it is much easier not to plunge them into homelessness in the first place. When are we going to put a stop to tenant eviction? When are we going to stop property speculation? When will we finally realise that rising poverty and insecurity lead to exclusion? The face of homelessness has changed; the image of the bohemian down-and-out belongs in the past. The reality today is much more complex and much harsher. It is increasingly young people, women, families – in particular migrants – and even poor workers who are without a home. There are many types of homelessness. Of course, there are the homeless people that one sees on the floor in the street, in winter, under cardboard boxes, or in tents in public parks, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Millions of people live in emergency hostels, in temporary housing or with friends or family; they may even sleep in cars or in insalubrious hotels. Faced with an emergency situation that is becoming worse by the day, the associations are constantly sounding the alarm. However, governments come and go, and the scandalous failure to address the situation continues. It is high time the Member States faced up to their responsibilities. It is high time we put a stop to this shameful situation. Europe must strive to help the Member States establish fundamental values and long-term solutions to this situation, because our main duty is to protect the weakest among us. In the light of this unacceptable situation, we cannot continue to look the other way, in the same way as people avoid looking at homeless people on the street. What is worse, homeless people are expelled from town centres to the outskirts, far from the stares of businessmen and tourists. However, just because they are out of sight, it does not mean they do not exist! There is no point in hiding the problem; it needs to be resolved today. In one country, which you know well, Commissioner, homeless people are quite simply regarded as criminals. They are forbidden from sleeping on the streets, and are fined if they do, and the police hunt them down as far as underground stations or railway stations, despite the fact that there are no appropriate services in place to accommodate them. The time for communication, false political promises and campaign slogans, as we see in certain States, is now past. That is why, following the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, Parliament is calling on you to implement an integrated strategy aimed at resolving the problem of homelessness by 2020, based on the work that has already been carried out. This strategy should focus on five major objectives: firstly, preventing homelessness; secondly, reducing its duration; thirdly, targeting the most severe types of homelessness; fourthly, improving the quality of services for homeless people; and finally, providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing. This strategy must be coordinated with national and regional strategies. The results achieved with regard to the indicators developed jointly at European level must be regularly reviewed. Emphasis must be placed on social innovation, in particular, measures aimed at making housing the first step on the path towards social reintegration. Lastly, adequate funding must be guaranteed at both European and national level. Commissioner, all talk aside, this is an emergency. Action is needed now. This is a question of political will: people do not have to be made homeless. Let us not wait until winter to remember that people die on the streets all year round. It is possible to put a stop to homelessness, and I think that the European Parliament is showing the way. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1986, a great French actor, the founder of the Restos du coeur
 soup kitchens, said: ‘It is high time that we showed some solidarity.’ Twenty-five years on, what have we achieved? Poverty and inequalities are on the rise. It is high time that you faced up to your responsibilities. In particular, you need to prod into action all those Member States that are failing to help our poorest citizens. It is also high time that we eradicated poverty. How long are we going to wait before adopting a real framework directive on minimum pay that will allow everyone to live in dignity, but above all, will give them enough to eat and guarantee all of their fundamental rights? At a time when we are discussing a European platform against poverty and when we are being told that 43 million Europeans are at risk, you decide to cut the budget. That is a scandalous decision. Let me repeat that: it is scandalous. It is high time that … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty is the most cruel, most inhumane and most degrading penalty, and is a violation of the right to life, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Davinder Pal Singh is in danger of being executed imminently in New Delhi, in India, as the President of India rejected his plea for clemency in May, and it should be noted that this is the second appeal rejected in the course of that month. That is why this resolution sends a strong signal from the European Parliament. The European Parliament must condemn all executions, no matter where they take place. The European Parliament must encourage the European Union and its Member States to ensure that the United Nations resolution calling for a universal moratorium on executions is applied. The aim of this resolution is to achieve complete abolition in all those states that still apply capital punishment. I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed to this resolution. I shall simply mention in closing that I have tabled two amendments, because I would like to remind you that Davinder Pal Singh had already applied for political asylum in Germany, but he was forcibly deported to India, where he was arrested on his arrival in New Delhi in January 1995. Nevertheless, two years later, the Court in Frankfurt declared his expulsion to be illegal. He should therefore never have been deported to India, where his life was under threat. Finally, there is a wide range of evidence to suggest that Davinder Pal Singh did not receive a fair trial. That is the subject of the second amendment to be voted on. I would like to thank my fellow Members, and I hope that the entire resolution and the two amendments will be adopted. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the vote on the report by Mr De Rossa, which reminds us that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are at the heart of the European social model. We would point out that SSGIs are available to everyone and that we should ensure that everyone has access to them, especially with regard to social housing. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to propose legislation recognising universal access to basic banking services and to broadband Internet. Finally, we are asking for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between economic and non-economic services, which would provide greater protection for social services. Unfortunately, while the urgency of the economic and social situation would have required Members to demand a framework legislative tool on SSGIs, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed in its alternative resolution, my fellow Members refused to take that courageous initiative. The horizontal social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantee social rights, especially the right to access services of general interest. The time has come to prove to EU citizens that a social Europe is on its way and to give public services the place they deserve in European law. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, the cross-cutting social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon place a binding obligation on States to protect social rights and the right of access to services of general interest in particular. It is time we proved to Europe’s citizens that social Europe works. We must therefore give our body of social legislation its rightful place in EU law, by acknowledging the specific nature of social services of general interest where competition rules are concerned, bearing in mind that these services are strongly linked to local communities and rely on parties involved in the social economy. Mr De Rossa’s report is an opportunity to affirm principles that are simple and at the same strongly rooted in common sense, equality and universal access to these collectively run services, which contribute to social well-being and progress. Commissioner, you said: ‘The time has come to put ideas into practice.’ The time has come indeed, which is why I propose that in this debate you should provide real support for a European legislative instrument for public social services. I therefore call upon you to vote for the alternative motion for a resolution tabled by our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, cohesion policy must ensure harmonious and above all fair development between all territories. It is for this reason that we support the introduction of a new category of intermediary regions for the allocation of funds, as well as the application of new development indicators and indicators for social justice, well-being and environmental justice. We regret that this does not appear in the Pieper report. For the sake of fairness, cohesion policy must also tackle sub-regional development inequalities to restore meaning to the word ‘cohesion’, that is to say this solidarity which is the added value of the European Union. To achieve this, it must focus on inequalities, especially within urban areas, which are particularly affected by new challenges – social, environmental – and that is a huge task. Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there. It will also promote a new sustainable city, desirable for all, a model that meets the environmental, energetic and socio-demographic challenges, but one which places the living environment and the well-being of its inhabitants at the heart of our concerns. I will end with a clear message: after 2013, cohesion policy must have at its disposal much-needed and stable resources to be able to exist. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I am delighted that this report has been adopted, since most of our ideas (climate, social cohesion, integrated and bottom-up approach, disadvantaged neighbourhoods, cross-funding and so on) are included. However, I do regret that with regard to implementing the urban dimension, there is not a clearer signal in favour of a more widespread use of general subsidies for direct management by towns. Furthermore, this report should have elaborated on opening up deprived neighbourhoods, the role of medium-sized towns in the urban agenda, as well as the battle for climate and social mixing in our towns.

I welcome the ideas that have been taken forward, through the adoption of this report, to enhance synergies between policies with an impact on territories, on the one hand, and between funds, on the other hand, in particular by increasing financing and setting up multiregional programmes. I find it deplorable, however, that the involvement of local and regional powers in the decision-making process is not being viewed as a priority. Improving governance through the additional involvement of authorities with decentralised management capacities is the way to respond to the need for absorption, efficiency and simplification, all of which are desirable when implementing cohesion policy.

 By adopting this report, I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved, since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as ‘intermediate’ for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions. Karima Delli,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, first of all, I shall deal with the cultural and creative industries. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent. In this report, particular attention is paid to the working conditions in the sector, in particular, irregular income and insecure working relations, which call for an in-depth debate in order to take account of specific aspects, for instance, by fighting against discrimination in terms of remuneration, and to improve the match between job held and level of qualification. We want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content, and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards. Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes. I now turn to the ‘Youth on the Move’ scheme. Things are tough for young Europeans: whether accessing employment, education, accommodation, social services, they undergo what is tantamount to the ordeals of a social initiation ceremony. We need to restore their confidence in the future by providing adapted and ambitious answers. I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training. In this respect, I should like to stress the request, which I support, put to the European Commission, for a Green Paper on youth participation. Our report also highlights the idea of mobility, which should be accessible to all, and I welcome that. Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training. It would be regrettable to categorise young Europeans as either an educated elite, multilingual and confident in the future, or as young people left behind on the grounds that they do not have a Masters degree or because they are only doing manual work. I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme. I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people’s autonomy. Our report insists on the main desire of young people to be autonomous, to have access to healthcare in particular, and to have decent accommodation at a reasonable price. We all know that the young person who has no option but to work as well as study is heading towards failure in his/her studies. Finally, I am delighted that, in this House, it has been recognised that work placements should no longer be jobs in disguise, fully-fledged jobs. Work placements must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection. (Applause) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work. These women contribute to our economy, yet they suffer very poor working conditions and violations of their most basic rights. The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a ‘Convention on decent work for domestic workers’. This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards. The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as they have to commit to ratify this convention. At European level, we will also need to stop considering separately and systematically the immigration and labour policies. It is not right for domestic workers to be coerced into informal work, regardless of their rights, because of an immigration regulation that is too strict and ill-adapted. Karima Delli,

 Mr President, the United Nations report, published on 11 April, throws light on the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed in Sri Lanka in the conflict between the government forces of Mr Rajapaksa and the Tamil Tiger independence movement. The clashes in May and June 2009 gave rise to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and thousands of civilians lost their lives. We cannot accept the impunity of those responsible and of the authors of these crimes. The government of Mr Rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the UN report and it even contests its conclusions. In Sri Lanka, the press is muzzled, and journalists are subject to intimidation and arbitrary detention. The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations. The Tamil minority is the victim of a genocide that dare not speak its name. We must urgently send European Parliament observers to the north of Sri Lanka to see what is really happening there and reassert the principle of the self-determination of peoples. (The speaker agreed to take two blue card questions under Rule 149(8)) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Mr Tannock, I used that word by way of a metaphor, above all, to label the phenomenon. However, I have made it clear that it was not the name. The facts have to be established. In any case, what is happening to the Tamil minority cannot be shrugged off as a simply anodyne act. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 The European Parliament adopted a report, this Tuesday 5 April 2011, on fighting violence against women. This text emphasises the specific nature of violence against women and girls by men: it is indeed one of the most common and harmful obstacles to gender equality. Today’s report will make it possible to implement a criminal-law instrument in the form of a European Union directive to combat gender-based violence. Indeed, it establishes a European charter, which will ensure a minimum level of assistance, including the right to free legal aid and urgent psychological aid services. Furthermore, MEPs are calling on the Commission to establish a European observatory on violence against women. Thanks to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, an adopted amendment also calls for Member States to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship, as a crime.

 The European Parliament has voted in favour of the principle of creating a single work and residence permit for third-country nationals in a Member State. This procedure provides a set of common rights for these workers, particularly with regard to working conditions, such as working time and holidays. The text also sets out the principle of reimbursing pension contributions already made by workers who leave the EU, since they will be unable to receive their pensions after they retire. This text is problematic, however, since it reinforces the ‘country of origin’ principle for some categories of workers, a principle that was fought by the European left during the time of the famous ‘Bolkestein’ Directive. This principle creates a kind of two-speed labour market depending on the worker’s origin, and contributes to a form of social dumping. There is a contradiction here: do we really want to protect the European social model, and should it exclude non-European workers, or should it take a universalist approach and stop discriminating against workers by giving them different rights? This text does not yet resolve this fundamental issue, which is why I decided to abstain from voting on the text. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Parliament has adopted a good text. It emphasises Europe’s important role in ensuring the social inclusion of the Roma within the European Union, with the application of this strategy at local level. The report points out that a strategy for the Roma is possible only with the cooperation of members of the community – in short, we must work ‘with’ before we work ‘for’. The Roma should therefore be involved in any decision making. The text points out the difficult living conditions, discrimination and difficulties in accessing essential services that the Roma suffer. It points out the need to ensure respect for the freedom of movement of European citizens. It also mentions the importance, in social inclusion terms, of social protection, vocational training, education and public service provision. It denounces the insufficient allocation of funds, when the money could be put to good use. However, the real drawback of this report is the insistence by the conservatives in the European Parliament on mentioning the need to combat the Roma people’s so-called ‘prolonged dependence’ on the social welfare system. This is a scandalous prejudice aimed once again at marginalising the Roma community. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 This text does not stand out for its quality, since it is the result of a very broad compromise between the MEPs. It contains both elements that are very positive in the eyes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and certain ideas that we have sought in vain to denounce. However, the main thing is that it enables MEPs to express a rather progressive opinion on the EU 2020 strategy’s flagship programme dedicated to industry. Hence, the text calls for transport systems to be made more sustainable through the use of more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions. It points out the need to place energy and resource savings at the heart of European industrial policy. In this respect, it recalls the huge job potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield. The adoption of measures that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors. MEPs also sought to encourage all the efforts made to redress skills shortages in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry.

 I welcome the vote on this report on equality between men and women. In terms of remuneration, for example, and despite continued legislative efforts on the subject at European level, women still earn 18% less on average than men for the same work in the European Union. I would also like to emphasise that we had to battle for a long time within this Parliament merely to ensure that such a basic right as access to contraception could be mentioned. This kind of rearguard debate does little for the reputation of the European right. Luckily, the final report is a good one. It sets the objective of reducing the pay gap to less than 5% by 2020 and, in particular, calls on the Member States to do all they can to enforce the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’, with sanctions for non-compliant States. It calls for binding objectives to ensure equality in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

While today, the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative – a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion – this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 million people living in poverty in Europe, over 5 million homeless, millions poorly housed, one in five children victims of poverty, and, at the other end of the scale, what do we have? The number of billionaires is increasing. We have just held the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October and the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will soon draw to a close, but what will we have to show for this? What concrete solutions will Europe have offered to those who are the primary victims of a crisis for which they are not responsible? What hope can we offer my generation, this European generation bearing the brunt of unemployment, insecurity and exclusion, these young people who are mistrustful of Europe, who expect a lot from Europe and therefore from you? We are duty bound to answer their day-to-day concerns and their anxieties over the future. The Lisbon strategy has failed in its mission to eradicate poverty. We can no longer stand by idly and let things happen. Now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetoric. The time has come to be bold and show some political courage. All the organisations working with victims of poverty, ATD Fourth World, the European Anti-poverty Network (EAPN), the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), Emmaüs Europe, have been demanding this for 20 years! That is why we are asking the European Commission for a framework directive which aims to set an adequate minimum income. This framework directive will ensure eligibility for and access to an adequate minimum income so that any child, adult or elderly person living in poverty can break free from it, thus guaranteeing them their inalienable right to live in dignity. Time is running out, ladies and gentlemen, the need for action has never been more urgent. Together, we can put an end to the outrageous scandal that is long-term poverty. Poverty, end poverty, this should not be just a slogan. It is a reality and together, I hope, we will take on this battle. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Courard, Commissioner, the principal objective of the European Union, an objective which appears in the Treaty of Lisbon, is the development of a social market economy oriented towards full employment and social progress. It therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment, adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all EU policies. The recognition of social rights and, in particular, of the right to access services of general interest, is made binding in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter contains rights and principles, such as the right to access social security payments, housing benefits and social services. On the eve of the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, initiated by Parliament, how can you claim that, in applying the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, only the rules on competition and the internal market need apply to these social services of general interest, with no adaptation to their specific modes of organisation and financing? Is it not true that the Services Directive, for example, calls into question the role of social services of general interest with a strong local base consisting of community members who are not aiming for financial gain? When will you stop burying your head in the sand and when will you finally shoulder your responsibility as colegislator, in accordance with the provisions of the new Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the positive progress that this directive represents in the face of the urgent need to combat climate change. 2010 is the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The European Partnership for Energy and the Environment (EPEE) estimates that between 50 and 125 million Europeans suffer from energy poverty. However, this new legislation concerns only new buildings and will affect only 2.7 million new homes per year, when there are 200 million old homes in the European Union. The fact is, at least 150 million homes will have to be renovated by 2050 in order to attain factor 4. Commissioner, since 2007, 4% of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has been set aside to improve the energy performance of buildings, but has been used only to a very limited extent. How, then, are you going to put pressure on the Member States to really use these funds, because if they go unused, they are liable to disappear from 2013, when some of them will actually have to be increased?

Mr President, 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and it is in this context that we shall adopt, I hope, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij, which represents a major advance in the improvement of the living conditions of disadvantaged populations, insofar as it makes eligible for European aid, via the ERDF, projects for renovating and building housing and for combating energy poverty in all the Member States. This proposal, which is supported by the Council of Europe, has long been awaited by all those who campaign for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities, and particularly of the Roma. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the fact that the Union is investing heavily in the improvement of housing for the most disadvantaged communities, but we must not stop now that we are doing so well. We will be very vigilant with regard to the actual use of these funds, since they must not result in the exclusion of marginalised communities. Indeed, there are numerous examples of urban renovation projects. They include the restoration of the city centre of Barcelona, and the work to regenerate the historic centres in the new Member States, which have done particularly well out of real estate speculation through the explosion in rent and rental charges. This, in turn, has led to the most disadvantaged families being driven away from the city centres. These people absolutely must receive genuine social support and access to all public services, such as education, health care and public transport, but – as we proposed during the examination in committee – they must also receive resources sufficient to enable them to remain in these neighbourhoods, so that the latter do not become gentrified. Parliament will have to evaluate the projects carried out before these funds are renewed in 2013 and will have to be involved in drafting the future regulation laying down the eligibility criteria, particularly in relation to transparency, so as to ensure that every single vulnerable population actually receives these funds and is afforded a dignified existence in the long term.

Madam President, President Václav Havel’s speech to our House highlighted one of the fundamental principles of the European Union: solidarity among human beings. We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that wall of shame. Following 9 November 1989, we were told that humanity would finally be set free. Democracy and human rights were supposed to extend to the entire planet, knocking down walls, removing barriers between peoples. However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent? The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the Sri Lankan Government has maintained a wall of silence regarding the situation of the Tamil civilian population, preventing foreign media and humanitarian organisations from gaining access to them. Since March 2009, Colombo has been holding almost all of the civilians who fled the fighting between the army and the Tamil Tigers, in complete violation of international law and human rights. In July, the Sri Lankan Government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north-east of the island. The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases. In some camps, more than 1 000 people are dying every week, mainly of dysentery. The living conditions are appalling. President Rajapaksa declared last week that only 100 000 Tamil refugees would be released. In view of the scale of the tragedy, the European Union must step up the pressure on the Sri Lankan Government in order to obtain the immediate and unconditional release of all the civilians, access to the camps for journalists and the prompt delivery of humanitarian aid.

Mr President, my speech concerns the deterioration in working conditions in Europe. Today, nearly half of the people working in the world earn less than USD 2 a day. 12.3 million people are still victims of slavery, and more than 200 million children are forced to work. In Europe, the number of working poor is increasing day by day, and each year the International Labour Organisation records 160 000 deaths linked to a lack of prevention. In this context, I would like to emphasise our responsibility towards all those who are deprived of jobs and social rights, who work in unfit conditions, towards those millions of workers who suffer mentally and physically, who are, at times, driven to suicide, or who are victims of cancers or chronic diseases caused by their working conditions. It is time to break with the religion that dictates that we must work harder, and to stop the race to make profits and to compete in the short term. Guaranteeing the right to decent work and strengthening labour law must be the Union’s top priority over the next 10 years. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleagues have said, the image of the European Union that Erasmus gives is a good one. Endangering this standard-bearer for the European Union, which has done so much to create a positive image and which meets the needs of young people at a time when many of our fellow citizens are having doubts about the European project, is tragic. The Council representatives present have underlined the many problems there are in 2012 and also concerning the future funding of Erasmus, but have not given any firm answers. The question being put to the Member States today, on which there is a consensus in Parliament, is this: are you going to increase your contributions to its funding to meet the commitments you have made? Quite apart from Erasmus, the issue of funding for education programmes and also for the Cohesion Fund is equally tragic. Personally, I am a supporter of independent financing of the EU budget, which would liberate us from the Member States’ erratic decision-making. Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ever since President Mubarak’s fall in February 2011, Egypt has been run by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which gave itself the powers to legislate and to draft the Constitution. How can we not be worried? It was against this backdrop that Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, was elected on 24 June. For many Egyptian women, Mohamed Morsi's election jeopardises women’s rights. It should be pointed out that Islamist MPs had previously proposed reforming a provision that allows women to divorce without their husband’s consent. Similarly, they tried to pass a law banning women from seeking a divorce. Women must be listened to and their demands heard. Without them, democracy in Egypt will not be possible. They call for the provisions of the Charter on Women's Rights to be implemented in Egypt, a charter established last year by more than a thousand women and approved by half a million Egyptian citizens, men and women alike. This document sanctions fundamental rights such as the right to participate in political and economic life, representation in government and equality before the law. The Egyptian legal system must protect women against all forms of violence. We absolutely must support these demands, demands which are legitimate. Will Baroness Ashton support them? What steps will she consider to support Egypt on the road to democracy? How can we, as Europeans, respond to the concerns of these young people and women who fear that the arrival of the Islamists … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to add a few words to what Mr Alfonsi has said, and to applaud his work. Macro-regional strategies offer very interesting prospects for decentralised collaborative projects in the Mediterranean region. I think they provide an appropriate framework for the problems of this region, where, in the light of last year’s events, we must develop active neighbourhood policies, aimed at young people in particular. I would like to stress three particular points from my opinion. The first is cooperation in the field of youth, by promoting the European programmes designed for them, and through synergies with the work of the Mediterranean Office for Youth, which needs to be more publicised. The second is the creation of networks between Euro-Mediterranean universities and the removal of obstacles to the movement of students, lecturers and researchers, by simplifying visa procedures for these groups in particular. This is essential and urgent. The third is the quality of teaching and research in these networks, to be achieved by supporting and adequately funding the Tempus and Erasmus Mundus programmes and, I must stress, by automatically granting visas to these groups when they join the European programmes. Thank you to Mr Alfonsi for his productive collaboration, and thank you to all the Members who contributed to this report. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of Volunteering 2011 served to put volunteering under the spotlight and to give the voluntary sector an opportunity to put forward valuable recommendations. I congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission for their contributions on this issue. Mr Scurria’s report highlights the importance of ensuring that all citizens have access to volunteering activities and have the right to make their own contribution in order to support altruism and solidarity in their local area. Volunteering and community work as a whole represent an antidote to the changes in the labour market and to the risk of excluding parts of the population from enjoying basic goods and services. For our group, volunteering must not be a new way of getting people into insecure employment. It is about clearly differentiating between the value of volunteering, provided free of charge, and profit-making activities. Furthermore, we encourage Member States to recognise the rights of volunteers and to use the European Charter on the Rights and Responsibilities of Volunteers as a point of reference.

This report supports the Commission’s policy of taking a liberal approach. Deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) entail the dismantling of tariff barriers and opening of markets and may weaken these emerging economies. Social, environmental, educational and cultural issues are not addressed sufficiently, contrary to the aspirations of the people. Furthermore, DCFTAs are the result of a long process with strict criteria, particularly the obligation to align with European internal market regulations. In addition, these numerous requirements are not related to the prospect of integration into the European Union, as may have been the case for the countries of Eastern Europe. Do we need reminding of the EU’s failure in relation to the Mediterranean? These agreements focus on bilateral relations, failing to provide support for the regional integration of these countries. Instead, such agreements pit these countries against each other for the honour of being ‘champions’ who meet their criteria. At a time when Europeans are considering the possibility of European protectionism, we are demanding the opposite from our Southern partners. Is that really consistent? Is it fair? I do not believe so and that is why I am voting against this report, despite the fact that it does have some positive aspects. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, we cannot remain indifferent to or silent about the tragic situation suffered by the Syrian people as they face Bashar al-Assad’s bloody regime. We cannot abandon the Syrian people. First, let us firmly state our support for, and solidarity with, the Syrian people who are suffering. What strategy shall we build? What can we do? First, condemn the veto exercised at the UN by the Chinese and Russian governments and demand that NGOs and journalists be allowed to operate on Syrian territory. Next, support the people by supplying the medicines and medical equipment that they are lacking, bearing in mind that even rural hospitals are being attacked. Medicine cannot be used as a weapon. It is also important to contribute to the setting up of a humanitarian corridor. Finally, we must recognise and support the Syrian opposition around the Syrian National Council so that they can rebuild a state that matches the aspirations of the Syrian people. Furthermore, we must send Assad and those responsible for crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to two points regarding two of our partners on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. The first point is the concern of many Algerians regarding current reforms and, in particular, the law on associations to be voted on in the Algerian Parliament. Algerian civil society is concerned that this law could stifle society as a result of two new things that it introduces. Firstly, all associations will have to apply for a licence in order to exist. Secondly, foreign funding, including European, will no longer be allowed. The second point is that in Tunisia, at a time when the rule of law is being established and a new constitution negotiated, independent judges want our support so that they have the means to work towards establishing an independent judiciary and the training of Tunisian judges in transitional justice. Commissioner, will you respond to these concerns and these demands? Malika Benarab-Attou

 Mr President, at a time when Tunisia has just held its first democratic elections, the Member States of the European Union are still struggling to support the aspirations of those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and to demonstrate real solidarity. The Council’s reactions to the revolutions in the countries on the southern shore can no longer be limited to declarations of principle and short-term objectives. The European Union must move up a gear by proposing concrete, long-term measures. This is the purpose of this resettlement programme. The conclusion – at last – of the ordinary legislative procedure on this issue and, by extension, the application by all the Member States of the common European programme on the resettlement of refugees, at a historic moment in time, would bear witness to our will to react effectively by working together to propose suitable instruments. Currently, only 10 Member States participate annually in the resettlement of refugees, and there is no proper coordination when they do. Yet the representatives of the EU Member States have said again in recent months that they support the peoples’ aspirations. This support for the people of partner countries must result in Europe showing solidarity by accommodating refugees. The European resettlement programme should be an additional tool for protecting refugees and asylum seekers. It should allow for the implementation of a European hospitality policy for resettled populations. It needs to be implemented urgently. We must break the deadlock before the end of 2011, and it is up to the Council to do this. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Bastos, for her work and fruitful working relationship with the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, of which I am one. We agree with the Commission’s observation as regards the need to raise the qualification levels of young Europeans as well as the need to redefine certain skills that students might need today. We must not limit our proposals to satisfying the needs of labour market areas; we must also guarantee fair and universal access to quality public education and lifelong learning, so as to promote the intellectual and social development of every citizen, and particularly of young people, given the unacceptably high rate of unemployment among that age group. In order to achieve this, I believe there are two crucial aspects: firstly, digital literacy, which is becoming increasingly important for our evolving knowledge-based society. Emphasis must be placed, first and foremost, on literacy-based initiatives, and on refreshing and updating key skills in the field of communication and information technology, so as to reduce, or indeed eliminate, the digital divide. The next step for the Member States, therefore, is to integrate digital culture into teaching and training systems, while teaching a critical approach to modern forms of communication and media content. Secondly, and more generally, education and training have a place in the Green New Deal that we environmentalists wish to implement in the European Union. Indeed, we need to start by speeding up the transition towards a sustainable economy and developing the huge potential for green jobs that exists throughout Europe, with a view to protecting and restoring environmental quality and the quality of life of our fellow citizens across a wide range of sectors, such as transport, energy supply and even public services … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, how much longer are we going to ask Tunisians indirectly to bear the dramatic consequences of our poor management of aid to the refugees? The solidarity shown by Tunisian society is crumbling. We can no longer remain indifferent to the health situation and the new outbreaks of diseases in the camps. It has to be recognised that we, the European Union, have failed on several points: an inhumane migration policy; shameful humanitarian aid measures to tackle the huge needs on the ground; a lack of European solidarity, calling into question the very foundations of Europe. How do we, as European defenders of human rights, see ourselves? What support is the European Union talking about when it addresses people who have, today, effected their democratic revolution? We have the resources to help these refugees but, if there is no political will or tangible force, the Mediterranean will remain a cemetery. Is this acceptable? Can we continue in this way? We must reconsider the issue of the refugees and migration on the basis of a human rights approach taking into account the new political situations. The security approach and the ‘dusting’ carried out by the Frontex Agency are no match for our high standards and values. In the short, medium and long term, the financial assistance given by the European Union must be directed at strengthening the capacities of civil society in Tunisia, in particular, and in the countries of the south more generally. I should like to conclude by stressing that the immigrants of today are resources and not a burden. Am I not an example? Yesterday an immigrant, today a Member of the European Parliament.

 Madam President, the peoples of the southern Mediterranean expect a strong gesture of solidarity and support from us amid the upheaval and the challenges they face. These are peoples whom we colonised in the recent past, which means that we have an added responsibility. In supporting their democratic transition, we must devise, here in Europe, a true policy of hospitality that is consistent with our value of fraternity. Devising a policy of hospitality means, first of all, reviewing the reception conditions at our borders and ensuring that the fundamental rights of those who cross them are respected. It also means finding a solution for the thousands of young people who are dying in the Mediterranean, before our very eyes. This is unacceptable. This report, despite including new clauses on respect for human rights and fundamental rights in Frontex’s mandate, is not aimed at a new policy of hospitality. Despite the proposed changes, Frontex’s mandate is still confined to a repressive ‘fortress Europe’ attitude. We must continue our efforts to guarantee more thorough assessments of Frontex operations, with the help of an independent monitoring body, so as to ensure respect for democracy and fundamental rights set out in our report.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the demands for democracy, freedom and dignity of the peoples of the southern Mediterranean call for action from us here in Europe, their northern Mediterranean neighbours. We have taken too long to respond – or, in some cases, not to respond – to these long-standing needs, in keeping with the values that we preach. First Algeria, then Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Morocco, Jordan: the people of the southern Mediterranean are reminding us of a longing to be able to live according to the universal values of equality, freedom and brotherhood. The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) might be the project on which our new relationship could be based, around common values of solidarity and respect for the law. However, the UfM has come up against Israel’s policies, as it continues to flout international law and to colonise Palestinian territory. The UfM summit has been cancelled twice because of this. It is time we put our words into action and stopped applying double standards. Baroness Ashton, will you dare to take action that will allow the Palestinian state to exist within its 1967 borders and lift the blockade on Gaza? The time has come to do this if we do not want to lose credibility in the eyes of our southern neighbours. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the G8 countries decided to grant the sum of USD 40 billion to Tunisia and Egypt, as has already been said. However, the European Union must present the case for greater transparency, visibility and traceability; in short, better governance of this aid. We need to focus on four key points: first, ensuring that development cooperation is in keeping with the principles of democracy and absolute transparency; second, guaranteeing respect for human rights; strengthening the role and capacities of civil society organisations and reforming the system of governance that applies to aid, with stronger involvement by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, the EU must be able to guarantee that this aid reaches the people it is intended for. What concrete measures is the EU planning in this respect? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports by Mrs Schaake and Mrs Sanchez-Schmid remind us that culture is not a decoration motif but the fruit of complex interdependencies, showing that cultural questions should be addressed in a transverse manner and integrated into all European policies, internal as well as external, social as well as economic. In this respect, I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees, with the European Commission’s other services, as well as with Baroness Ashton’s European External Action Service. Furthermore, I would like to come back to a point that has not been expanded on in these reports, concerning the mobility of artists and of professionals in the cultural sector. Indeed, this issue is of major importance for the emergence of a European cultural area. In this regard, two aspects seem to me to be important; namely, firstly, the dissemination by the European Union and Member States of clear and understandable information on regulations and procedures currently in force. Secondly, the removal – as has already been said – of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union. I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas. Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries. Therefore, Europe should reposition itself and not abandon the battle over soft power, since what is at stake here today is respect for cultural diversity as a tool for dialogue and as a guarantee of peace and stability worldwide.

 Madam President, Commissioner, in your description of the outlook for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the Southern Mediterranean, you referred to potential catalysts. However, you forgot to mention one group, to which I myself belong. In Europe, people like me –immigrants and the children of immigrants – who come from the area that was once colonised by Europe, are still stigmatised. Yet we are, and we could become, human resources: influential mediators between north and south at this historic time. Commissioner Füle, what are your thoughts on that option? Will you take it into consideration? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, this report is sensitive, and I must criticise its title. The use of the words ‘migration flows’ sets the tone: it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or invaders. These are historic times for the peoples of the Southern Mediterranean and us, but the fear of mass immigration is preventing the EU and the Member States from creating a new dynamic. The recent democratic movements in the South have helped make us aware of our contradictions. They have demonstrated once again the inconsistency and lack of vision of our obsolete and out-of-touch cooperation policies. It is high time the European Union implemented a migration policy that is consistent with our values, that recognises that we live in a world in which people are mobile, a world in which human beings move around. To continue to talk about migration flows is absurd and goes against our humanist values. If we Europeans want to be major players in the world, then we have to change our approach and work towards creating a solidarity-based Union for the Mediterranean; we cannot do so without revising mobility policy, or what is today referred to as migration policy. We must meet the expectations of the peoples of the South. The fear of immigration must no longer guide our policies. Strengthening border controls must no longer be our main motivation in implementing cooperation agreements, as it was in the case of Libya. We must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements, so that we respect human rights. Our actions are still characterised by a security-driven approach to mobility, which goes against our values and the requirement we have to protect populations. The scandalous position adopted by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Guéant must be vigorously denounced. Commissioner, what kind of policy must we adopt in order to establish a true Union for the Mediterranean, one in which we show solidarity with the peoples of the South, who today feel scorned by us?

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, having mistakenly supported dictatorial regimes along the southern coast of the Mediterranean, supposedly as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism, we now need to rise to the challenge presented by these historic events. Europe needs to revise its current policy on authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. President Mubarak must step down now. It behoves us to support the democracies and democratic processes chosen by the people of these countries, not simply to impose our own vision. Let us listen to their voices, let us exercise humility, let us not confuse secularism and security. Change is already happening in these countries. Our financial instruments need to be adapted in order to provide reliable support for the champions of democracy … (The President cut off the speaker

Our fellow citizens must be better informed about country of origin marking and must be able to make purchases in full knowledge of the facts. Europeans still do not know, in fact, whether they are buying goods that have genuinely been produced in Israel or which have come from Israeli colonies in Palestinian territories.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), two out of thirteen cross-border cooperation programmes are dedicated to the Mediterranean Basin. The first is the cooperation programme for the Mediterranean Basin. With the new generation of European funds for 2007-2013, the European Union has decided to resolutely develop cooperation actions between the north and south shores of the Mediterranean. To this end, the European Union has established the Mediterranean Sea Basin ENPI programme. What territories exactly does this programme apply to? What projects could be co-financed, given that we know that the cooperation programme finances 80% of the total cost of the cooperation programmes in which partner programmes representing at least three eligible countries in a very wide range of fields participate? The second part of the ENPI cross-border programme for Italy and Tunisia has a total allocation for 2007-2013 of EUR 25 191 million. The eligible regions are in Italy and Tunisia. The management authority is the region of Sicily, with Palermo. The objective of the cross-border cooperation programme for Italy and Tunisia is to encourage economic, institutional and cultural integration of the Tunisian and Sicilian regions through a process of joint sustainable development in the context of cross-border cooperation. The programme has three priorities. The first is regional development and regional integration. The second is to encourage sustainable development, through the management of agricultural and fisheries resources, to protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage and to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. My question is as follows: what measures have been put in place to monitor the trade in coral, a fisheries resource that is endangered and the subject of illegal trafficking? The third priority is cultural and scientific cooperation, and support for networks, by strengthening cooperation at association level, training and exchanges between young people and students. My question is as follows: how, beyond the objective of funding, do we ensure that this programme of human exchanges takes place given the obstacles associated with the implementation of the Return Directive by European countries and the management of Schengen visas?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Alps are one of the most heavily built-up mountain regions in Europe. They contain the most important water resources, but their current economic situation makes them vulnerable to global warming. The Alps could play a fundamental role by becoming carbon-neutral by 2050, as defined by the four Environment Ministers of the German-speaking Alpine countries in June this year. They could become the region of choice for creating renewable energy and contributing to achieving the 20% target for 2020. (The speaker broke off) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive drying-up of the Jordan River is a direct consequence of the tragedy that Palestine is experiencing. Water is a highly political issue. Let us not forget that. Let us remember some facts: the World Bank informs us that, for two years, the one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been without chlorine, which is essential for disinfecting the water; 50% of homes did not have access to water before the bombings of January 2009, so imagine what it is like now. Médecins sans Frontières
 say that, now, following the attacks by the Israeli army on the infrastructure, 90% of the water supplied to the inhabitants is unfit for human consumption. Every day, 80 million litres of untreatable sewage is discharged into our Mediterranean as a result of the destruction inflicted on the infrastructure in Gaza. It is true that Baroness Ashton has visited Gaza on several occasions, but where is the political courage to apply to Israel the same standards as we have in Europe? Must clean water, like the land, be monopolised by the Israeli settlers? Consequently, the European Union must suspend the association agreement with the current Israeli Government, which remains deaf to all our requests, whilst the occupation and the settlements, which are illegal, remain. Without justice, there will be no peace. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the situation imposed on the Roma – their expulsion and the denial of their right to free movement in Europe – is unacceptable and goes against European values. However, this situation is but the symptom of a more serious and more general problem. It is merely the reflection of a disease in our so-called modern societies, where we are losing sight of what binds us together as human beings. No, human beings are not commodities that can be stocked and destocked. The policy that we, as the European Union, follow on issues relating to the movement of persons within the Union and to entry and exit from third countries is unacceptable. We cannot pursue this policy of a besieged and timid Europe. The free movement of persons is fundamental. It has always been so, and it is the foundation on which our present-day societies are built. Today, equality is no longer guaranteed where the movement of European and non-European citizens is concerned. While European tourists and pensioners travel freely and in huge numbers to the South, especially to the Maghreb, the citizens of those same countries are unable to move around. The Schengen visas and their application by the EU Member States are inhuman. The considerable barriers to movement prevent citizens of the South from coming to the countries of the North as tourists, friends or family members. President Barroso, what action – bold, concrete action – are you going to take to enable us to adhere to our values once again on this issue? Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean has never been as vital to our future as it is today. Together we have tried, in the report on the UfM, to support a different vision of our Mediterranean. More than just a simple free trade zone, it is a Union founded on the common civilisation of people who share fundamental values. I should like to talk about the most serious obstacle to our Mediterranean ambitions; the violence suffered by the Palestinian people, who are being occupied, expelled and killed by Israel, while Europe fails to assume its historic responsibility in this conflict and really act for peace by recognising the State of Palestine in accordance with the international laws on which our democracies are founded. This coming week, an official Parliament delegation will visit the Gaza Strip in a bid to understand why aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro which Europeans are sending Palestinians is not arriving in the schools and hospitals in Gaza, which I visited in January. I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided, without informing either his members – of whom I am one – or the co-chairs of this delegation, not to visit Gaza with Parliament’s delegation on the instructions of the Israeli Embassy. By boycotting Parliament’s delegation to Gaza, our committee chair is discrediting the whole of Parliament, which passed a resolution on the Goldstone report condemning the fact that contacts with the populations in Gaza were being blocked by the Israeli army and demanding that the block be lifted immediately. We need to remember this resolution and Parliament’s position. This being so, I call for Mr Albertini to resign as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, for failing to meet the demands of his office. What is the point of financing and supervising elections, if we then refuse to recognise those who have chosen the ballot box over arms? Finally, another obstacle to a really fraternal Union for the Mediterranean is the victims who drown on their way from the south side, partly due to the fact that European borders are completely closed to them. Our current migration policy is no longer acceptable. We need to be able, as the UNDP recommends, to ensure that the mobility of citizens from the South is equal to our own mobility to the South. We must be faithful to our project and to our values. Our children will thank us for it and we will be the proud representatives of our peoples. Malika Benarab-Attou,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the value of this report in opening up the debate, within our Parliament, on the position and role of universities in Europe. These universities must, in fact, be encouraged to participate in European integration from the inside rather than to contemplate it from the outside. Over the course of European history, universities have always been places where meetings are held, knowledge is exchanged, thought is developed and training is delivered in the various disciplines. Today, the effects of the crisis and of unemployment must not result in universities restricting their role as providers of professionals who are immediately ready to work because, in our changing societies, the ability to change jobs is becoming vital. On the contrary, universities, as places of higher education and training, must also enable learners to become critical, analytical thinkers, because this will enable them to understand the world in which we live and to use their professional skills wisely. European universities must create the conditions for lifelong learning, contribute to the enrichment of intellectual life and play a central role in the knowledge-based society of today’s digital age.

Mr President, President of the European Investment Bank, in the EIB’s 2008 report, Parliament insisted that the bank’s external activities comply with the general objectives of the European Union. That is why the project to finance a nuclear power station in Jordan would go against the foundations of Article 3(5) of the Treaty on European Union. I quote, ‘In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the sustainable development of the Earth’. In February 2009, the Jordanian authorities contacted the EIB seeking support for their nuclear energy development project, which involves, in particular, the construction of a nuclear power station by 2016. It is therefore with some satisfaction that I have received the assurance of your services that the European Investment Bank did not grant this request and that it considers that its job is to support projects in Jordan aimed at developing wind and solar power, which are energies of the future for our planet because they are renewable. Will this position be pursued for other requests to finance nuclear power stations? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europeana project is taking on a new, ambitious dimension. With this EU digital library, the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible. It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project. A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. One of our continent’s horizons is Africa, but we have blackened that horizon with slavery and colonialism. We have a duty of recognition and reparation towards its peoples. Financial compensation could not meet this need alone, but thanks to the Europeana project, we can help to return to the African peoples part of their culture in terms of its oral literature. Amadou Hampâté Bâ, a Malian intellectual, said: ‘In Africa, when an old person dies, it is a library that burns’. Working to digitise works of oral literature, which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists, and encouraging free access to them through the Europeana project, thereby making them universal in scale, would be a way of protecting and giving life to humanity’s cultural diversity, to which we are all attached.

 Mr President, I am wondering what actions the European Union will introduce to ensure that all Member States observe the right of asylum and respect the human rights of people arriving from the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Many of them are arriving in flimsy craft, and several thousand Africans are drowning without anyone protesting. Are the Council and the Commission really sensitive to these issues, which fall under the headings of both human rights and humanitarian aid? Mr Moratinos’s statements with regard to the strengthening of the security approach and the additional resources allocated to Frontex, decided recently by the Council, do not reassure me in this regard. Ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to act to bring our actions into line with our values. This is urgent, because there are lives at risk. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, on 14 January, I met with members of the Tunisian delegation. We had a frank exchange and debated our respective views. As a Franco-Algerian, I am committed to the Maghreb and I campaign for a united, pluralist and democratic Maghreb. The issue of human rights is crucially important to me, and it is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. The debate on this issue, as it appears in Tunisia, is crucial and relevant. Yesterday morning, I met Mr Ben Brik’s wife, who is leading a hunger strike, as well as activists from the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, and I am concerned. It seems that Mr Ben Brik’s life is in danger due to his illness and his detention conditions. I am sure you realise that if this concern should become a reality, the responsibility will fall very heavily on the shoulders of the Tunisian authorities. Aside from trade relations, we must also take account of social issues. The phenomenon of young Tunisians throwing themselves into the Mediterranean is the product of a closed society that offers no prospects to its young people. The defence against fundamentalism and economic imperatives must not serve as pretexts for ignoring human rights. Real progress in the field of human rights is now crucial. We are not talking here about sanctimonious dogmatism but about an urgent situation that the European Union must help to resolve. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr Barroso, I would like to inform you that, in a few days’ time, we will be observing the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The situation of the crushed, colonised, wounded, killed Palestinian population must not continue. We Europeans, through our values of solidarity and fraternity, have a responsibility to find a solution to this situation quickly, before it turns into a bloodbath. The Israeli Government is continuing its colonisations by forced march, and this after it committed war crimes at the start of this year. Symbols and tears are no longer enough. Today, the only solution to stop this deadly policy of the Israeli Government is the recognition and, above all, the existence of the Palestinian State. The Palestinian people, like other peoples, have a right to a dignified existence that fulfils their aspirations. As President of the Commission, and together with Mrs Ashton, will you take action along these lines and, if so, how? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied by the response that Commissioner Dimas was able to give on this issue and, in particular, by his speaking of the importance of aid beyond the borders of our continent. In addition to environmental protection of the Mediterranean Sea, might one formally propose, as part of the Union for the Mediterranean project, this emergency aid in the event of fire and the development of forestry expertise on this subject, to be shared and developed with the non-European countries of the Union for the Mediterranean?

 Mr President, Commissioners, in my view there has been an extraordinary degree of misinformation during this debate. Why? Because, in the first instance, we had an exhibition – I think Polish Members arranged it – that looks as if it is on the part of citizens but, when you look more closely, it turns out it is financed by a coalition of shale gas industry associations. I would say that is false advertising; it is masquerading as something it is not! That is the problem we have with this exhibition. Secondly, you may have forgotten, but the Commissioners mentioned it, there are reports which the Commission requested. I would ask you to read them carefully, because the report on the environment shows all too clearly that there is a risk of polluting surface water and groundwater and of depleting water resources. The impact on the soil can be devastating and can also lead to atmospheric pollution. Yet people say there are no such risks. It is not a question of being for or against shale gas, because decisions on energy mix are a question of national sovereignty. Our task, as elected officials, as MEPs, is to protect the European public. These reports show that there are clearly identified shortcomings in the legislation: poor adaptation of the Water Framework Directive, management of waste needs to be integrated into the Mining Waste Directive, and fracking needs to be integrated into the Environmental Impact Assessments Directive. If we do not overcome these failings, we will face serious difficulties, as seen in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, companies should be fully liable. They should have to prove that they have sufficient financial guarantees to honour the polluter pays principle in the event of environmental damage. It is not up to industry to decide what our energy future will be, but up to the citizens. Finally, with the support of around a hundred MEPs, we have tabled an amendment calling for a moratorium on fracking in the European Union. I hope as many MEPs as possible will remember their responsibilities when it comes to voting and will show that lobbyists do not hold all the power in Brussels.

 Mr President, Mr Grzyb, I would like to stress that Poland is in breach of the Water Framework Directive. You have already been asked to adhere to the standards laid down in that directive. The second problem with fracking is its social acceptability. The Commissioner mentioned this earlier. When people are made aware that exploitation comes with risks, it is still up to them to decide, as was the case in France and Bulgaria. At the same time, in relation to the risk presented by CO2
, which came up just now, shale gas cannot replace all sources of energy. You have to develop renewables. Europe is doing just that, Commissioner Oettinger spoke about it, and you also have the opportunity to do so in Poland. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I have a similar question. The problem with this exhibition is not that industrialists want to hold an exhibition. There’s no problem with that, but they must say that they are industrialists. When we have NGOS, they say they are NGOs. The problem here is the attempt to deceive us: we do not know who they really are, and when you scratch beneath the surface, as Mr Turmes said, you find out they are actually from the shale gas industry. That is what is not right and not the fact that lobbies can come to Parliament to try to influence people. There must be total transparency about who people are. Michèle Rivasi,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since we are going to give our opinion this week on the discharge of European agencies that are under suspicion about their management, since our institutions are deemed to be too open to the lobbies and it seems that the transparency measures taken so far have not succeeded in resolving these problems, since we rightly want exemplary, certified institutions without any conflicts of interest, since the Commission’s reputation is once again in tatters, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but also on behalf of numerous other Members of the European Parliament of all political persuasions, I want to ask you about the resignation of John Dalli and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, which has been planned for a long time. This unexpected affair is intriguing and has left me somewhat bewildered. There is something fishy about this alleged story of corruption and we have the right to find out all the details. Of course, Commissioners must not be above the law. They must answer for themselves like any other citizen. However, nor must Commissioners must be beneath the law and I have the feeling that John Dalli is being deprived of basic rights and, in particular, the presumption of innocence while there is no concrete and direct proof of his guilt. Several questions come to mind, therefore, and I would like the Commission to give us some insight into this affair. What legal provision, what regulation or what Treaty has Mr Dalli infringed with his behaviour? What is the Commission’s view of his alleged guilt? Is it not possible that this affair might be a manoeuvre to derail the Tobacco Products Directive? Commissioner, I would ask you to give us some details about this extraordinary situation and I call on OLAF to send us its report as soon as possible Moreover, I read Mr Barroso’s letter assuring us that the Tobacco Products Directive would not be postponed. However, we would like more information about the timetable, which is already more than a year behind. This long-awaited Directive is ready and I would ask the Commission to make every effort to implement it. Are we going to have to wait until Tonio Borg takes up his post? We believe that this is extremely urgent from a health perspective and that the Directive should therefore get back on track, because if we do not do it now, it will have to wait until the next parliamentary term. Who will win in that case? The tobacco lobby! Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially Mr Áder and Mr Seeber, for their valuable work on the revision of the Seveso Directive. As we debate the Seveso Directive, my thoughts turn to the accident that occurred in France, AZF – you will recall – in Toulouse. On 21 September 2001, a stock of ammonium nitrate exploded killing 31 people and wounding a further 2 500, who are still traumatised to this day. The damage caused was unbelievable. This was not due to the lack of risk assessment management. It was due to the subcontracting of subcontractors, that is to say, untrained people. The training of employees is also the best form of security. In any event, give or take a few minor details, I am pleased with the final result, in particular, the essential advances in the management of industrial risks, against which we need to protect our citizens in the race to underinvestment in safety features by integrating the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. This is very important for informing citizens in the interests of transparency, and it is a sine qua non
 of the organisation of an effective risk management plan. I have one reservation, Commissioner, which is that there is no assessment of the financial consequences of a major accident and proof of the capacity of companies to address them. That, in my opinion, is a shortcoming of this directive. Michèle Rivasi,

 Mr President, it is good that we have this resolution on water because it is proof of Parliament’s good intentions. I would like to highlight some problems. Firstly, in terms of water management. As we speak, the World Water Forum is being held in Marseille. Yet, as you know, there is strong criticism with regard to the conflict of interest arising from the fact that the president of this World Water Forum, Loïc Fauchon, is also the chief executive of the Marseille water service (Société des eaux de Marseille
), an affiliate of Veolia. This has therefore become a commercial forum rather than a general interest to see water become a shared global resource. In terms of water management, it is very important that water management is reallocated to local authorities under direct state supervision. This forum ended with a declaration claiming that private investment can guarantee the right to water, which logically leads the debate towards the privatisation of water systems. This is a problem for both European and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The second problem concerns water and health. When we see that 88% of the diseases in the world come from drinking dirty water, poor hygiene practices or inadequate sanitation services, we must seriously invest in the treatment of industrial waste water and waste water in particular, which are poured untreated into nature. This, nevertheless, represents 70% of waste water. My final point relates to water and energy. We cannot replace water. Yet, as you know, the problem of shale gas management may lead to problems with groundwater pollution, hence the importance of the framework directive on groundwater, where they realised in Canada and the United States that it could cause pollution. Therefore, if we are fighting for water quality, we must do so at all levels. Michèle Rivasi,

Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, and the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Polish Presidency on their constructive work. From now on, consumers will be guaranteed better information. Ms Ries spoke about the sofas imported from Asian countries that contained fungicides and we all know the consequences these had for consumers, including extensive skin problems and severe erythema. Consumers should absolutely have been informed that items had been treated, but that was not the case until now. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is essential to reinforce the substitution of highly dangerous active substances by strengthening the exclusion criteria but also by limiting the derogations and introducing national guarantees for the adjustment of the conditions of use of product authorisations. We welcome, too, Commissioner, the specific and detailed provisions on nanomaterials, which you mentioned. This is a very important matter because we will be informed, there will be labelling, and substances such as nano-silver will have to be specifically authorised and assessed separately, which is justification for the validity of the methods used for the supporting assessment. The only damper on things – as has been mentioned – is that Parliament has lost its right of veto regarding the approval of active substances. It would seem that that was the price we had to pay for these improvements. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would actually like to inform my fellow Members, since we were there with Ms Herczog in Cadarache, that the ITER project is not insured. Since we are trying to keep the ITER budget under control, I have asked the question twice, and I have been told: ‘But it is not … (The President asked the speaker to ask her question)
 Please can you explain why the ITER project is not insured? Who will pay if there is an accident? Will France alone have to pay? As it is an international project, I would have preferred all the states to contribute. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would like to raise two points that I feel are important. When we talk about generating electricity using this fusion, rather than fission reactor, we are talking about starting in 2100. Therefore, it is not really the most important priority at present. Secondly, people have been talking about keeping the budget under control, and I completely agree. The only problem is that in 2006, the budget was EUR 5 billion, whereas in 2011 it is EUR 15 billion: in other words, three times higher. On top of this, because of Fukushima the Japanese are now saying they will not be able to meet their commitments in two years’ time. This means that ITER will be delayed by another two years. A third factor, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, is that this is the first time that a facility like ITER, which entails certain risks, primarily of disruption – and I would invite you to read the studies that have been written on the subject – has not been insured. Why will the Indians, the Chinese and the Russians not insure it? It is because they do not want to increase the ITER budget any further. We are therefore setting ourselves on a collision course, and it would be better to stop now, rather than pour billions into a project that supposedly will be ready by 2100. For this reason, it is time we put an end to ITER. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I am grateful to Ms Ford for the work she has done, but I would like to point out that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution, one of the key points of which concerns the protection of sensitive natural areas, and specifically the Arctic. Indeed, granting exploration or exploitation licences means accepting liability, in the event of an accident of the kind we saw in the Gulf of Mexico and also in Scotland, for irreversible or very destructive damage in this unique part of the world. Furthermore, one is entitled to ask who is going to clean up this site in the event of an accident, since it is not an exclusive economic zone, and who defines its borders and hence the responsibilities relating to it: it is an area that belongs to everyone. I should like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to a number of points, the first of which is supervision. Supervision needs to be enhanced, but it would be good if it were carried out at European level and if the Maritime Safety Agency were responsible for it. Secondly, responsibilities need to be clearly defined. Amendment 76 establishes the full liability of oil companies, without any upper limit. At the same time, Amendment 47 defines civil liability, which covers not only environmental damage, but also social and economic damage, with guaranteed financial capacity to cover mandatory insurance. Including small oil companies in our deliberations is all well and good, but if they do not have any insurance, there is no point in granting them a licence. These points are therefore very important. Michèle Rivasi,

 Madam President, with what is happening with e.coli at the moment in Germany, France and other countries, I am a little surprised to note that it could be agued that, now we have solved the problem of animal-based meal, we should be able to give it to non-ruminants, including pigs, poultry and fish. To start with, I used to think that we do in fact have a lot of animal-based meal and that we could give it to all non-ruminants and herbivores, eliminate everything to give it to omnivores or carnivores. In fact, however, I see that, even if there were a whole set of constraints in place, we would not succeed. How are we going to monitor the existence of differentiated sectors? Let us take the example of a farm on which poultry and cattle co-exist. There will be animal-based meal for the poultry and other food for the cattle. The operator can easily make a mistake and give to the cattle what he gave to the poultry; there will be no guarantee, even if monitoring is carried out. I therefore asked a number of scientists, who told me that, as regards the problem of prion, which caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, there were still a huge number of scientific uncertainties. As far as consumers are concerned therefore – I know, Mr Dalli, that you are highly sensitive to the health of consumers – we must regain their confidence. You saw what happened with e.coli and you know the story about the cucumber. We learned that the cucumber was not to blame. I cannot see how, at the present time, farmers can be authorised to give animal-based meal to pigs and poultry. I believe that the solution is to say that our scientific knowledge is incomplete, draconian control and monitoring cannot be carried out, even if it is written into the texts, and that, as a precaution, it is better to place a ban on the feeding of animal-based meal to all animals.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire 
stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors. We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting. 80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors. Furthermore, we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risks. When we look at these stress tests as they relate to France, they become ‘relaxation tests’. Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France. This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue, but must be a European issue, the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I would nevertheless like to remind my fellow Members that the Fukushima accident is not over and that there are still risks of explosion relating to the molten core. I have a question to put to our Commissioner, Mr Oettinger. It is about the implementation of these stress tests. As our fellow Member has just said, how will you get a guarantee that all the criteria that you have mentioned to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are taken into account by each Member State that uses nuclear power stations? How will you force a Member State to allow independent experts to verify and monitor the power stations if it refuses? The reason I ask this is that, if they monitor themselves, I do not see how we will apply your stress tests. There absolutely must be an independent body monitoring the power stations in each Member State. How, furthermore, will we ensure that neighbouring countries – you spoke of Armenia, with Metsamor, and of other countries such as Belarus, and so on – accept such monitoring? Parliament will have to support you, Commissioner, but how will we do this? Finally, we have a real responsibility to phase out nuclear power, and this is where scenarios for achieving this must be proposed to Parliament. It is the only guarantee that there will be no further accidents. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, first of all something positive, Mr Barroso. I welcome the fact that you are going to adjust the European maximum levels in line with Japan’s levels, because at the time of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011, we realised that the levels proposed by the Commission were far too high. I welcome this therefore, and would like to see it incorporated into this regulation. My second point concerns imports of food products from Japan. There is a fundamental issue here. Are we going to be obliged to have contaminated food, although the contamination is below the maximum levels, in order to support the Japanese economy? I am sure you have children. I think to myself, am I going to give my children milk containing 500 Bq of iodine when there is an alternative milk with 0 Bq of iodine? I wonder if the Commission should perhaps consider blocking food and feed imported from Japan because it may be contaminated and instead help and support the Japanese people themselves, either financially or with uncontaminated foodstuffs. Lastly, I have an appeal to make to you Mr Barroso. I have been approached by Areva, who have travelled to Japan where their equipment had been blocked and is in storage at the airport. It is very important for you, if possible, to request the Japanese Government to release the equipment: the whole system including masks, robots and so on that has been blocked at the airport.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I fully endorse what Mrs Lepage has said and I would ask the following question: is it an opportunity or a predictable ecological disaster? We are nonetheless 10 years behind the United States in terms of exploitation. What can we see? We can see that the groundwater has been contaminated by the chemicals that have permeated this hydraulic fracturing. We can also see air pollution. We can now see that there are volatile organic compounds (VOC) and even ozone has appeared because of all the substances released into the air. We can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and, of course, the users of the phreatic nappes, because they can no longer drink the water they contain. Last week, the New York Times reported that, as well as polluting the groundwater with hydrocarbons and biocides, the contamination also emits radioactive elements. In France, as Mrs Lepage pointed out, eight licences were signed without any debate, without any consultation, without any impact assessment. And you talk of social acceptability? There is genuine rebellion. The latest demonstrations in the département of Ardèche were attended by more than 20 thousand people precisely because they care about their land. And you say, ‘It is an economic opportunity’. But whom does this gas benefit? Are we talking about cui bono
? Is it about choosing gas for the needs of industry to the detriment of the reserves of water in the phreatic nappes? The New York moratorium is a good illustration of the problem. We are therefore simply requesting that the licences be revoked. For explorations to take place while we have no guarantee of compliance with the Groundwater Framework Directive, the Air Quality Framework Directive or the Aarhus Convention is out of the question. We therefore await your responses and we will refuse, in Europe, in France and in the countries involved, to allow these non-conventional forms of gas to be exploited in the absence of these guarantees.

 Mr President, we all remember that H1N1 influenza was big news in 2009. The first cases were reported almost two years ago – on 25 March 2009 – and the WHO declared a phase 6 alert level on 11 June 2009. This maximum alert level issued by the WHO triggered a series of measures in Europe, including the activation of immunisation campaigns in several Member States which not only were very costly but were also overestimated in relation to the known severity of the virus, which, as the WHO stated at that time in May 2009, was moderate. As regards severity, up to the end of April 2010, this flu had caused around 2 900 deaths in Europe, in other words, a much lower mortality rate than that related to seasonal flu, which causes an estimated 40 000 - 220 000 deaths per year depending on the year. Meanwhile, the estimated costs were close to EUR 1.3 billion in the United Kingdom and over EUR 700 million in France according to the latest Court of Auditors report. The evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza shows that there was a disproportionate response in the European Union and the Member States. I and my colleagues, whom I would like to thank for their amendments, have therefore tried to produce a constructive report which aims to restore the confidence of European citizens in their health institutions. The report is structured around three major themes: cooperation, transparency and independence. In terms of cooperation, we are keen to stress the need for coherence, effectiveness, autonomy and flexibility. Future flu prevention plans, for example, must be revised in such a way as to guarantee greater coherence and effectiveness and must be made self-contained and flexible enough that they can be adapted in real time according to the latest available data. This kind of flexibility would have saved our public purses a good deal of unnecessary expense. At the same time, it is important to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the key players responsible for managing health risks. The definition of a pandemic itself must be revised so that it includes the concept of severity and does not just take account of geographical spread. Indeed, the WHO has informed us that it has this in hand. Group purchasing of vaccines is a possibility, provided that the manufacturers remain liable for the quality, safety and efficacy of their products. Under no circumstances must governments be made liable for side effects of vaccines that are supposed to be safe. As regards independence, the fast-track authorisation procedure has highlighted the problem of the lack of available scientific data. Research into vaccines and antiviral treatments must be conducted with complete independence from the pharmaceutical companies. In terms of transparency, total transparency is needed concerning the evaluation of drugs used for health emergencies, with full access to the clinical trials available. All declarations of interest on the part of the experts responsible for the evaluations must be made public. I have one regret: I would have preferred them to be checked by the agencies who recruit these experts, but this amendment was not adopted. Finally, I would like to highlight the cases of narcolepsy that have been reported in children in Finland and Sweden following vaccination with GSK’s H1N1 influenza vaccine. These cases need our attention. In the first instance, they clearly demonstrate that there are still grey areas, both in relation to the actual toxicity of the vaccines and adjuvants and in relation to possible risks as yet unknown to the manufacturers themselves. Finland has suspended the use of this vaccine until more information is available. This is not the position of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has decided instead to wait until more information is available before issuing any opinion on restricting the use of this vaccine. I would like to see the Commission adopt the same position as Finland. It is time that the precautionary principle benefited patients for once instead of always benefiting the companies.

Madam President, having participated in the observation mission to Haiti last September, I was able to realise the emergencies to be dealt with. Now we have to look beyond these emergencies to finally reach the development stage. We do not have to reconstruct but rather to construct a country whose foundations and governance have never been strong. One thing is clear, as my fellow Members have said: there are 20 million tonnes of rubble to clear and only 5%, a minute part, has been cleared in a year. At this rate, it will take more than six years to clear the ruins in Port-au-Prince. It is therefore a political project in itself and the Commission has to contribute to it. Another priority is governance and I am pleased that the European Union is making a major contribution to budgetary support for the country. We have to increase this financial effort because it is the only means of restoring competences to the Haitian country and people. Its current dependency on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is seen at the level of basic public services such as health and education. We must not, however, subcontract all public services to NGOs. Above all, we have to increase our support to organise elections quickly and complete these elections, which, I hope, should enable a corrupt political elite to be replaced. At present, an oligarchy of allegedly 20 families prevents any economic development because it controls trade but, at the same time, does nothing to develop the country’s production capacity. Finally, we have to give Haiti the resources to emerge from the dependency that was already undermining it even before the earthquake. Therefore, I call upon European institutions to establish consistent priorities and to give massive support to setting up public services with strong commitment from the future Haitian Government.

Mr President, on the subject of this text that we voted for, I would like to draw your attention – and I must congratulate Mrs McAvan for the quality of her work – to an omission regarding guinea pig populations. In fact, there is one point that has been neglected, which, on account of the agreement concluded in first reading, could not be the subject of an oral amendment: it is a question of people used as guinea pigs for clinical tests of a medicine or vaccine conducted before authorisation in order to check its harmlessness or its risk-benefit balance. These people may include men, women, children or elderly people; in this text, we are concerned with the follow-up of the possible side-effects of drugs for human use. In fact, it must be pointed out that these people who participate in clinical tests are kept in ignorance as regards the substance ingested or injected and that the effects are only likely to be triggered ten, twenty or thirty years later. These guinea pigs are the forgotten people of pharmacovigilance and it is important to remember this and mention it. Michèle Rivasi,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

Mr President, I am going to take one minute and I shall speak for a further minute afterwards. I should like to speak first as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, for this report. I should like to say that it is very important in this sector to provide patients with better protection and better information, but also to fight against the stranglehold exerted by the pharmaceutical industry, which wanted to collect reports of side effects and to analyse and interpret the results. At the level of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – and, moreover, at the level of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – we therefore succeeding in ensuring that, when it comes to the collection of reports, doctors and patients will be the ones able to report side effects for transmission to the national authorities. As far as analysis and interpretation are concerned, the Member States are responsible for detecting and monitoring the adverse reactions of medicinal products. It transpired, in connection with the outbreak of H1N1 influenza, that it was the Swedish national authorities which referred to narcolepsy even though, until now, the H1N1 vaccine had not been associated with such side effects. This is very important. On the other hand, I am very disappointed that we have not achieved financial independence from the national authorities. Finally, as far as controls are concerned, there has been real progress in relation to this Pharmacovigilance Committee, which is separate from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and I hope that there will also be more information available for patients, either on package leaflets or in terms of ultra-vigilance.

Mr President, I would like to come back to the environmental impact of medicinal products. Since 1965, Europe has established criteria for obtaining marketing authorisations. There are three criteria, namely efficacy, safety and the pharmaceutical quality of the medicinal product, but there is nothing about the environmental impact of medicinal products. As you know, the oestrogen found in river waters is changing the sex of fish. As you also know, there are high levels of residues of medicinal products in purification plants and in waste water from hospitals. There has been a fair amount of discussion on this matter; a debate has been held and, in the Pharmacovigilance Directive, it has finally been taken into account in the form of a recital calling on the Commission to publish a report, on the basis of data provided by the European Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Member States, on the scale of the problem and an assessment of whether or not it would be appropriate or useful to amend EU legislation on medicinal products or in other areas. What I want of the Commission is a proper report based on these data, because this indirectly affects human health in that, in numerous cases, it is the consumption of water that caused the side effects identified.

Mr President, I consider that progress has been made in this text, including on two fundamental aspects: the need for labelling if nanoparticles are present in a product and, more importantly, the fact that each of these nanosubstances will also be subject to separate evaluation, which is not currently the case. Progress has also been made in terms of the possibility of excluding endocrine disrupters from substances used, with specific and properly applicable exclusion criteria. But – there is a but – we disagree on the actual resources for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), because that agency’s mission should be to evaluate and authorise biocidal products. However, we have just extended the ECHA’s mission; we agree with that, but extending it means giving the ECHA the resources to really do its job. We cannot ask the ECHA to do a lot more work, to reduce substance evaluation times, while, at the same time, reducing its resources. If we do so, we risk coming up against simplified assessments, which may well be fast, but which will be superficial and therefore inadequate. That is why I call on you, Mrs Klaß, to reconsider your budgetary proposal concerning the ECHA missions in this dossier. As it stands, I must say that your proposal is not a serious one, and this will affect the standard of work of that European institution, which is essential to the safety of European citizens and consumers. This is an important issue. You cannot demand more if the resources are not available, or else the ECHA will just be an administrative agency which responds to the industrial lobby.

 Mr President, I would like to make the connection between the scanner, health and terrorism. What does the Interagency Committee on Radioprotection, which brings together the European Commission, the IAEA – the International Atomic Energy Agency – and the Nuclear Energy Agency say? It says that pregnant women and children must not be subjected to body scans, even if the doses are extremely small. Indeed, we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations. My question therefore concerns justification of the risks. Given the existence of alternative technologies that enable the same goals to be achieved, these scanners really do need to be justified in relation to the given objective, and we need to know … (The President cut off the speaker) Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, for my part, would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine. Currently, the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation, and I would like to share a number of concerns with you. Firstly, what is the relationship between the risks and benefits? At the moment, the benefits are few, since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths – nowhere near as many as seasonal flu, in any case. With regard to the risks, on the other hand, we have enough time to consider this aspect, and I would like, in particular, to address the problem of adjuvants. I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd: in the United States, the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited, but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene. The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype. I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, the current situation of migrants is a legacy of the past. With this motion for a resolution, we wish to galvanise the new Libyan Government to action with regard to migrants’ rights and to make clear that we would like very much and are prepared to assist it in establishing new policies towards migrants and asylum seekers, as this is a crucial issue. Non-governmental organisations working in Libya have reported numerous human rights violations, including sexual violence towards children and women.  Finally, in order to ensure better protection of migrants’ rights, it is vital that Libya, which has successfully started out on the path to democracy, should draw a line under the past and the legacy of the dictatorship by ratifying international conventions, including, of course, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the political message of this report, which calls on the European Union to make signature of the EU-Kazakhstan enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement dependent on progress on democracy, respect for human rights and freedom of the press. I condemn the decision of the Appellate Court in Aktau to sentence the opposition politician Vladimir Kozlov to seven and a half years in prison. His trial, monitored closely by the international community, has been described as staged, as a ‘Soviet-style’ trial. There is absolutely no concrete evidence against Mr Kozlov. He is accused of having spoken out against his country when abroad, in particular in his speeches in the European Parliament. It is unacceptable for opponents and defenders of human rights invited to Parliament to be at risk once they return home and even imprisoned. That calls into question the very credibility of this House. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, if this new generation is not given pens, they will be given guns by terrorists. Those are the words of Malala, who, at the age of 14, understands fully that educating children and combating obscurantism go hand in hand. Besides the case of this young Pakistani girl, who has become a symbol, I would remind you that young girls in Afghanistan have to deal with this unacceptable situation every day. The extensive violence to which they are subjected no longer makes the headlines, as it did 10 years ago, when we wanted to justify our military action in Afghanistan on the grounds of emancipating Afghan women. I must therefore repeat it again: we cannot forget them. That is the message that the Afghan parliamentarians wanted to get across when they visited the European Parliament a few weeks ago. They fear that in 2014, after the ISAF forces withdraw, the rights they have obtained over this last decade will quite simply be exchanged for a return to calm during the negotiations between the Afghan Government and the Taliban. For that reason, we must continue to condemn tirelessly these archaic practices. Above all, however, the European Union must provide financial support for the local women’s associations who are fighting to keep the schools open. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask you if you are aware of the reports of the European Union’s ambassadors and delegations in Jerusalem, which have stated clearly in recent years that we cannot guarantee the traceability of products from Israel and thus identify and distinguish products from the settlements. I would like to know if you are aware of these reports because I am astonished that you say that products from the settlements are not involved. In addition, have you also heard that in many countries, and mine in particular, consumers regularly spot products from the settlements on our markets? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not a simple technical agreement. It means stronger EU-Israeli relations and free access to Europe’s single market even though the EU decided in 2009 to suspend the upgrading of its economic relations with Israel. Supporting this agreement means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal settlement of the Palestinian territories; it means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza. The reports by our ambassadors in Jerusalem recommend that we adopt binding measures to put an end to the settlements. The European Union has stated that the Israeli settlement policy is an obstacle to peace so, for the sake of consistency, if we adopt the ACAA we should refuse the Nobel Peace Prize.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that we should condemn such a blatant violation of human rights and such an outburst of violence, which serve as a reminder for South Africa of the darkest days of its history. I want to highlight the fact that today, South Africa, which is often lauded as a model of democracy, has an opportunity to show us that it is capable of applying the fundamental principles of this democracy, namely, impartial justice and respect for the rule of law. I am therefore pleased that a committee of inquiry has been established in order to shed light on the tragic events of 16 August, but it seems to me that it is essential that we also condemn the use of common purpose law, a throwback to apartheid, which has only served to crystallise the anger in the country a little more. In South Africa, as in many African states, the wealth of mineral resources is in stark contrast to the rising poverty of part of the population. This part of the population, which is crying out for change, with the fall of the apartheid regime, is, on the contrary, seeing growing social inequalities and a new economic apartheid take root. The sharing of natural resources remains a key issue on the African continent, and multinationals must shoulder their responsibilities in the current conflicts. That is why Europe must promote another kind of economic and human development in these regions, by stopping imports of mining products extracted without social or environmental guarantees. In conclusion, I would add that this situation should give us cause to reflect, because in South Africa, as in other countries around the world, democracy does not simply mean free elections, but also more social justice.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on this excellent result. The compromise reached between the institutions paves the way for real progress on uniting the European continent to help particularly vulnerable people who are the victims of crime. This directive will reinforce a series of measures implemented at European level to promote the free movement and the defence of victims of crime, such as the European protection order. We can welcome the result of this trialogue, for example, the definition of gender-based violence, even though it only appears in the recitals rather than the articles. We must also welcome the fact that all victims have been included, regardless of their status, particularly their residence status. From now on, the most vulnerable people will have the right, in European territory, to protection and consideration of their needs. The text recognises the impact of crime, not only on the victim, but also on close family members, including children. Despite these advances, I would like to underline the need to consider violence against women as a social phenomenon as such and, like a number of my colleagues, I call on the Commission to prepare a specific directive on this issue.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution on EU policy on the occupied Palestinian territories. This text provides a comprehensive account of reality on the ground and openly denounces the rampant expansion of Israeli settlements, the extremism of the settlers, the expulsions and the demolition of Palestinian houses. I welcome the fact that Parliament unequivocally calls on the Israeli authorities to end the expansion of the settlements and once again reiterates the official position of the European Union, which is that Europe will not recognise any unilateral change to the borders of the future state of Palestine. I regret, however, that this resolution lacks ambition. Parliament does not openly recognise that the existing control mechanism – the 2005 technical agreement concluded by the Commission with the Israeli authorities – has never been effectively implemented and that products from the Israeli settlements continue to be imported into the European market labelled ‘made in Israel’. Instead of calling on the Commission to create a new legally binding control mechanism, Parliament is content to request that the Union’s existing legislation be implemented.

 Mr President, the issue of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Africa keeps appearing on the parliamentary agenda, and with good reason. Two thirds of African countries have repressive laws in this area and, as has already been mentioned, South Africa is currently regressing on this issue. Today, I would like to talk to you about the documentary made in Uganda by two women on the situation of LGBT people. During filming, in 2010, David Kato, an iconic figure in the fight of LGBTs in Africa, was assassinated. This documentary then changed dimension, and the message of tolerance and hope it bears must be disseminated as widely as possible. I would therefore like to invite you to see this film, which is entitled Call me Kuchu
, and to encourage its distribution in all Member States to let them know of the fate of the Kuchus and to not let silence make them disappear. I will leave you with this phrase spoken by David Kato: ‘They keep saying we do not exist, but we definitely do’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that in several Member States, including France, it is consumer associations and human rights organisations which carry out controls on the origin of products labelled ‘Made in Israel’, and these groups regularly denounce the presence on our markets of products originating in illegal settlements. It is not a rare occurrence. In a spirit of ethical consumption, civil society therefore tries to ensure the traceability of products imported from Israel, as the European Union has shown that it is incapable of implementing the 2005 technical agreement in accordance with international law. You will understand that I am very sceptical and dubious that you will give us guarantees, as you should, on legally binding provisions ensuring that no more products from the settlements are entering the European market. I should like to point out that, with regard to medicines, the children of Gaza not only do not have medicines, but do not even have access to drinking water or enough food to sustain themselves. I think it is important to keep in mind the global context, which, from a humanitarian and human rights point of view, is a dramatic context, and we cannot content ourselves with simply talking about trade without talking about that.

Mr President, the Sahel region, which has already been severely affected by climate change and weakened by the presence of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), has been destabilised by the war in Libya and the return of heavily armed mercenaries. The risk of a merger between certain Islamist groups and the Tuareg rebellion are concerning but should force us to understand the reasons behind them. The financial austerity policies that have been imposed in Africa for 30 years by international institutions, external interference and the exploitation of natural resources have led to impoverishment. In Mali, the population has barely seen the positive social and economic effects that should have come about through gold production. Mali is the third largest producer of gold in Africa. The Malian mining code does not provide for any restriction on mining companies in terms of environmental and social responsibility. This weakness in the legislation makes Mali extremely attractive. Now uranium is being coveted by a French company, which is drilling and working with absolutely no regard for the population and the environment, causing many inhabitants of the Faléa commune to protest. In Niger, France has been exploiting uranium for 40 years and the situation of the local population has not improved at all. On 25 April, the staff of the Imouraren site initiated a strike to protest against disastrous working conditions, claiming that they were working 12 hours a day. In Niger, 60% of exports rely on uranium, and the country provides close to 40% of the stock for Areva, which plans to develop what will be the second largest uranium mine in the world. Niger is classed as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of the human development index. The local population is mainly Tuareg and has long suffered the almost irreversible health consequences of this irresponsible exploitation: air pollution and contamination of the region’s scarce water resources. In conclusion, Europe must therefore promote further economic and human development in this region. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Vlasák, thank you for that question. I entirely agree with you. That is exactly what I intend to do, what at any rate my political organisation Europe Ecology-The Greens (EELV) is already beginning to do in France: to put pressure on this government so that we change our relationships with Africa in general and, more specifically, with Mali – since this is what we are currently discussing – and Niger.

Madam President, let me tell you about my personal experience in this regard. In the context of decentralised cooperation, I had the opportunity to work with associations in Africa and came face to face with the reality of female genital mutilation, about which Ms De Keyser has just spoken. Our resolution stresses the importance of relying on local authorities and NGOs. Taking into account the realities on the ground is essential in the fight against these practices. For example, in any programme to combat female genital mutilation, it must be borne in mind that, for the women who practise it, it is a professional activity. It is sometimes their only source of income, and I know from experience that many of these women are more than willing to abandon the practice if they are offered reintegration into the labour market. I particularly wanted to share this testimony with you, as it is my personal experience. I would also like to stress the exemplary value of the delegations we send to third countries, which must ensure equal representation, as this is the best way of advancing the cause of gender equality.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, if the NATO summit officially records a decision to pull out of Afghanistan, it might as well be officially recording the defeat of the West. If we were to compare the statements made by NATO and the Council with information coming from Afghan civil society and the NGOs, you would think that they were talking about two different countries: the resurgence of the Taliban, who are champing at the bit to stamp their authority on the entire country and take their revenge on those who collaborated with the West. I refer of course to women, and I remember how, in 2001, the plight of Afghan women was exploited to justify a military intervention that the population had not asked for. After the bombings and destruction, they were promised reconstruction, peace and democracy. They have failed. According to the Minister, Mr Eftekhari, 6 million children are suffering from extreme poverty, abuse and violence. Under pressure from the Taliban, schools have been burned, teachers threatened and killed. Nearly 550 girls’ schools have closed their doors in 11 provinces. Young people flee the country to come to the West, the land of promise. There is no point dwelling on the reception or rather the lack of reception waiting for them in Europe: we should be ashamed of ourselves. In addition, Pakistan and Iran have decided to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from their countries. Given the EU’s commitment to the Afghan people, are we prepared, Baroness Ashton, at Council level and in the European External Action Service (EEAS), to adopt a plan to help and take in these refugees? Will we welcome and support the threatened teachers, the women’s rights activists, all those who have put their trust in us and who have to choose … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues and to express my gratitude for the very interesting contributions I have received for this report which, I hope, will be the start of a growing awareness on the part of our institutions. In an ideal Parliament, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality would not exist and issues relating to gender and discrimination against women would be spontaneously integrated into all the matters we deal with here, because this is a cross-cutting issue. However, it is necessary to continue to drive the point home without any let-up because we Members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have a responsibility to remove women from the blind spot of European policies. This is particularly true of environmental issues. I would even go so far as to say that we will show in our report that women are not the green plants of ecology. The figures are staggering. Women are 14 times more likely to die during cyclones, floods and earthquakes. In the tsunami that affected Asia in 2004, for example, and also in the heat wave that hit Europe in 2003, 70% of the victims were women. Why? Women do not have the same resources – economic, social or political – to adapt or even to flee. On the other hand, in Honduras, thanks to a warning and disaster management system which included women from the outset, La Masica was the only town not to record a single death during and after hurricane Mitch. Climate change remains an absolute priority but, in a context of economic crisis, ecology is not the only thing to regress. Women’s rights, too, are eroded and it is by linking the two that we are proposing a coherent political vision and effective solutions. In the past, whenever there was a crisis, whenever there was revolution, we were told that women’s rights would come afterwards. This line of reasoning is out of date and unsound. The challenges of climate change and that of justice and equality for women are intrinsically linked. Women are not only victims to be protected. Women also have knowledge and proposals to make: not because they are, of course, different, but because we live in a society where roles are often gendered. Being a woman or a man has an impact on our daily lives, from the management of resources and access to education to the choice of occupation. These differences in experience are reflected in the solutions and ideas proposed. In the report, we have identified four types of measures. Firstly, measures of representation. We are calling for women’s representation of at least 40% in political, financial and technical bodies. The voice of women and their organisations must be heard and supported. Secondly, measures concerning protection and training, establishing a virtuous cycle for women, from victims to agents of change. Thirdly, measures of education, not only to open up the future green economy and encourage women to pursue scientific and technical careers, but also to support the necessary changes in lifestyle patterns. Finally, as regards research, we need data disaggregated by sex to be collected to improve our understanding of the subject and our policy proposals. To summarise the spirit of this report, we maintain that policies to combat climate change can be enriched through the integration of gender issues and that combating discrimination generates solutions that are more effective for the environment. It is a win-win line of reasoning. As we approach the Rio+20 Summit, it is clear that there are no simple solutions to a challenge as complex and pressing as climate change. It is by broadening our way of thinking that we will find the resources to make a significant change for the better. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I knew, after meeting Commissioner Hedegaard at a hearing organised by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, that we could count on her and on the Commission. I also know that we can count on the Danish Presidency having, in fact, heard a number of proposals. I would like to thank all my colleagues, men and women, who have spoken here today, because what they have said has simply reflected the work we have done collectively, which is very enriching for us all. I think this debate was necessary, and that we must, of course, continue to raise awareness. Each one of us here has contributed to this report and I am very satisfied. I know that we can also rely on the Institute for Gender Equality, which we created in Vilnius in 2011. I should nonetheless like to say something. I would like to pay tribute to all the women and women’s associations worldwide who have long understood that something had to be done about preserving resources and about climate issues. In some countries, women have known this for a long time. In this regard, I will mention India, where, within the Chipko movement, women attached themselves to trees to save them; Rwanda too, where women have preserved 600 kinds of beans. I would also like to pay homage to Wangari Maathai, whom no one here will have forgotten, who left us recently and who, with her Green Belt movement, preserved millions of trees. Women in developing countries recognised the need to take action a long time ago and we know we can count on them. A final point, which has been raised several times, is the issue of quotas. My political group and I, personally, are very much in favour of this tool. It is only a tool, per se
, but it has enabled us to become the only political group with equal representation in this Parliament. I believe it is the only way, unfortunately, to move things forward. If we do not use this tool of allocating quotas, we will not succeed in advancing gender equality. It is simply a tool. Finally, if you will permit me, I shall quote Einstein, who said, ‘Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, it is true that Kazakhstan is the most open country in Central Asia, economically speaking. European investments are welcome there and companies such as Total, Eni, Areva and Alstom have operations there with major interests. It is also true that Europe is hoping to use this country as a route to transport its troops and military equipment out of Afghanistan. In view of its interests, Europe is remaining discreet and pragmatic towards the Kazakh authorities. However, are we not being too pragmatic at the risk of repeating the same mistakes we made with the Arab world? Moreover, that is what civil society in Kazakhstan, and in the former Soviet Union in general, is convinced that we are doing. We must therefore be attentive to what is actually happening in Kazakhstan. By freeing Ms Sokolova, the lawyer for the trade unionists, and Mr Zhovtis, the human rights defender, the Kazakh authorities are showing proof of goodwill. However, growing and continuing repression of the political opposition, the trade unionists and the independent media persists. Forty-three strikers in Zhanaozen are being threatened with long prison sentences, as are nine members of the opposition, Mr Kozlov, Mr Viniavski and Ms Amirova. We have seen unbelievable censorship of the electronic media to silence all alternative sources of information. Following the orders of the presidential Security Council, 125 websites, judged to be dangerous, have already been blocked, with 168 others on a blacklist. A series of recently promulgated laws tracks this regression in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan: laws on audio-visual material, the Internet and information and a law on religious communities. Although the Kazakh authorities are telling us that they learned their lesson from the tragedy in Zhanaozen, they have just promulgated a law on national security which severely limits freedom of expression and the freedom to change the labour code, which restricts the rights of workers. Are we going to, once again, content ourselves with verbal promises from the Kazakh authorities and continue with business as usual or are we going to openly say to our Kazakh partners that the repression of dissident voices cannot ensure long-term stability? The European Union will, in any case, have to commit to daily monitoring of the upcoming trials of the various strikers and opponents and ensure that the legislative reforms guarantee fundamental freedoms. All of these developments should determine our position on upgrading the partnership with Kazakhstan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, in addressing the issue of quotas, Ms Reding has brought up an old debate on the legitimacy of binding legislative measures. As far as I am concerned, I am fully in favour of proactive, binding measures on the issue that we are considering today, since it is plain that matters are not progressing at all. At university, it has been said that at the top colleges there are brilliant female students who have far higher qualifications than their male colleagues. However, as soon as students enter the world of work, it is clear that difficulties arise and that women are not managing to break through the notorious glass ceiling. At European Union level, we cannot continue to do without the skills of half of the population, once referred to as ‘half of heaven’. What I would like to say to you is that I belong to a political organisation which enshrined equality in its own rules in 1984 in France, and that we have obtained brilliant results. We have had the first female regional president in France. We have had female candidates for the presidential elections. Currently in this Parliament, I am one of eight women elected out of a total of 15 MEPs, making more women than men. I therefore believe that when a decision is taken to move things forward, all that is needed is to take measures such as these in order to achieve equality. I am 100% in favour of these binding measures because parity seems vital to me. This is, quite simply, a question of justice. It is not a question of quotas. I believe that we must talk of parity, and not of quotas. Quotas are 30-40%; they are not justice. Justice is 50:50. I believe that we absolutely must achieve that. Madam President, I would like to propose to you that we should be setting an example, particularly in respect of the Member States; why should we not introduce parity in Parliament’s executive Bureau, from the next term? I think it would be important to start with that step. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to talk to you about Kazakhstan. Did you know that the massive oil workers’ strike which began last May in the province of Mangistau has resulted in brutal repression and the arrest of trade unionists and their lawyer? On 16 December, a peaceful protest at Zhanaozen ended in bloodshed. There were many injuries, at least 15 deaths, as well as arrests and incidents of mistreatment, torture and rape. The legislative elections of 15 January were deemed neither free nor democratic by observers. Finally, human rights defenders and militants from opposition parties recently invited to give their views before the Members of our Parliament were arrested upon their return and are facing long prison sentences. Faced with this authoritarian and repressive abuse, the European Union’s silence is unacceptable. How do you intend to react, Baroness Ashton, to what I have just told you? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Baroness Ashton stated that human rights should henceforth run as a silver thread throughout all of our external actions. The European Union is one of the main trading partners of Uzbekistan and a major importer of cotton. In view of conditions during the cotton harvest, Parliament is duty-bound to shoulder its moral responsibility and refuse to consent to this agreement as long as Uzbekistan continues to deny access to the independent mission of the International Labour Organisation, and until that mission confirms that reforms have been implemented, bringing an end to forced child labour. For the first time ever, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament can use its new powers and refuse to ratify a trade agreement in the name of human rights. Our action is therefore consistent with the values we defend, and conforms to what is being demanded by NGOs, trade unions and textile retailers’ groups, who are calling for ethical production. The ball is now in the Commission’s court, and it should withdraw the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for Uzbekistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, a great deal has been achieved in the four years since we implemented the EU strategy for Central Asia. The Union has established a continuous political dialogue and regular dialogues on human rights. Initiatives and important programmes have been activated in support of the EU’s seven priority areas. However, in light of the Arab Spring, and in the context of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan, which is already under way, bearing in mind the tragic events of southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, the limitations of our strategy are much more visible today, and this requires a major re-assessment on our part. The strategy is due to be reviewed by the European External Action Service in 2012, and we therefore considered that some key recommendations should be set out in the report, based on the following observation: the EU is unable to reconcile its values and interests in effective programmes that are adapted to the realities and developments in the region. Europe lacks visibility there. Its presence is still in its early stages. The funding devoted to the strategy is modest and would even appear to be under threat. We do not give sufficient open support to civil society, independent media or human rights defenders. Sometimes, in fact, it is pro-government foundations that benefit from European financial support, much to the frustration of genuine NGOs. In the light of this situation, the European Parliament is convinced that it should develop a new EU approach based on human security and regional cooperation. All our actions, projects and initiatives should follow the guiding principle of promoting human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Europe and its Western partners, who are bogged down in the quagmire of Afghanistan and concerned about their military bases in the region, have, for too long, given priority to the stability of the regimes in place rather than human rights. However, stability based on repression does not last long, and the Arab Spring is proof of that. We should be careful not to make the same mistakes twice, and we must be capable of better responding to the political vacuum that a similar change could trigger in Central Asia, in a context of ethnic and regional conflicts. In Kazakhstan, trade unions in the oil sector have been on strike for more than six months despite merciless repression. Early legislative elections will be held on 15 January 2012, against a backdrop of unprecedented social tension and the banning of political parties. Will we have the courage and honesty to tell the Kazhak Government that the EU will draw the appropriate conclusions from these events during negotiations on future partnership and cooperation agreements? We are alarmed by the Human Rights Watch report published yesterday on the indescribably cruel torture that is carried out in Uzbekistan prisons. In Tashkent, human rights defenders have just been arrested. We were happy to hear Baroness Ashton, in Parliament, insisting that human rights should henceforth form the backbone of all of our external action. We therefore recommend carrying out a review of our strategy for Central Asia. I am especially proud of the fact that Parliament has put conditionality and the principles of differentiation and ‘more for more’ at the heart of its new approach, while recommending that we should enhance our support for civil society and independent media organisations. The EU cannot be honest in one part of the world while failing to respond to violations of its values in another. Lastly, we should consider regional cooperation. The challenges these countries are facing call for a concerted approach: ethnic conflicts, water resource management, security problems, circulation of arms and trafficking of drugs and people. These threats directly affect the security and stability of Central Asia, and also of Europe. We therefore recommend that the EU should play the role of mediator and facilitator. In order to promote dialogue between these countries, we recommend establishing an ad hoc
 parliamentary forum, which the EU, through the European Parliament delegation, could propose to the parliaments of the five Central Asian countries. MEPs would thus be able to share their experience and expertise while meeting with their counterparts. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuation of the Israeli colonisation in Palestine has brought the peace talks to a standstill and has led the Palestinians to demand their accession to the UN, now that they have put in place credible political and economic institutions. Europe is dithering at a time when it should be adopting an independent position and asserting itself as a player on the international stage. According to a very recent poll, the majority of French, German and British citizens think that the Palestinians have the right to a State that should be recognised by the UN immediately. The fact is, we represent the citizens of Europe. The democratic awakening of the Arab world creates a new context which is likely to relaunch the peace process. The aspirations of young people are the same in Tunis, Cairo, Ramallah and Gaza. If we abandon the Palestinians, despair could lead to a new intifada, for which we would be responsible. It is in fact a historic opportunity that is being presented to the European Union. It should include the recognition of this Palestinian state in its policy of support for the Arab Spring, instead of exerting pressure on the Palestinian Authority to force it to abandon its claim to fully fledged statehood at the UN, and instead of working on the Israeli Government so that it finally agrees to respect international law.

 Mr President, I raised my blue card earlier on, but you did not see it. For I could have already asked Mr Provera the question I am asking Ms Ries, since they both used the same term –‘unilateral’ – several times. I would like them to explain what they mean by that and to also tell me how they define the building by Israel of hundreds of kilometres of wall and hundreds upon hundreds of houses in the settlements. I would like them to tell me how they can talk about unilateralism when we know that this initiative of recognising a Palestinian state is supported by 130 or 140 countries. I confess that I need the word to be defined for me. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance once again deplores the conditions under which Mr Rajoelina came to power in Madagascar. The political situation of that country, which is very unstable, is extremely worrying. There have been numerous human rights violations: violence against demonstrators, illegal arrests, arbitrary detentions, as well as abuses against journalists and political opponents. The security forces enjoy total impunity. Leaders of opposition political movements have been imprisoned. We are demanding their release. In addition, the uncontrolled management of the country’s natural resources threatens prospects for development for future generations and paves the way for an ecological disaster. We condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pillaging of precious wood, particularly rosewood. The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and foremost, the European Union. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, these assassinations are, of course, intolerable, but what is more intolerable is the climate of impunity that exists, despite the increase in attacks. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors. Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws. The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally. According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system. The European Union must therefore use all the necessary instruments at its disposal to strengthen judicial cooperation with Pakistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have observed a strange tendency within the European Union: despite statements criticising Israel’s human rights violations, the Member States and the Commission are working tirelessly to strengthen political and economic relations with Israel, with no conditions attached. On 22 February, the Union actually upgraded its association agreement with Israel, promising to step up cooperation in several apparently technical agreements in various areas: competition, access to public contracts, Israel’s integration into the European Research Area and into European agencies such as Europol, the European Space Agency and so on. On 31 January, the Commission authorised the transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to Israel, a country suspected of having used EU citizens’ passports to carry out an extrajudicial killing in Dubai last year. Israel, which already participates in more than 800 projects with European universities and businesses, will receive more than EUR 500 million in subsidies in 2013. Among the beneficiaries will be the arms manufacturers Elbit and Israel Aerospace Industries, which manufacture the drones and aircraft used against the people of Gaza. At the Association Council, the European Union welcomed the new measures announced by Mr Netanyahu for Gaza and the West Bank. Baroness Ashton, please could you indicate what this facilitation measure consists of when hundreds of lorry drivers are protesting in Gaza as we speak to denounce the closure of the Karni crossing? Also, how does Mr Netanyahu propose to stop the rapid colonisation of Jerusalem and the West Bank? I would be grateful, Baroness Ashton, if you could send a message of encouragement and a true message of hope to all those women who took to the streets in Palestine yesterday and who are expecting a great deal of the European Union. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the massacres inflicted on the Coptic Christians in Alexandria provoked international outrage. The Eastern Christians’ situation as a whole is worrying: in Iraq, in Lebanon and even in Palestine, where Christians are leaving what they see as their Holy Land, worn down by the humiliation they have suffered under Israeli occupation. I am glad that our resolution on freedom of religion gives the subject a broad interpretation and recalls the fundamental rights: the right to believe and not to believe; the right to choose a religion without being discriminated against. Whilst our text quite rightly mentions the recent attacks and killings that have gone on in the world, we must also admit that in some European countries, respect for this freedom of religion is under threat. We often witness acts of intolerance: the profaning of Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic talk. Actions such as Switzerland’s vote to ban the construction of minarets and the rise of extremist parties who express intolerant views against certain communities are all signs that we must make the fight to uphold secular principles a priority in Europe. Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and ethnic and religious minorities are all facing a worrying increase in violations of their universal fundamental rights. Europe ought to set an example on tolerance and intercommunity dialogue. Eastern Christians are increasingly suspected of representing the interests and causes of the West, while Muslims in Europe are associated with radical Islam and terrorism. Let me read you if I may two lines of a poem by Louis Aragon: ‘Celui qui croyait au ciel, celui qui n'y croyait pas, et leur sang rouge ruisselle, même couleur, même éclat
’ (‘The one who believed in God and the one who did not, their blood runs equally red and equally bright’). Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Mrs Ashton, may I take this opportunity to thank Mr Arlacchi for the constructive atmosphere in which we have worked. This report offers a very honest, very fair analysis of the shortcomings in the international intervention in Afghanistan since 2001. We approve its key message: there will be no military solution. The war is having a huge cost. The war is costing human lives both amongst the soldiers and the population and it only serves to strengthen the Taliban. The only solution is a political one. What the Afghans are waiting for is real investment in their country’s development, in support for good governance, in the creation of a judicial system. The problem of fundamental rights, most importantly women’s rights, remains intact. The very recent report of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan demonstrates the inability of the Afghan Government to fully safeguard the rights of women and girls. I quote: ‘As long as women and girls are subject to practices that harm them, degrade them and deprive them of their rights, little significant or lasting progress can be made in Afghanistan’. In order to safeguard the rights of Afghan women, not only do we need written legal and constitutional guarantees, but more importantly their rapid and appropriate application. The National Assembly has little influence in the country, the bulk of the power being concentrated in the hands of President Karzai. If it is not too late, unfailing support, to strengthen democracy and the state of law, must come from the European Union to the various institutions and, in particular, to the parliament that has just been elected. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, on 8 November, the Moroccan authorities used violence in dismantling the camp set up near Laâyoune, in Western Sahara, resulting in deaths and numerous injuries. I am absolutely outraged that a Member State, in this instance France, should object to the request for a UN fact-finding mission looking into these events. Uganda’s proposal at the UN Security Council meeting on 16 November was however both legitimate and desirable. It is all very well for France to hide behind the lack of decision on the part of the Security Council when it has abused its weight of veto power to prevent any light being shed on these incidents. Would the truth be so hard to face? Europe, which likes to think itself exemplary in protecting human rights, must demand an independent and transparent fact-finding mission, under the aegis of the United Nations, and an extended mandate for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). More generally, we are counting on Baroness Ashton for a fair and lasting solution to be brought to this unacceptable situation for the Sahrawi people. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the Commission wrote in 2005 that, ‘individual expulsion decisions [taken by Member States’ competent authorities] have to comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention, the 1967 Protocol and international treaties. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The fact is, serious human rights violations do take place in Pakistan: the death penalty, torture, death while in custody, forced disappearances, honour crimes. As has already been said, there are several international agreements that it has not signed. How can we be sure that the rights of readmitted individuals and their safety will be protected? There are no guarantees for ethnic or religious minorities or for women. There is no mention of the consequences of the agreement for Afghan refugees, nor are there any plans for the implementation of the agreement to be monitored by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights. In the name of human rights and human dignity, Parliament must reject this agreement. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some people are saying that today’s debate is no longer topical. However, while pressure groups have been attacking European funding for Israeli NGOs since 2005, the working conditions of civil society in Israel continue to deteriorate. Since the publication of the Goldstone report, many representatives of organisations have been defamed, intimidated and arrested. Fourteen draft bills are currently under discussion. They all have the aim of restricting independence and freedom of association. I would remind you that Israeli defenders of human rights are no longer allowed to enter the occupied territories without a permit from the army. Israeli democrats and pacifists, who have been able to benefit from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, are concerned, because even in an amended form, this draft bill specifically targets the financing of international organisations while private funding is not affected. We will no longer accept that those people who have the courage to denounce the daily humiliations suffered by Palestinians, the expulsion of families, demolition of houses, land confiscation and water deprivation, should be reduced to silence.

Mr President, I would simply like to ask Mrs Ries, since she does not think there has been any impact on the Knesset or on the Israeli authorities, to explain the communiqué from the Israeli Embassy which we were just talking about and to explain certain e-mails we have received over the past few days. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to start by paying tribute to the coalition of ecologists that we welcomed some months ago in Brussels, an association of Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians. It drew up some excellent reports on the situation in the region, on the state of the Jordan River, and on the risk of its disappearance. The European Union, which allocates substantial funds to development projects in the Middle East, must play more of a role in drafting and implementing a rescue plan for the river involving all parties in the region. The countries bordering the river, such as Syria, Jordan and Israel, divert the greatest part of it, while the Palestinians – as someone just said – receive only around 5% of the resource. In the Jordan Valley, the Israeli settlers consume six times more water than the Palestinians, particularly through the polluting intensive agriculture intended for the export of agricultural products to Europe. The extension of these settlements with their lush vegetation must stop, as must the destruction of Bedouin camps and their water tanks, which happened again this summer, some weeks ago. It is madness! The preservation and fair distribution of water in the region must be a priority for us. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, the case of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, which obviously brings us together this evening, and which has mobilised many citizens in Europe, should also provide us with an opportunity to discuss the situation of a number of women. I am thinking in particular of Zahra Bahrami, who is in the same situation. She is in danger of being executed following a trial that took place in similar conditions, that is to say, that she was subjected to pressure, isolation – total isolation – for several months, violence and torture in order to make confessions that subsequently, of course, are no longer recognised. The accusations are similar: waging war against God. She does not have access to either a lawyer or a defence counsel. There is also the case mentioned just now of the young man, Ebrahim Hamidi, a minor who also has no lawyer, and the case of Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist and human rights defender. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience, and she is currently locked up in a cage in which she cannot move her arms or legs. She is also threatened with death. I believe that it is to the credit of our Parliament that it is rallying in support of Mrs Mohammadi-Ashtiani’s case and of all these situations. We demand the abolition of the death penalty, a moratorium on all these executions, the immediate release of all those who have taken part in peaceful protests and, of course, the release of minors, because many minors are also sentenced to death in that country. We also urgently call for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit the prisoners. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Mrs Parvanova’s report on the social integration of women belonging to ethnic minority groups comes at just the right time, when the French Government is embarking on a huge operation to expel Roma men, women and children – the most disadvantaged and most discriminated-against citizens of Europe. Roma women are the victims of double discrimination because of their origin and their gender. They are discriminated against with regard to the exercise of the fundamental rights that are the right to education, to employment and to healthcare. The violence they suffer as women constitutes another form of discrimination. We must demand that all Member States respect the fundamental rights of the largest ethnic minority in Europe and, first and foremost, of these women. Forced labour, trafficking, forced sterilisation, child marriage and countless abortions characterise the lives of these women, and hounding them from town to town, moving them from one end of Europe to the other, will not improve their situation. It is the duty of every Member State, including France, to guarantee the protection of these women and to guarantee the education of Roma children, both boys and girls. This is the key to their freedom and to their independence. To be free and independent, they need stability and support; expulsions are unacceptable. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Madam President, freedom of religion is not guaranteed in Pakistan. In 2009, an increase in violent attacks against religious minorities has been observed, and that includes murders. In addition, nearly 80% of people from minority groups live below the poverty line. However, this is not the only problem with regard to the violation of human rights in Pakistan: other issues include a restriction on freedom of assembly, threats against civil society organisations, the arrest of trade unionists, kidnappings and the murder of journalists. Since Pakistan declared its support for the war against terrorism waged by the United States, hundreds, if not thousands, of people suspected of having links with terrorist groups have been arbitrarily detained: arrests without warrant, detentions with no legal basis or access to a lawyer, detentions in unspecified locations, forced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture. In the only prison in Lahore, 4 651 prisoners were held in 2009, while the prison has a capacity of only 1 050 prisoners. Violence against women continues to increase: rapes, suicides, acid attacks and women being burned. I would need not two minutes or two hours but two whole days to describe the ordeal suffered by young girls and women in Pakistan. It is within this context that this House, which is concerned about respect for women, freedom of conscience and human rights, is preparing to use its new power of veto for the conclusion of a readmission agreement between the European Union and Pakistan, thus demanding additional guarantees on the conditions for the implementation of such an agreement on the readmission of Pakistani nationals and Afghans who have transited through Pakistan.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would also like to echo the condolences that were just expressed by our fellow Members. We support wholeheartedly the resolution on the mass atrocities in Nigeria, which unfortunately represent only one aspect of the bleak human rights picture in that country. I would like, in the time I have been allotted, to speak about Nigeria’s prisons, which are full of prisoners whose rights are systematically violated. As a 2008 report by Amnesty International revealed, 65% of the prisoners in that country have never been found guilty of any crime. Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years. The problems are such that Nigeria has no choice but to recognise them and to promise to reform the system. We are still waiting for this reform. I am focusing my speech on the prisons because the current situation has once again reminded us of just how little value is put on the life of a human being in Nigeria, and even more so in the prisons. The National Economic Council of Nigeria has announced its plan to execute hundreds of death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in the prisons: killing to reduce prison overpopulation. There is nothing more shocking, especially when it is certain that many of these death-row inmates are innocent and the majority of them did not have the right to a fair trial, and particularly as in February 2009 the Nigerian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs declared before the UN that his country was applying a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. This is why, during the vote, I will table an oral amendment to denounce this recent move by several Nigerian governors. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as I indicated during the debate, I propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6: ‘Calls on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons, which would constitute a gross violation of human rights; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to Nigeria’s commitments at international level’.

Mr President, the resolution on Corporal Gilad Shalit, which we are examining today, supplements the many resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament on the human rights situation in the Middle East. Corporal Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage for 1 355 days, must be released as soon as possible. We demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released. The young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who has been detained by the Israeli authorities since 13 March 2005, must be released. The children imprisoned in Israel, in violation of the provisions of international law and the conventions on the rights of the child, must be released. The militants of the Non­Violent Popular Resistance Against the Occupation, such as Abdallah Abu Rahmah from Bil’in, must be released. The elected representatives, the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council – including Marwan Barghouti – must be released. It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East. The solutions do not lie in one­upmanship, exercised under repressive and violent conditions, an example of which was the assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai, which we condemn, not least because it makes securing the release of Gilad Shalit even more difficult. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, the Roma issue is being keenly felt in my region, the west of France. In Nantes, over 1 000 Roma are being expelled from one place after another due to a lack of government regulated sites in which to accommodate them. The few municipalities with facilities to accommodate the Roma, for example, Rezé and Indre, located in the Nantes conurbation, are stretched to the limit and lack the support of the public authorities. The most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties. Responses cannot be local. They must be global. Inclusion of the Roma must be incorporated in every European Union policy in order to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these European citizens. I would also like to draw attention to the specific situation of the women. The problems faced by Roma women are particularly striking, for example, in relation to marital violence or unwanted pregnancies. In France then, according to Médecins du monde
, one in two Roma women, or 43% of that group, will have had an abortion by the age of 22. The average age for the first pregnancy is 17. Only 10% of Roma women use contraception. The European Union must therefore include the gender perspective in all studies and laws that concern the Roma. Education must be a major priority. We must act urgently with the Roma communities to make them aware of their fundamental rights and to facilitate their access to public services. I hope that, at the second European summit on Roma inclusion, the European Union will show its determination to deal with the Roma issue in a comprehensive fashion. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, our debate today is motivated by three aspects concerning the generalised system of tariff preferences. First, the current regulation expires on 31 December 2011. To allow the European Parliament to exercise the powers it possesses under the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission must give us a new draft regulation by June 2010 at the latest. Secondly, the way the Generalised System of Preferences+ (GSP+) operates is anything but perfect. Who decides the list of beneficiary countries and on the basis of which criteria? Amazing! Who actually monitors the implementation of the 27 international conventions on social and environmental issues that are a requirement for becoming a beneficiary of the GSP+? We do not know. What results has the GSP+ shown? Has it resulted in sustainable development, the diversification of production and the creation of respectable employment, or rather in the proliferation of short­term contracts, an increase in the number of abandoned farms and the concentration of large holdings dedicated to export? We have no idea. Therefore, a thorough reform of the regulation is required to guarantee democratic control and to ensure that the measures taken do indeed achieve the desired objectives. However, the real reason for the debate this evening is the regrettable case of Colombia. Until today, the Commission has refused to launch an investigation into the very serious human rights violations in that country. Such an investigation is, however, provided for in the regulation. It is inconceivable, given the values advocated by the European Union, that, in seeking profits in the dairy, automotive, pharmaceuticals, telecoms and banking sector for our own multinationals, the EU should abandon GSP conditionality and, in the past few days, rush into a free trade agreement with Colombia. This is a fatal blow to Colombia’s trade unions, small farmers and consumers and to its national industrial production. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, the London Conference on Afghanistan has led to panic sweeping through the heart of Afghan society, and women are particularly afraid. The peace plan agreed on by 70 countries includes a fund to help reintegrate the Taliban and a Loya Jirga – peace council – must take place within the coming months in order for this reconciliation to be put into effect. Women do not want to and must not pay the price for this reconciliation. The Taliban are still demanding the suppression of women’s rights and the return of Sharia. It is to be feared that the Loya Jirga will modify the Constitution and that the articles protecting women’s rights will disappear; in particular, Article 22 of Chapter 2. Today, 8 March 2010, I solemnly request that the European Union act as guarantor of the future of Afghanistan’s women, as the re-emergence of the most femicidal regime in history cannot be countenanced. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, in Israel, Judge Goldstone’s work is demonised and completely discredited in the eyes of the public. At the same time, a violent smear campaign is being conducted against human rights defenders, notably the New Israel Fund, a foundation which funds the main Israeli organisations for the defence of human rights and, in particular, against its president, Naomi Chazan, a former Member of the Knesset, an academic and intellectual known for her commitment to the defence of women’s rights and peace. Thirteen pacifist groups, such as Bethlehem and Breaking the Silence, are the victims of a veritable witch-hunt. The European Union must provide unfailing support to human rights defenders in all countries including, of course, Israel, whose impunity is an insult to democratic values. The European Union must protect Israel from its own demons. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Back in 2006, the UN acknowledged that the most vulnerable populations and the poorest populations were the main victims of climate change. The fact is, women form the majority in both categories. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, although women are already discriminated against in terms of access to and control of land, the increasing scarcity of cultivable soil due to drought reduces their means of existence even further. A recent report forecasts that in 2050, a billion people will have fled from hostile environments. The loss of security of these climate migrants, forced to take refuge in makeshift camps, raises the level of threat against women. However, we have to admit that in the last 15 years, not one European legislative text on the environment has included the aspect of gender. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I therefore call on the European Union and its Member States to integrate the perspective of equality between women and men in all impact assessments, legislation and policies regarding the environment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is being threatened with strangulation. Subjected to a strict Israeli blockade since 2007, in 2009, Gaza’s population suffered the bloody attack that prompted the Goldstone Report, which was damning for the Israeli military authorities accused of war crimes. Today, it is the Egyptian authorities that have set about building an underground metal barrier in order to prevent any supplies getting through the tunnels. When will there be a stop to this collective punishment imposed on men, women and children, whose suffering is being manipulated on a political stage from a different era? The European Union must act. The European Union has all the trumps as Israel’s main economic partner and the principal contributor of aid to the Palestinian Territories. The Israeli Government will only accept a change of policy under pressure from the international community. The EU can play a decisive role in the resumption of the peace process and in the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state within the borders established in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Madam President, yes, we will have to emerge from the Afghan trap into which we fell because of the policy pursued by George Bush. However, the question is not when, but how, we pull out of Afghanistan. If the countless mistakes made by the international community are not called into question, we are in danger of completely losing the confidence and support of the Afghan population, for the benefit of the Taliban. The militarisation of humanitarian aid and development aid must stop because it is creating confusion in people’s minds and discrediting the NGOs. We must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the Afghan reformists. Why is Europe in Afghanistan? Because the United States said so, or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence? We need to strengthen the most effective Afghan structures, to prioritise investment in public services – education, health and transport – and to support good governance of local powers, since the culture of these countries requires us to reflect on the relevance of the nation state. Europe should, for instance, support Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan Province. Her appointment is a first in the history of this country where, you will recall, we went in 2001 to help the female population. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the 2000s have been characterised in Europe by a proliferation of security laws: surveillance, repression, detention and imprisonment. Budgets linked to these policies have exploded. Yet violence against women is not in decline. It follows that, in 2008, 156 women died from injuries inflicted by their spouse in France, where almost one in ten women is a victim of marital violence. The security measures implemented for video surveillance, filing or biometrics do not meet the real security needs of women. This violence affects all women in all countries, whatever their origin, social background or religion. It is linked to discrimination based on gender. Sexism, just like racism, consists in denying another person an alter ego status. How do we combat sexism? What we require is strong political will to inform, prevent and protect, the political will to abolish all forms of discrimination in which violence takes root. Is not the safety of more than half of all European citizens, in other words female citizens, worth a substantial political investment? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have rightly spoken about tax evasion. You know that this struggle is extremely important for us, because it is a struggle that revolves around economic efficiency and social justice. Talking about these matters is all very well, but we would like to see action. Where are the Commission’s statements? Where is the pressure from the Commission to help Greece to try to recover the EUR 100 to 200 billion that are in Switzerland, according to the Greek Government’s estimates? I know that this is not necessarily Greece’s priority. Greece holds the primary responsibility for this inability to genuinely levy tax. All the same, where is the action by the Commission to exert pressure on Switzerland, so that the money can be taxed and then return to Greece? Just now, Daniel Cohn-Bendit was talking about what President Obama did in relation to the Swiss banks and banking secrecy. Where is the initiative by the European Commission to do exactly what Mr Obama did, namely, to impose an extra-territorial law that is binding and eliminates banking secrecy? Where is the Commission’s initiative to have a European list of tax havens? On the OECD’s blacklist, there is one state, or two states, or, from time to time, three states; they sign mutual conventions, and then there is no one left on the list. All of a sudden, the struggle is empty, because the blacklist is empty. Where is the Commission’s initiative? I want to see concrete answers, because it is all very well to make these grand declarations before Parliament, but it is actually much better to take tangible political action to put pressure on these states. I am fully aware that these states constitute the main obstacle to progress. We need you, however, to put pressure on the states. Mr Barroso, I would like to put a final question to you, not about tax havens, but about austerity. When we have informal discussions with your departments and those of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, this is what your officials tell us. When you put all the austerity policies and the requirements that have now been imposed by the Commission to reduce budget deficits into the same economic model, it is not possible to show that there is truly a path that will enable us to reduce the deficits. In fact, growth is being damaged to such a degree, and tax revenue is being decreased to such an extent, that the end result is a greater deficit, not a lower one. That is the case, for example, in Spain. The debate is also a live issue in the Netherlands, and perhaps soon will be in France too. Mr Barroso, the reality is that when you use these figures, it does not work. When are you going to admit this? When are you going to change direction? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Ms Kroes, in your speech on behalf of the Commission you said: ‘Eurobonds without fiscal consolidation will not work’. You are quite right. However, what we have today is fiscal consolidation without Eurobonds. What we are proposing here in Parliament is a balance between the two. The package you are proposing today is unbalanced. These are not our words. Listen to the rating agencies. When Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded France a few weeks ago, what it was saying was: ‘Austerity alone does not work’. You do not have to believe me, you do not have to believe the left here in the European Parliament, but you can believe the rating agencies, if you listen more closely to them. The challenge is to put in place today a roadmap because we do not underestimate the legal challenges and technical complexities. It is precisely because it is complicated, however, that we need to start immediately in order to send a message and prepare for the battle as quickly as possible. Over and above the technical and legal issues, there is also the political dimension. In Europe today do we want to do what the United States did 220 years ago, which was to pool, gradually, its public debt as a sign of solidarity and a reflection of a political will to create a political union? I believe that a majority of this House would wish to move in that direction. Surprise us in the European Commission! For once, be truly European and ambitious! Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, there are two democratic institutions in Europe: the Council, which represents the Heads of State or Government, who have been elected, and the European Parliament, which is elected by universal suffrage. For two years, the Council has had sole responsibility for resolving the crisis, and for two years, it has failed. It has failed every quarter by holding another last-chance summit. I will see you in another three months at the next last-chance summit, because last week’s summit completely failed to resolve the issues that were on the table. When you listen to the rating agencies – the infamous financial markets that you are keen to reassure – what do they say? They do not say, ‘more austerity, more discipline’. They say, ‘a comprehensive package including budgetary discipline’. No one is disputing the fact that we need to adopt this approach, but it is just one aspect of the package, not the only one. We are well aware that, today, with this package, with the outcome of this summit, you have added to the citizens’ concerns without even reassuring the markets. In other words, it is a complete waste of time. I shall see you again in three months’ time! However, there is a second European institution that is democratic, namely the European Parliament. As Mr Schulz, Mr Daul and Ms Harms said, it is our responsibility to recognise today that we need to take the lead in establishing an alternative crisis plan, one that offers a different approach from that of the Council, which is all about failure. It is our responsibility not just to vote on a resolution, but to use all the powers bestowed on us by the Treaties to their full extent, to shoulder our responsibilities and to be capable, between us, of reaching compromises. If we prove incapable of reaching compromises between us, then, at that point, we will no longer have the legitimacy to criticise others who are incapable of reaching them. However, we have three months to get there. We have a responsibility to do so; the people of Europe are watching us. Pascal Canfin,

Madam President, the report we are voting on today concludes a year’s work and is the first time that the European Union will ban a financial product used to speculate on the debt of states. This report shows clearly that we have the political will to work together in this European Parliament and that we are capable of ensuring that our voices are heard, capable of negotiating, and capable of bringing the states round to our point of view. We in the European Parliament were the only ones to defend this idea of banning uncovered credit default swaps and types of speculation on sovereign debt – the Commission was against the idea – and, in the end, we have won the battle. I therefore urge you to vote in favour of this text. I am very pleased with it and I would like to thank very sincerely the European Parliament negotiators, especially Markus Ferber and Robert Goebbels, who helped me in these negotiations. (Applause) Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, in your speech you talked about peer pressure and market forces, but I think you forgot to mention people pressure because, when I look at the plan that you adopted yesterday evening, I see that you are applying the same approach to Italy as you are to Greece. This is an unpleasant approach and it does not work. If you want to increase the problems we already have in Greece by applying the same approach to Italy tomorrow, please feel free to do so, but I am sure that people pressure will change the landscape. You have not mentioned the word ‘tax’ at all. Several MEPs have mentioned in this House that tax evasion was a major problem in Europe. Our region has the greatest fiscal competition in the world. We are a single market but we do not have fiscal harmonisation. We simply must resolve this paradoxical situation. You know the figures. In Italy, according to the government, EUR 120 billion escape the Italian tax system, EUR 200 billion in Greece, EUR 100 billion in France and EUR 150 billion in Germany. There is no point in calling on casual workers, the unemployed, junior civil servants and the retired to make a contribution if you do not make it a priority to tackle tax evasion. You have not said a single word about this. This is an outrageous and unjust shortcoming in the outcome of yesterday’s summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, President Barroso, I would like to ask you a question. If it is no trouble to you, would you mind listening to it? I am not going to make a long speech. My question is a specific one: do you know how much Greek money – according to the Greek Government itself – is deposited in Switzerland and escaping Greek taxation? EUR 200 billion, which is the equivalent of Greece’s annual GDP and of two-thirds of Greece’s debt. I am still waiting for your initiative to impose taxation on this money which has escaped the Greek tax system. I am also waiting for a strong initiative on this matter from Greece’s socialist government. It would have no macroeconomic impact on Greece, since this money has already gone elsewhere, but this policy would be completely legitimate from a social point of view. However, in order to take this initiative, the Greek Government needs the EU. You will argue that this is complicated, but there is a very simple example: the United States, which is fighting a daily battle to have Swiss banking secrecy lifted for its own citizens and which is winning that battle. Meanwhile, we are either doing nothing, or doing things in an utterly disorganised and counterproductive manner, as the UK and Germany have just done by signing an agreement with Switzerland limiting the EU’s scope for action. It is up to you to take an initiative: EUR 200 billion is a very large sum. We cannot ask European taxpayers to show solidarity if rich Greek citizens do not show any either. Pascal Canfin

 Mr President, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, Mr Rehn, you have focused your comments in this debate on economic governance, that is to say, on the package of six directives that are currently being negotiated. The specific purpose of this report is to integrate this work but, also, to go beyond it. It also aims to indicate a path, a vision that goes beyond the very short-term discussions in which you are rightly involved. However, do take the time to read this report because it outlines a majority view. It is not just the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is a vision that results from a compromise, a compromise reached by a majority. Examining its contents provides a breath of fresh air with regard to the current situation. What is the issue at stake today? The issue is working out who will be paying for the crisis, who will be paying for these 20 percentage points of public debt, accumulated over three years, to save the markets, the banks, and Europe from a very significant recession. By continuing to focus on the issue of public finances, you are targeting the fire-fighter rather than the arsonist. If the Member States have spent 20 points of their Gross Domestic Product in additional debt, it was not for the pleasure of doing so, but because they had no other choice. In solely considering the consequences and limiting yourselves to a European policy focusing on managing the consequences of this crisis, and not the causes, I think you are missing the point and you are causing pro-European opinion among Europeans to become significantly weaker. We know that today, we are threatened by this trend and this isolationism. The second major issue which this report seeks to address concerns the balance of power between the Member States and the markets. We created the euro, in part, to prevent the markets from speculating on our currencies. That is what we saw in the 1990s. Currently, we are at the point at which we must prevent the markets from speculating on our public debts and, in order to do so, we have two tools available to us. The first is Eurobonds, which would involve mutualising our debt to ensure a deep liquid market, such that it is no longer possible to speculate against the single public debt market. The function of the second tool is to limit the capacity of the financial markets to speculate on public debt through a number of instruments. This is the path that a majority in Parliament is ready to propose to you. Seize this opportunity, President-in-Office, on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I wanted to propose submitting the report on the legislative proposal to the scrutiny of this House, for the same reasons that we did so regarding the report on derivatives. We have already had four negotiation meetings with the Council. We are now sending a very strong political message, but we are not voting at first reading in order that we can continue the discussions and negotiations in a very practical manner starting next week or in September. I would therefore like to request a report concerning the vote on the legislative proposal. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the positive atmosphere he has created in the debates we have been able to have. They have resulted in an ambitious and responsible text on which there is very broad agreement in Parliament. I would also like to emphasise two points on which we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, presented proposals, and which were subsequently taken up by all the political groups that supported this text. The first point concerns harmonisation by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the rules on collateral-related competition between clearing houses. We know that one of the great dangers of this text is that risks will be concentrated in clearing houses when they were previously spread around. They will be concentrated in clearing houses, which actually compete with each other by reducing the level of security within the system. No provision was made in the initial Commission proposal to prevent clearing houses competing on the level of security, an important criterion of which is the level of collateral. The second point that I wished to emphasise is our proposal to expand Parliament’s text; we have removed the threshold set by the Commission which limited the transmission of information – the reporting of trading information – because not all derivatives will be traded in clearing houses. We have therefore made provision for all information, be it on over-the-counter trading or on trading carried out in clearing houses, to be transmitted to the regulator so that he has an overview of the risks that exist. I hope that the Council will be receptive to this important development of Parliament’s text. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this report concerns short selling and the supervision of credit default swaps, those products that insure debt against default, in particular state default. The origins of this text lie in the Greek crisis, which began in spring 2010. Following certain movements on the financial markets that had been observed, a political request was put to Commissioner Barnier and to the European Commission to establish European rules on short selling and on sovereign debt speculation tools. The Commission drafted that regulation in September. This was followed by the adoption of our position in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March, and of the Council position in May. Since then we have been negotiating, because we have already had five trialogues, which have enabled us to reach a number of possible compromises. Although they are not here, I should like to thank the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who took part in these trialogues and helped to move this matter forward. However, after those four or five negotiating sessions, we and the shadow rapporteurs who voted by a majority for this text in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in other words, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which I represent – took the decision to vote in the July part-session for this text, but not for the legislative proposal, in order to send two messages. The first message consists in saying that we want to carry on negotiating with the Council because it has been almost a year since the Commission tabled this text and because, on this issue as on others, Parliament wishes to adopt a responsible yet ambitious attitude. We want these texts; we want the rules on financial markets to change. Too often, we have to wait for the Council, which clearly takes much longer to make its decisions than we do. Therefore, we want to carry on negotiating, which means that we will not be voting for the legislative proposal tomorrow. However, we also want to send three messages on the substance in order to reaffirm the positions adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which will become the positions of the European Parliament too when it adopts them – by a very large majority, I think – tomorrow. The first issue concerns the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). In our version we have strengthened the role of ESMA, and you have reminded us many times, Commissioner, of the importance of that institution when it comes to ensuring the consistency of the single-market rules on financial services. I have to say that the position adopted in the Council – to have a red line that is an absolute red line for us, to create a right of veto for States on European regulatory issues concerning sovereign debt – is completely unacceptable. The second point that I wished to raise is that we in Parliament want a simple rule: when you sell an asset, be it a share or a bond, you must be able to know for certain where to find it; there must be an agreement with the person who is going to lend it to you. This is what is known as the ‘hard locate’ rule in technical speak. This is Parliament’s position, and I think it is a sensible one. The final point that I should like to emphasise, and which is obviously a key element of the discussions we are having, is the ban on naked credit default swaps. This position is shared by a large majority of the European Parliament. We do not see how it is possible, in financial terms, to cover oneself against a risk with a credit default swap without being liable for that risk, in other words without owning the bond of the country that issued the security. It is a nonsense and it opens the door to speculation. To conclude, I would say that the current debates on Greece prove us right, because some of the arguments made to limit the Greek restructuring consist in saying, ‘Yes, but some people have speculated. If the debt is restructured, they are going to make money without having invested in Greece.’ That is exactly what we want to put a stop to. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, I just wanted to say something to my fellow Member, Mr Kamall − since he is one of the negotiators of this text and is very familiar with it, and if he is not, he only has to read it – concerning his argument that credit default swaps (CDSs) are used as proxy hedges and therefore should not be banned. As the text says, when CDSs are used for proxy hedging, they are not uncovered. It would be helpful, therefore, if you could change your argument or read the text, because we are debating for nothing otherwise. (Applause)
 The second point that I wished to make is that we really want to complete this text because we feel that the situation is urgent. No one is saying that CDSs caused the Greek crisis. It would be absurd to think that. However, they are clearly being used to fan the flames by financial operators whose sole aim is to exacerbate the crisis so that they can make money at some point. While we are on the subject of CDSs, I should like to tell you that this text only covers the purchase of these swaps. This presents another problem, which was also raised by Mr Kamall, concerning the fact that operators who sell CDSs, such as US banks and hedge funds, are supposed to provide a guarantee against the risk of default to banks such as BNP, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. For those banks, it is a way of getting the risk off their balance sheets. However, those who sell CDSs, such as hedge funds, have a lot less capital than the banks. This tool has the effect of reducing capital requirements and hence the security of the system. Since you are working on the Capital Requirements Directive 4, I should like it if you could also cover the sale of CDSs and the obligations incumbent on sellers of CDSs, rather than just focusing on buyers, as is the case in this text. Pascal Canfin,

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, as you know, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is traditionally very attached to the EIB. We believe that it is an extremely important public policy instrument, and it is because we are very attached to it that we are also very demanding of it – the two go hand in hand. Our view of the EIB is that, ultimately, it is a bank in its own right, and as such, it is subject to bank constraints, which must be taken into account. Several of my fellow Members rightly referred to the fact that the EIB ought perhaps to take account of new constraints linked to the banking sector. At the same time, it is a truly exceptional bank, because it is indeed funded by taxpayers’ money. It is also there to do what the others are not doing, and to adopt rules that go beyond what the private sector can do. I should like to stress one or two points on which I feel that the EIB could do even better, even though progress has been made in recent months. The first point concerns the issue of tax havens. This is an extremely important fight not only for us, but also, I think, for a very large majority of my fellow Members in this House. The crisis showed that tax havens obscure, undermine and weaken the entire financial system and the world economy. Therefore, in this report, the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens. I believe that that practice should be stopped. I am well aware that you have operational constraints on the ground, but there is a political point here, which is that, if you are the power behind Europe, you have to fight battles. If you fight battles, then I think that the battle against tax havens should be one of them. As for us, we would obviously like to go further; in other words, we would like you to attach conditions to EIB loans to businesses that are not part of the entire value chain in tax havens and which are, at the very least, on the OECD’s blacklist, which is currently being revised. The second point that we wished to raise concerns the issue of monitoring and governance. Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now. I believe that we should extend the choice, that we should increase the level of joint accountability so that the choice of projects involving taxpayers’ money is made as democratically and as transparently as possible. The third point is about measuring the benefits of your action. You measure them in financial terms too, of course. As I was saying earlier, you are a bank in your own right, which means that you have challenges to meet in terms of the risk/reward ratio. However, you aim to provide other benefits too, and that is why public money is used. You aim to provide benefits in terms of social cohesion, in terms of the fight against poverty, in terms of environmental protection. I think that you could make still more progress in reporting, in measuring these non-financial benefits, which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy. I think that, rather than setting the financial benefits against the non-financial benefits, you should carry out as broad an assessment as possible, and not limit it to monetary and financial issues alone. Lastly, the final point of my speech will relate to climate change. The report specifically states that you must pursue all the EU’s objectives. One of the official objectives of the European Union is to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue to finance coal-fired power plants, which have a 40-year life span and which emit huge amounts of CO2

 – (FR) 
I have a very simple answer to that. I believe that the EIB has cost UK taxpayers a lot less than other, completely private UK banks have cost them, and I believe that the general interest, just like that of UK taxpayers, is far better served by the EIB than by other UK banks that the taxpayer has had to bail out. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that many of my fellow Members will have remembered that the background to this package for the Single Market comes from the Monti report, and the Monti report recommended a considerable compromise between those who advocate more competition, if you like, and those who advocate giving more weight to social, environmental and tax-related aspects. I believe that, here in Parliament – and as long as the texts are not unpicked in the votes we shall be having in plenary in a few hours – we have succeeded in finding this compromise, including in the 14 proposals that emerge from the three reports as a whole. I also know that you are having discussions, in the College of Commissioners, to determine which central themes you will be retaining, and we shall clearly be paying great attention to whether this balance found within Parliament and desired by Mr Monti is taken up and extended to the 12 central project themes to which you have referred. I would like to highlight three items which seem particularly important to me, further to what Mrs Turunen said a little while ago on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The first aspect concerns competition. The issue of the Single Market is to ascertain where we can focus competition. Do we focus competition on innovation, on products or do we focus competition on the rules, through environmental dumping or social dumping? I believe we have indeed struck a balance here in Parliament – and I hope you can carry it over into the Commission – which is to say ‘yes’ to more competition through innovation, ‘yes’ to more capital investment, but ‘yes’ also to a social clause, ‘yes’ to environmental standards that ensure that competition does not lead to regulatory dumping. Those are the two aspects that I believe are fundamental to our compromise. The second item that I would like to highlight concerns the tax-related aspects. When you proposed the consolidated corporate tax base for multinational companies in your first version of the Single Market Act, it was not an optional proposal: in other words, all companies had to be subject to this consolidated tax base. In the proposal put out by the Commission 10 days or so ago, it is an optional measure: in other words, instead of building up an aspect of the Single Market, the Commission is tearing one down. You will be adding a new system, you will be adding a layer of complexity, you will be adding regulatory arbitrage instead of creating tax harmonisation. The proposal tabled by the Commission a fortnight ago runs totally counter to what we in Parliament want and to what you had proposed. The last point I want to highlight very quickly is the notion of reciprocity, in exactly the same terms as you have done. The Single Market accounts for 500 million people; it is an economic entity, but it is also a political entity which must afford us more influence in shaping globalisation. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I wanted to clarify why we voted in favour of this Single Market Act. I think it is a step forward. Parliament managed to find the right compromises that do not flush the text of its content but, instead, put real pressure on those who, in the Commission, want the Single Market to continue to adopt a purely free market approach, without including social issues, tax issues or environmental issues. I also merely wanted to clarify that paragraph 54, which deals with public services, services of general interest, is problematic, and we therefore voted against part of this paragraph, which continues to call, ideologically but in veiled terms, for further liberalisation. We argue instead in favour of European public services and securing the European framework, leaving each Member State the option to continue organising public services as they wish, especially at territorial level. Pascal Canfin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission, and the European Union in particular, to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned. As you know, Brussels is the international lobbying capital, before Washington. There are more lobbyists in Brussels than in Washington, and one of the ways in which they exert their influence on the Commission is through these famous expert groups. I am a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You have, for example, a group of banking experts. Ninety-five per cent of the members of that expert group are bankers, and not just any bankers: only bankers from finance and investment banks, money market banks, and all the major US banks – J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – are represented in it. On the other hand, there are no NGOs or trade unions in that expert group. The idea that the Commission should be advised only by investment bankers, and US investment bankers at that, with regard to changing banking rules seems totally surreal to me after the financial crisis we have gone through. Hence there are some very precise questions and some very precise points in this oral question being put to you: are you going to change the composition of these expert groups? Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided? In the European Parliament, in fact, this is a completely transpartisan issue. There are left-wing MEPs, right-wing MEPs, Green MEPs and liberals who are very interested in these issues. Why were we not involved earlier in the reforms that you have introduced? Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, in 2006, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the Services Directive, and today, we consider the report assessing the implementation of this Services Directive, previously known as the Bolkestein Directive, to be equally unsatisfactory. The Verts/ALE Group will therefore vote against this report. I should like to make it clear, Mrs Gebhardt, that you did everything you could to achieve the best possible compromises. However, I believe that some red lines have unfortunately been crossed in this report, which means that we cannot vote in favour of it. I should also like to state that you took great care to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I certainly do not wish to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union, either. If France, for example, transposed the Services Directive and chose to include day nurseries in it, when almost all of the other countries chose to do the opposite, it is clearly the responsibility of the French Government and not of the European Union. Therefore, the Verts/ALE Group is certainly not voting against this report in order to criticise the way in which the directive has been transposed in France. It is doing so on account of two key points. The first is that we asked time and again, during the discussions, for the Member States to assess the impact that the initial transposition of the Services Directive had on the quality of jobs and services. Unfortunately, that assessment of the impact on job and service quality could not be integrated into the report. We also called for an assessment of the cost impact for public authorities. Every time we try to take steps to regulate the financial markets, for example, we are told that it will cost a fortune. Here, we have a very high cost for public authorities at a time when budgets are tight, and no one wants to assess it in order to weigh up the pros and cons of the Services Directive. My final point is in the form of a question to Commissioner Barnier. Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain an assurance in this report that the European Commission will finally take note of Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and present a proposal for a directive on public services. Can you tell us when the Commission will finally face up to its responsibilities on this point? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn, I genuinely hope that you will look at the work done by the European Parliament on the subjects we have been dealing with today – the Berès report and the Feio report – because, of course, we are now working as colegislators on economic governance. I can tell you that together with four pro-European groups in Parliament at least, we have made a genuine effort to work on compromises that will achieve something. We have just come from the discussions to try to tie up the problems. Some people are talking about the budget, some are talking about tax measures, and some are talking about governance. What we need today is for the Commission – and it is your role to do this, we are trying to do it and it is your role to do it also – to propose an overall package: something in the spirit of the Monti report that is also along the lines of what Michel Barnier has been trying to do in the context of the internal market. I am waiting for an overall package from Mr Barroso, which should show us how to get ourselves out of the economic crisis. It should not just be about macro-economic governance, but should be along the lines of reading three or four dossiers on macro-economics, tax and the budget and then saying ‘here is the package’. I am sure that if you do that, you will have a very large majority in the European Parliament to support the initiative. If we only look at the issue of public finance, for example, two or three years ago, the Commission and its departments were themselves saying that, of all the countries, Spain was sticking to the Stability and Growth Pact most closely and that Spain’s public finances were in order. The problem is that the instability came from elsewhere and now Spain is in a terrible situation, as is Ireland. We can clearly see that focusing on public finances alone will not help us resolve the crisis. The compromises that we have proposed in the various reports that have been presented today, which will be voted on tomorrow, represent the sum of these issues. They are a way of saying that, yes, we do need to strengthen budgetary discipline. Of course we do. However, to ensure that this budgetary discipline does not lead to social breakdown, but only to public expenditure cuts, we need, at the same time, a European budget package that will finance investment and a tax package that will allow Member States to impose certain taxes. My last question for Mr Rehn, and for Mr Barroso especially, is therefore: are you genuinely in favour of the common corporate tax basis? Do you genuinely support it? It has been shelved by the Commission for 10 years now and for 10 years, you have failed to deal with the matter. It is now time that you did so. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,

 Madam President, Commissioner, my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted. It is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors. I must say that the ability to strictly limit the variable remuneration of directors of banks assisted by the public purse, and even the possibility to defer up to 70% of traders’ bonuses in the long-term interests of the bank and, potentially therefore, to take account of the risks taken and the negative effects of these risks in order to reduce these bonuses, are important rules which translate the G20’s commitments in principle into real figures at European level. However, I must also say that in negotiations with all the other shadow rapporteurs and with the rapporteur herself, we constantly came up against a lack of commitment by the States, against the huge gap between fine rhetoric on the regulation of capitalism, on the raising of the moral standards of capitalism, on the one hand, and the negotiating positions of the Council and the main States, which constantly refused to agree figures, and tried to reduce the scope of and water down all of our ambitious proposals, on the other. I must say, Commissioner, that the Commission has largely been on our side in this struggle. Therefore, I think that this is an achievement which we can share. Now, there is an important issue at stake. As we lost, we have had to make compromises. We lost a number of battles aimed at agreeing figures, and we have had to replace these figures with a number of words, often rather portmanteau words, such as ‘justified’, ‘appropriate’ and ‘balanced’. The challenge now is for the future European banking authority to translate these principles and portmanteau words into real figures, which will then be applied by all banks and all Member States. I would therefore like to know, Mr Barnier, how you intend to apply pressure on and strictly monitor this future process so that it does not distort the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow.

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, as you know, there are two ways to reduce deficits. Expenditure can be cut or taxes can be increased. All States can cut expenditure at the same time, although separately, without needing any European coordination. However, to increase taxes and, more specifically, taxes on capital, companies, profits and banks, they do need European coordination. Your communication last week contained absolutely no mention at all of this issue. My question, which is a fairly common one among Members from all groups, is as follows: over the course of the next few weeks, are you going to propose a tax coordination plan to provide Member States with the means of recovering margins for manoeuvre so that they can increase certain taxes, which is something they are unable to do separately? This is the added value which the European Commission can provide at the present time. Unfortunately, you do not have any plans in this area. Mr Verhofstadt was saying that you had a right to take the initiative. In the current situation, you have a duty to take the initiative in this area. Pascal Canfin,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, in your speech you mentioned Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted to you a few days ago. There is a very interesting aspect in Mr Monti’s report, and that is the emphasis it places on the pressing need for us to move on to the next stage of fiscal cooperation. It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied, but that if they are applied solely to expenditure, through cuts in expenditure, this will almost certainly lead to a recession. It is therefore crucial to use both pillars and, in particular, the fiscal pillar, to enable the Member States to collect a number of additional receipts from the economic activities and economic operators whose tax burden has been repeatedly reduced over the last few years: the profits from companies, capital, and financial transactions. To do this, we absolutely must have European coordination. This is the conclusion reached in Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted two days ago. However, there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission. There is no mention whatsoever of this issue in Mr Rehn’s communication published a few days ago. This is one of the major pillars, one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time. Do this, and this will establish the link – Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy, the report on the governance of the euro area, on the single market, and employment and education issues. We are well aware that, if we abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact – which, incidentally, is vital – but do so only by cutting expenditure, then we are on course for social regression and economic recession. Therefore, my question is very clear: Mr Barnier, as a representative of the Commission, what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks? How are you going to convince your colleagues – assuming that you are already convinced yourself – of the need for an action plan, for a fiscal coordination plan so that Member States are able once more to raise new revenues on the basis of a number of agreements? What are your proposals? You are not entitled to stay silent. The Commission has a right to initiate legislation, but, today, on these issues, that right has become a duty. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, our public finances are in a situation of crisis and we know that part of the solution may lie in reducing some spending, but that a large part of the solution is in Member States’ ability to raise more funds. The issue at stake, therefore, is knowing what type of tax may be increased, what type of tax must be increased, and what the consequences of these tax increases will be. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance estimates that it would be difficult to significantly raise the taxes paid by small businesses, which create the majority of jobs. It is difficult to increase the taxes paid by families – with the possible exception of those paid by the richest – because in the majority of cases, these are already high enough, particularly in Europe. The question, therefore, is: which taxes should be increased? If taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises are not increased and nor is VAT, other possibilities will inevitably have to be sought. We estimate that a tax on financial transactions is, in the end, the least painful tax for the European economy. It is the tax with the least negative consequences for the global competitiveness of the European economy. Moreover, the cost of financial transactions has diminished enormously over the last ten years or so, both because of a certain number of technical improvements – if they can be called that – and because of European regulation. In fact, these reductions in costs have been entirely absorbed by the financial industry and the banks. It would not be totally unjustified if, by means of a tax on financial transactions, part of the profit saved by the banks from these decreased costs made its way back to the public authorities that saved them. As is always the case, this House is turning this into a very ideological debate, but it is actually quite technical. Transaction costs existed before; they have been reduced. Today, we are proposing that they be increased again in order for public authorities to benefit from these technical improvements and not just private actors. Naturally, the issue of whether the European Union can take this step forward on its own is being raised. It is clear to everyone that it would be better if this were done within an international framework. If others – specifically, the United States – do not follow our lead, the following question arises: is the European Union’s prospect of achieving this then ruled out? Some statements – for example, that of Mr Gauzès – suggest that the Group of the European People’s Party believes that Europe can do nothing on its own. That situation would not, of course, be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent. Does that, however, mean that the European Union should necessarily position itself at the lowest common denominator, that it should have the least possible regulation, and align itself with the least ambitious actor? That does not seem to us to be the sort of thing that will strengthen the European Union’s position of leadership in the world. Furthermore, it is possible to imagine the European Union putting this transaction in place on its own. This is quite simply because the capital flows that concern us start out in the European Union, then may move elsewhere, only to return to the European Union. When these flows leave and return, we have the opportunity to demand that they can be traced, and to know whether or not they have been subject to this tax on financial transactions. If they have, no problem. If they have not, then we can deduct an entry or exit tax. We have done so for years in the real economy with the Common External Tariff. Financial globalisation is now obliging us to do so in the financial sphere of the economy, and it is entirely possible from a technical point of view. What is needed is the political will. Pascal Canfin,

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to tell the Spanish Presidency that we fully support its analysis of the political will to progress towards new tools of governance and towards an economic union, and not just a monetary union, as Mr Bullmann also pointed out. You will have our political group’s full support in this undertaking. In actual fact, leaving aside the Greek case, which is at stake, I believe that we need to review all the tools of economic governance of the euro area and, in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact. More than half of the Member States in the euro area no longer adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, let us not forget that, until fairly recently – until the crisis – Spain was fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, but that did not stop it, two years later, from finding itself in a radically different situation, with a 20% unemployment rate, or from completely disregarding those criteria. What does this mean? It means that, with a Stability and Growth Pact that is narrowly focused on public finance criteria, which are absolutely necessary but insufficient, until recently, Spain controlled its public debt and its public deficit but, at the same time, allowed its private debt to soar. There has been an explosion in private debt, a speculative bubble on the property market, and a recession on a much greater scale than elsewhere, with the result that a massive injection of public money is required. This is indeed proof that, by having a blinkered view of the Stability and Growth Pact and a view of euro area governance that is focused solely on public debt, one fails to see the bigger picture, which would make it possible to anticipate the next crisis and to prevent it. I should therefore like to know what proposals both the Spanish Presidency and the Commission have put on the table in order, of course, to reaffirm the Stability and Growth Pact and, above all, to integrate it into a more comprehensive system. Secondly, you say – and you are right – that public finances need to be controlled better, that a return to more stable debt levels is necessary. In your view, does that depend solely on a decrease in public spending, or does it also depend on the ability to increase certain taxes? If so, which ones? Also, what role can fiscal cooperation between ourselves play in enabling the Member States to regain some room for manoeuvre that will allow them to make up their deficits, not only by reducing expenditure, but also by regaining some room for manoeuvre so as to increase their revenues? Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, in her speech, Mrs Malmström said that action was needed, not just fine words. I can tell you that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will follow the results of this summit between the United States and the European Union very closely, since it comes at a key moment in the path leading us, on the one hand, to Copenhagen and, on the other, to the reform of the international financial system. On this last point, the casino has now reopened, banks’ profits are once again reaching historic levels – USD 437 billion in profits for the US banks – and our view is that there is less political will than there was six months ago. We therefore have enormous expectations of this summit, which is intended to show that, in both the US and Europe, the political will to regulate capitalism and to regulate the financial institutions is still present. In order to achieve this, we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points. The first is combating tax havens, and this is something that was not mentioned in your speeches. The US Treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of USD 100 billion. We therefore wanted to emphasise this point and to tell you that it is important for the United States and Europe to work jointly on this issue at the summit. The second point, which has just been mentioned, is the tax on financial transactions. When Mr Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency, he expressly said that he was in favour of such a tax. A fortnight ago, the European Parliament for the first time voted, by a majority, for a tax on financial transactions, provided that they formed part of an international framework. The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States/European Union Summit in early November. My last point is that on climate, we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr Obama’s foot. President Obama wants to act, but he is blocked by his majority. The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking, at the end of October, to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30% reduction in its own emissions. Once this is done, we will be able to make progress in negotiations. This is our responsibility. We must do it before the summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
),

− The Verts/ALE Group voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 for several reasons, among which: – by referring to the need to develop new indicators which go beyond GDP, the EP gives a clear signal that ‘economic recovery’ must not be based on a ‘business as usual approach’, which is in line with our request to develop a ‘Green New Deal’; – the resolution insists on the need to tackle global imbalances, especially exchange rate imbalances and commodity price volatility within a multilateral framework; – the resolution sends a good signal towards the setting-up of a tax on financial transactions, which was never the case until now; – as regards the financial crisis, the EP makes a strong statement on international coordination that should aim to avoid regulatory arbitrage. It also stresses that the upgrading of prudential rules within the context of the G20 consists of a ‘minimum harmonisation’ approach that must not prevent the EU from applying higher standards; – as regards supervision of the financial sectors, the EP has made a significant move towards an enhanced and more centralised approach on financial market supervision, with the setting up of a single financial supervisory authority being a final objective.

Mr President, you spoke of the governance of the IMF. I would also like to know if you intend to raise the issue, at the G20, of the conditionality of the money that the IMF lends to states. We have seen that what were previously very liberal conditions have not been changed, and this applies in particular to the loans that were granted to some European States. What is your position on this? My second question is: what is the position of the Commission and the Council on the Chinese proposal to put in place a slightly different international currency, in an effort to regulate the financial system using an alternative to the dollar? My third question is: the G20 is also part of the preparations for Copenhagen. The Commission has proposed a total sum of between EUR 2 and 15 billion to help the countries of the South adapt to climate change. What is the Council’s position? What sum will you put on the table at the G20 next week? Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I have a question for my colleagues about the Polish demand, because I get the impression that this debate is becoming nationalised and that by authorising shale gas exploitation in Poland we are trying to give it European legitimacy. As regards potential, what do you have to say about the figures and the potential that were announced and then the subsequent discovery that there is seven times less potential for exploiting and exploring shale gas in Poland? What do you have to say about subsidiarity, seeing as you are invoking the principle? Does Poland intend to apply subsidiarity to environmental regulations? As it stands today, this falls under European jurisdiction and no country may decide not to apply the regulations. Finally, on the question of acceptance, what answer would you give to the European public, especially those who have lodged complaints with the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions?

 Mr President, My question is very short and simple. There was no answer just before about the expert reports on the exploration and exploitation of shale gas causing micro earthquakes – we have studies from Great Britain and the United States.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go on creating Europe without its citizens. The year 2013 will be the European Year of Citizens. This is good news. There is a lot at stake here, and we shall have to give ourselves the resources to enable us, in the difficult situation which the European Union is experiencing, faced with disaffection and lack of confidence, to turn the European Year of Citizens into Year One of European citizenship in everyday life. Our citizens are the reason for our presence here, and we must send them the message that Parliament and the European Union do not take citizens’ rights lightly, that they are at the heart of all the decisions that we take on a day-to-day basis. We need a campaign which matches the level of what is at stake. Savings in the budget must not be made on this aspect if we do not want the gulf between the Union and its citizens to become even wider. The action programme will have to be ambitious. The tools of participative democracy must be developed and distributed: petitions, access to the Ombudsman, European citizens’ initiatives, citizens’ forums, consultations, etc. I am sorry to say that our citizens fail to appreciate the rights and tools of participative democracy. In 2013, let us put our citizens back into the heart of our institutions and, in so doing, put Europe back into the heart of its Member States. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just got back from Hyderabad, in India, and the Eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity. Parliament was represented there alongside the Commission and the Council. The task facing this summit was an important one: to decide on financing for the biodiversity rescue plan 2010-2020 [sic
: 2011-2020], adopted two years ago at Nagoya. It was a close-run thing; the talks were difficult, but definite progress was made on maritime and coastal waters, and a commitment was secured to double the funding for biodiversity by 2015. After the disappointment of the Rio Summit, this comes as a relief. The European Union and the international community are still capable of imposing their will when it comes to the environment. But the critical state of biodiversity requires us to intensify our efforts and deliver on our commitments to preserve our natural world, here and now, in the budget, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. And soon we shall be debating measures against biopiracy and ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. I urge you to show a solid front and prove, once again, that the European Parliament seeks and feels a responsibility for biojustice at European and world level. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to say how delighted I am that we are having this discussion in this House just a few days after the Earth summit, which, as we have already heard, a number of you attended. It is time, I believe, to take stock and, most of all, to look forward. Taking stock is a simple matter: the results of this summit are disappointing. Forty years after the first Earth summit and 20 years after the commitments made in Rio, while we were expecting renewed impetus, a leap forward, the leaders of the international community were treading water. As to the future we want, the promise has not been kept and the commitments have been carried forward to 2015. The European Union set off for Rio with the ambition of sharing an action programme and we are returning with a work programme. Today, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, as well as the Member States, for the determination they have shown in the negotiations, and for embodying Europe’s ambitions in terms of the ecological transition of our economy, which we defined in this Parliament. Where do we go from here? Now, more than ever before, I am aware of the responsibility resting on our shoulders and the role that the European Union can play in promoting a new model of development to help us recover from the crisis. In Rio, we failed to set an example, and we did not provide any evidence that we were applying and following through with our ambitions in terms of sustainable development in all our European policies. What we now have to do is activate the transition at European level and at the level of the Member States. Without further ado, let us introduce innovative financing and implement the financial transaction tax and the environmental tax. Without further ado, let us initiate our energy transition so as to put an end to fossil fuels. Let us commit to the conservation of our marine and terrestrial resources. Let us get on with it! This will strengthen the credibility of the European Union and give it greater international weight. It will also enhance the prospects of the international human community for a better future. Let us resolutely commit ourselves, once again, right here and now, to the work programme adopted in Rio to accelerate change. Above all, let us also reaffirm our ambitions and try to make headway in the next two meetings in 2012: on biodiversity in Hyderabad and on climate in Doha. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, our Parliament will vote on the ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). It is because this treaty is a threat to public and digital liberties and to fundamental rights (freedom of expression, protection of personal data and private life), but also because it will lead to unacceptable restrictions in terms of information sharing in the fields of culture, agriculture, health and innovation to the benefit of certain groups, that we must reject ACTA. After three years of political and technical sparring, will our Parliament, the one and only direct representative of the European citizens, live up to the expectations and the trust of the thousands of citizens who have protested on the streets of Europe and inundated us with e-mails, the three million Europeans who have appealed to our Committee on Petitions, the citizens who elected us? Yes, by voting against ACTA and in favour of freedoms. Tomorrow, it is the citizens’ lobby which must win in order to say ‘Bye bye ACTA, welcome democracy!’. Welcome European democracy and citizens’ democracy. Welcome to the 21st century and the digital age. Our choice, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is political, and it is a rejection of the world proposed to us by ACTA. Sandrine Bélier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Seeber. This report provides a clear overview of the issues surrounding implementation of water legislation, in particular, and also gives a very good insight into possible solutions, especially in terms of more widely applicable, cohesive policies for this vital resource and its preservation. Among the report’s positive elements, and one that we must address as a matter of urgency, is its reaffirmation that water is a shared resource of humankind and that an integrated approach is needed. It also emphasises the duty of moderation of all sectors and all users in every EU country in their use of water, and calls once again for an objective assessment and urgent review – and perhaps even the phasing out – of all public subsidies and funding that are harmful to the preservation of water quality. I regret the fact that the report does not place enough emphasis on the urgency of reducing urban, industrial and agricultural diffuse pollution by all possible means. We still need to make a greater commitment to protecting aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, through regulatory oversight of our soils, among other things, so that eventually, we will achieve ‘good status’ throughout the European Union, as unfortunately, this will not be achieved by 2015. We have tools that we must develop and harmonise, but above all, we have objectives that we must meet without delay. All we need to do now is to put them into practice. We are counting on the European Commission to make sure this happens. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work. This report proposes a new strategy to 2020 to combat biodiversity loss, the pace of which, as has been pointed out, is continuing to accelerate dangerously. It aims to remind us of the extent to which our systems and our future are intimately linked to the conservation of our natural and genetic capital – for our food, our health and the fight against climate change – and it highlights the extent to which our future economic development is linked to our ability to conserve biodiversity. Let us remind ourselves that, each year, we are losing 3% of global GDP due to biodiversity loss, that the costs of inaction are far higher than the necessary investment costs and are not simply financial and that urgent measures are needed before the cost becomes too high and the loan taken out can no longer be repaid. Our report calls for two immediate measures: the development of innovative financial mechanisms and the elimination of all environmentally harmful public subsidies. However, this report also insists on the need to enshrine our development strategies in a medium and long-term vision and to place the challenges of preserving biodiversity at the heart of our sectoral policies and, first and foremost, at the heart of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the forestry policy. If this dimension of integration and ambitious commitments were to disappear from the text during today’s vote, we would be depriving ourselves of one of the main levers for action, and my group would not be able to vote for this report. Furthermore, I call on my conservative colleagues not to reject the unblocking of the framework directive on soil protection. Today, 48% of European soil is heavily degraded. This degradation has a cost estimated by the Commission at just under EUR 40 billion annually. Only ambitious action taken at European level can save us from this infernal spiral of the artificial development and sterilisation of our land. Finally, it is because we need to learn from our past mistakes and look to the future, and beyond Europe, that we have also introduced a reference to the next Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. Meanwhile, this report is one of the key stages of our determination and of the role of the European Union to succeed where yesterday we failed. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have one minute to call your attention to the ACTA treaty, an international anti-counterfeiting treaty which is not limited to counterfeiting. Patents and online activity are clearly included in the text in unacceptable conditions. Last Saturday, tens of thousands of people protested throughout Europe. More than two million citizens signed a petition against the treaty. Several governments are stepping back — Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia — in the name of defending civil rights. Germany has withheld its decision while it waits to hear the European Parliament’s position. Nineteen Sakharov Prize laureates and several NGOs have expressed their opposition. However, the European Commission is turning a blind eye and trying to force the treaty through. Today, I am launching an appeal to the representatives of the European people from all of the parties within this Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are relying on us to ensure the respect and protection of freedom of expression, freedom of information, access to generic medicines, personal data and details about their private lives, all of which are threatened by this treaty. They are relying on us to defend their freedoms and their fundamental rights and to block ACTA, as it has been presented to us in its current state. We must not disappoint them, we must be demanding and say no, vote against ACTA. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, this European Parliament resolution on the neutrality of the Internet shows our capacity to play a concrete role in the transformation from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. Ensuring that fundamental rights are respected in this new economy is crucial from all points of view. We are therefore delighted with the spirit of this resolution, which considers the Internet as a new area of democracy and which points out the importance of ensuring respect for fundamental rights related to or dependent on the web’s neutrality, such as freedom of expression, the protection of private data and media pluralism. It also highlights the importance of ensuring respect for values such as the sharing of and access to knowledge for the greatest number of people and of allowing no exceptions in the application of legal proceedings that enforce the respect of these rights. We hope that this resolution will lead us towards the recognition and enshrinement of the right to Internet access in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Finally, we also hope that this resolution will find support within the Commission and the Council so as to strengthen the European regulatory framework, and in particular, its application in all of the Member States to truly ensure an open and free Internet for every European citizen.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the context in which preparations are taking place for the fourth Earth Summit is difficult. It is incumbent upon us, of course, to tackle the financial and economic crisis in the euro area. However, one crisis does not chase away another and they are often linked. Indeed, the debt crisis does not affect only Greece and European finances. The crisis is not just financial. It is also a social and ecological crisis, which has to be brought to an end. Today, we are running an ecological deficit. We began to eat into our credit forty years ago and the debt has been growing ever since. Inequalities are getting worse, assaults on mother nature are mounting every year, with imbalances in the weather system, deforestation, collapsing fish stocks and loss of biodiversity being the most flagrant signs. There is only one solution for humanity: it must settle its debt. For this to happen, it behoves the policy makers of this world to act in solidarity, now, in 2012, not in 10 years’ time. I believe that the European Union has a crucial role to play and that the fourth Earth Summit in Rio in June 2012 is the ideal framework for making further commitments, for changing our economic development models, and for moving towards a new green economy. Let us say ‘yes’ to an economy that consumes fewer resources, a fairer economy, an economy that is committed to ecological sustainability and social justice; ‘yes’ to new indicators going beyond GDP; ‘yes’ to the principle of bioconditionality; but ‘no’ to the commoditisation and privatisation of common assets; and ‘no’ to the reproduction of the models that have brought us to where we are today. Let us say ‘yes’ to an international status for environmental refugees; ‘yes to greater responsibility, justice and environmental democracy. We, elected representatives, 20 years later, what do we say to Severn Suzuki? What will our response be if another child stands up in Rio in June 2012 and expresses her fear of the future, her inability to understand the inequalities that exist across the world and implores us to act before it is too late? The resolution we will vote on tomorrow is one of the elements of that response. This resolution, as adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is an ambitious, firm and responsible position, and I call on my fellow Members not to weaken it. I call on the Commission and the Council to give it the scope it deserves at the highest level for sustainable development on a global scale. (Applause) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to consider that the exact and original wording of paragraph 35 of the resolution, which is put to the vote and which stresses that corporate social responsibility should include biodiversity, is the French version, and that that should be the version used. Moreover, the word ‘social’, which has disappeared from the English version, should be reinserted and the version corrected. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitments made in 1992 in Rio and in 2002 in Johannesburg have not been respected. Our strategies for halting the loss of biodiversity have been a failure, and we know the reasons for this failure. The climate is changing, biodiversity is diminishing, and humanity must be determined to adapt itself more and more quickly, and in ways which are more and more difficult. In Nagoya, with a few weeks to go before Cancún, the European Union has the opportunity to argue in favour of adapting our economic development model to face up to the challenges of the 21st century. Climate deregulation, halting the loss of biodiversity and combating poverty: these three challenges, and the responses needed to face up to them, are intimately linked. We have the responsibility of proposing and introducing a new development model which is fairer, more equitable and more sustainable. So let us speak clearly and practically. Parliament’s resolution identifies three key challenges which now raise several questions about the Commission’s and the Council’s position. The first challenge, of course, is to start protecting and restoring biodiversity. This presupposes adequate financing, the withdrawal of all public aid which is harmful for biodiversity and a dedicated budget which we propose should be multiplied tenfold. However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same? The second challenge is the cost of biodiversity loss to society, which has only just begun to be evaluated. It is thought to be around 1% of global GDP, but this evaluation does not take into account the social, cultural, moral and scientific value of biodiversity. Is the European Union determined to resist the monetisation of living things? Is it determined to defend the common inheritance of humankind and to reaffirm that nature is priceless and is not for sale? Finally, the third challenge is to stop the pillaging of genetic resources by businesses and industries. One solution is to regulate access to genetic resources in a way which, in particular, respects fully the rights of indigenous and local communities. The European Union will still have a particular responsibility in these negotiations. As such, is it determined, firstly, to defend the principle of the non-patentability of life and, secondly, to support the repayment of the ecological debt to the countries of the South by supporting the retroactivity of the system which is to be adopted? Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been mentioned, it is the International Year of Biodiversity and, this year, we are being asked to commit ourselves to resolving a triple crisis. The three interconnected elements require a consistent and integrated approach if we are to tackle them and emerge from an ecological crisis that has direct repercussions for our economy and our social model. This triple crisis involves food security, climate change and loss of biodiversity. I should like to remind you that biodiversity has no price attached, but its loss, its decline and its destruction do have a cost which contributes to the increase in poverty and which engenders inequalities and considerable losses in economic, welfare and cultural terms. As has already been mentioned – and we now know it for sure – 40% of our world economy depends directly on services provided by nature, and 60% of these are in sharp decline. Europe has lost 30% of its biodiversity over the past 40 years. This loss is currently valued at 1% of the EU’s GDP – EUR 50 billion per year – and it might reach EUR 14 000 billion in 2050 if we do not take action, since the decline is accelerating and the causes of the failure of previous EU policies in this area are well known and are clearly set out in the report. The measures to be taken are also set out in the report. We are therefore hoping for a large vote in its favour, and we should like to thank Mrs de Lange for her work. We now have to move from words and intentions to deeds; from objectives to means. I find it difficult to hide several regrets: the lack of responsiveness on the part of the Council and of the Commission despite the need for urgent action; the regret that Soil Directive IV is still being blocked by the Council; the regret that bio-conditionality of all public financing was rejected by just one vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; and the regret that the challenges associated with biodiversity have not been more extensively incorporated in the EU 2020 strategy, so as to ensure a sustainable exit from the crisis through the greening of our economic model. There is a need for consistency. There is still time to understand and to commit ourselves to ensuring that our natural capital is preserved and enhanced. This is a winning investment for the future.

Madam President, France is the only Member State that did not anticipate the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and that is refusing to abide by the outcome of the European elections of June 2009. By accepting the third option – the French exception – of appointing two new MEPs, we are being asked to endorse a serious violation of the Union’s primary legislation: the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, from which we have derived our legitimacy for 31 years. Are we going to abide by the Council’s decision, under pressure from one Member State, which shows a certain lack of regard for the Union and the European citizens? Our Parliament must not sanction this serious breach of the principle of European democracy. We must refuse to undermine our legitimacy and our credibility as elected representatives of the European public. It is the European citizens who choose who they want to represent them in the European Parliament, not the governments of the Member States. This French exception justifies our demand for Parliament to be involved, in the case of a convention on the revision of the Treaties, and to reject any intergovernmental conference.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you touched on the subject of storm Xynthia, which has just struck Western Europe causing the deaths of almost 60 people and considerable material damage. I am extremely sad today, but also angry because this human catastrophe could have been avoided; at the least, its impacts could have been limited. Until recently in France and throughout Europe today, coastal areas and flood zones are being developed in spite of and in violation of current European, and indeed national, legislation. These are often Natura 2000 sites, and their protection from urbanisation is essential to limit the effects of similar natural events. It is up to us to demonstrate greater accountability, to make sure that Community regulations – in particular, the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive – are strictly applied by Member States, and to make the Structural Funds conditional on the requirements of sustainability, safety and biodiversity. The EU 2020 strategy is a unique opportunity to redefine our relationship with the environment. (The President cut off the speaker) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

I am sorry, Mr President. This is my first time, I checked that the procedure was correct and meanwhile … please accept my apologies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the year that the UN has declared the ‘International Year of Biodiversity’, I would like to draw your attention to the failure of the 2004-2010 European Strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity. 40% of our natural heritage is under threat. The state of biodiversity is a measure of the state of health of the planet, of the state of health of our development system, and the crisis phenomenon is accelerating. Therefore, I hope that, today and tomorrow, the European Union and the European Parliament will be able to rise to the challenges and come up with ambitious and wide-ranging objectives to halt the loss of biodiversity in all sectoral policies in 2010. We must act, there is still time, and 2010 is a year in which anything is possible. I hope we will be able to do better than we did in Copenhagen. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 November, Parliament was given the Council’s guarantee that any restrictions on internet access can only be made if certain conditions are met: prior, fair and impartial procedure; a guarantee of the principle of presumption of innocence and the respect for privacy; and respect for the European Convention on Human Rights. This agreement is the first step towards better protection for citizens faced with growing attempts made by certain States and private operators to trivialise the principle of flexible response, data storage and the control of digital exchange on the internet. That, however, is not enough. Accepting restrictions on digital freedoms and going against net neutrality is not acceptable. It is contrary to the Lisbon Strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the Union. As the sole directly elected European institution, in order to protect citizens’ interests, Parliament now has the moral and political duty to take up this issue and define the rights and duties of internet users so as to guarantee their digital freedom and access to knowledge. We will vote in favour of this text, but we will make sure that we take the matter further tomorrow. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot address the Presidency, since it is not here. We spend our time, in our constituencies and our countries, defending Europe, saying: ‘There will be no way out of the crisis without Europe!’. Europe is complicated: it is made up of 27 states, soon to be 28, and it is always extremely difficult to come to and implement European decisions quickly. Forgive me, Commissioner, but when I listen to you, I think: ‘I hope workers in the photovoltaic sector are not watching the video of your speech!’, because they are going to say to themselves: ‘Is this the Europe that is supposed to be protecting me?’. For years, we have been told that the fight against climate change, renewable energy objectives, green industry and the green economy would be pillars of European growth and the European economy. Today, what are we seeing? We are seeing European institutions that are, in part, petrified by China, and which are taking months and months to potentially react or take provisional measures. How can we justify to these workers, and to all those who are fighting for Europe to protect industry and protect workers, the fact that the United States have, in the space of a few weeks, taken strong measures, imposing import tariffs of up to 250 %, while in Europe, we finally got around to opening an investigation in September and may have provisional measures by July, or failing that, by the end of the year? It is true that First Solar
 has already closed its sites in Germany; it is true that the news about Q Cells
 is now history. How many small and medium-sized enterprises are in difficulty today, however? Even if they do not make it into the news, they are in difficulty. Thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs are under threat. So, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee, we urge you to accelerate the process of introducing provisional measures. Europe was a leader, with ambitious goals on renewable energy and a strong renewable energy industry working alongside it. Today, we are losing that industry, while a real trade war is taking place between the United States and China in the strategic sector of renewable energy, which is so crucial to our competitiveness and our future energy policy. It seems that today, the European Union has once again opted to wait indefinitely. At this rate, the decision will be taken by default. When there is no European photovoltaic industry left, there will no longer be any point in taking measures: you will be able to rest at ease!

 Thank you, Mr Caspary, for your question, which gives me the opportunity to continue to elaborate on this subject. I find it extremely compelling that the entire Committee on International Trade – which is hardly known for its protectionism – is, through this probing oral question, calling on the Commission to go faster. It is not entirely insignificant that it should be a German coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and a German coordinator of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who are now saying that measures must be taken, while Germany has regularly said: ‘Let us avoid any problems with China, let us avoid any trade war with China!’. The European Parliament is therefore united, Commissioner, in calling on you to accelerate the procedures. We must save these jobs. We must do as China and the United States have done and finally endow ourselves with an industrial policy that defends itself through trade instruments. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, if the world warmed by 4°C we would see a torrent of disasters, including extreme heat waves, a reduction in food stocks and a rise in sea level, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Those words are not taken from the Doha briefing brochure of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, as you know, from the World Bank report, which also states that the fight against global warming is an economic opportunity. However, it seems that the international negotiations are not making any headway and are waiting for 2015. We must obviously avoid what led to the Copenhagen failure: trying to reach an agreement right before the end of Copenhagen and not preparing it adequately beforehand. Doha is an extremely important meeting. It seems that conservatism of all kinds is taking precedence over the urgency and the new economy, especially this new carbon-free economy, so the European Union needs to set an example. Here, once again, the Union seems to be dragging its feet: when it comes to aviation, climate change caused by agrofuels, the restriction on the coal market and ‘hot air’, the European Union’s most recent decisions have been bad decisions. We know that you are ambitious, Commissioner. We need to be ambitious in Doha and we need to continue to try to convince your colleagues in the Commission and us in the European Parliament to ensure that Europe continues to lead the way.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we sometimes see astonishing things in this Parliament. When we talk about human rights in China, we hear people say: ‘we need to do business with China because that will encourage respect for human rights in China’. When revolutions happen in Arab countries, we hear people say: ‘we must organise free trade agreements with the Arab countries because that is how we can support the emergence of democracy in the Arab countries’. All of a sudden, trade becomes a purely technical, and highly complicated, issue that has no connection with politics. We know, unfortunately, that this agreement does not guarantee the origin of the products that will enter the European market: firstly, pharmaceutical products and then other industrial products. Not even a week ago, Mr Netanyahu’s Government announced the legalisation of unauthorised settlements and the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank, and all this with an eye on the election on 22 January. At a time when Europe is going to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of its past and, above all, the history it must build, particularly with its neighbours, it would be an aberration for Europe to send out a message that it is upgrading its political relations with Israel, rewarding the Netanyahu Administration for all of its politics, which are constantly criticised by the EU bodies, especially Baroness Ashton. What we are doing here is sending a message to Israel: ‘you must vote for Mr Netanyahu so that he continues his settlement policy, his policy of infringing human rights’. We are in favour of referring the report back to committee for all of the reasons that Mr Moreira gave. It is crucial that Europe does not get involved in the Israeli elections and does not send a message of support to Mr Netanyahu.

As you know, it is extremely difficult to trace the origin of all of the products that come from Israel. Therefore, even if there is no definitive proof today that pharmaceutical products are produced in certain territories, that does not mean that that will be the case in the future, especially when there is a desire to expand the settlements and there may be other industrial products that would not offer a guarantee that they are not manufactured in the Occupied Territories. Sir, do not hesitate to look at the voting list of the Greens for every vote we hold on trade agreements: you will see that we are consistent with regard to respect for human rights, the environment and social rights.

 Mr President, tomorrow, Parliament should reject the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). This is good news for democracy, because it sanctions a negotiation process which has chosen confidentiality and opacity over transparency and the involvement of Parliament. I know that it is not your fault, Commissioner. This is good news for democracy, because Parliament will choose culture, agriculture, health and communication over large industrial groups. I am shocked to hear that certain Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believe that the general interest is that of large industrial groups and not that of citizens when they become involved in a social issue. This is good news for democracy, because millions of citizens have taken to the streets and have held a large-scale social debate, and I am happy that some MEPs in this Chamber have changed their minds in favour of democracy. Lastly, this is good news for democracy, because we will finally have, within our European societies, a debate on the balance between public freedom and information sharing, on the one hand, and fair remuneration for creativity and innovation, on the other.

Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that someone is taking notes for the Danish Presidency. We also share the positive view on this resolution. It is extremely important for us that the Council be able to hear the voice of Parliament on the mandate. I believe that the institutional agreement framework is clear. It is not a binding opinion but, in view of both the economic and social crises, and the trade deficits that we have in Europe, it is absolutely essential to get trade agreements and the content of the negotiations right. For that reason, should it happen, for once, that the Council listens to what Parliament has to say before establishing the negotiating mandate, I think that we could take a step forward in terms of the quality of the agreements that we can approve. I think that recent experience, including the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), shows that from a policy standpoint, it would be wise to listen to what Parliament has to say before entering into negotiations. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is not a question of obtaining, pre-negotiation, concessions from the Japanese, as certain groups understand it. We are simply saying: let us have a transparent negotiation process that is clear, and thereby not enter into several negotiation processes at the same time. Let us have a clear mandate with which we can start negotiations. That also raises some questions. Conducting negotiations with Japan and with the United States also raises some questions. In our Committee on International Trade, we have, on several occasions, had discussions with Pascal Lamy and today this process marks a break. Entering into negotiations with a large trade bloc such as Japan or the United States marks a break in the European position and, as such, puts to one side, or takes note of, the failed negotiations that took place in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must take greater consideration of the consequences of these negotiations, in particular, when they primarily concern the regulatory system, investments, public markets, and all of the regulatory frameworks rather than tariffs. We must consider what bilateral negotiations signify as opposed to multilateral negotiations. Then, Commissioner, you said that 90%, I believe, of the growth – this is your figure – will take place outside of Europe. I am not sure that Japan is the most dynamic area right now, but to benefit further from this international growth means being able to sell, which entails having a strategic vision of our economy and our industrial sector. Once again, I regret the fact that we have some 20 trade negotiations ongoing around the world without having an industrial policy, without knowing what we want for our economy, for example, for our automotive industry over the next 20 years.

 I have a quick question for Mr Caspary: is it already the case that despite the conditions that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) imposed with regard to concluding an agreement, it has already voted against a free trade agreement? Now a subsidiary question: does Mr Caspary recall a single impact assessment concerning the implementation of a free trade agreement which can confirm all the benefits which were announced when the free trade agreement was negotiated, be they social or economic benefits? Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, it goes without saying that failing to comply with social and environmental standards and human rights also creates an imbalance between the EU and China. However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States. Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries. Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy. In Europe, we try to have both targets for renewable energy and, until recently, a renewable energy industry. China has launched a price war on renewable energy and, in particular, photovoltaics. Through subsidies, it has developed production overcapacity that is killing off the European photovoltaic industry. This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not? Thousands of jobs are currently being lost, which is why we call on the European Commission to come back to Parliament with an analysis of China’s strategy in the photovoltaic market and whether the US response is the right way to go. We clearly want to be thinking along these lines. We cannot be defending our targets for renewable energy without defending the European renewable energy industry. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, you mentioned the European legislation on CO2 
emissions from cars. This was already one of the Commission’s initiatives in 1995. Yet, faced with the lobby by large car manufacturers, what should have been achieved in 2005 will not be achieved until 2015. I would like it if, at some point, democracy were allowed to function and citizens were able to see the transparency of what is being debated in Parliament, because those on the conservative benches who claim to protect the citizens are today abandoning them in the face of rocketing fuel bills. They are abandoning the workers in the face of the relocation of an industry that has failed to innovate and that has left our territories. They are abandoning the citizens of the whole world in the face of climate change. Yes, we find ourselves in a complicated situation. We are facing a twofold problem. Firstly, we have governments that seem incapable of changing their software, incapable of imagining an economic model that is anything other than household debt, State debt or climate debt. Then, we are seeing lobbies in this situation that are stepping into the breach of this conservatism. Nuclear energy, carbon sequestration, oil sands and shale gas lobbyists are trying to take advantage of this political indecision. Ms Hedegaard, your Roadmap is not perfect, Mr Davies’ report is not perfect, but it would be irresponsible of Parliament to validate the complete irresponsibility of Poland.

 Mr Helmer, could you confirm that in Great Britain, EDF, E.ON and RWE are in the process of negotiating a feed-in tariff for nuclear energy of nine to 12 cents per kWh, a price that is currently higher than that of onshore wind energy, which is seven cents per kWh? Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you; you managed to avert disaster in Durban. You managed to put across the idea that there is a suitable framework for negotiations but, on the other hand, nothing has actually been triggered to stem climate change. With the notable exception of Poland, you gained the support of Member States to champion these negotiations but you know, unfortunately, you do not have the same consensus from Member States to implement an ambitious climate policy. What I propose, Commissioner, is that DG CLIMA, which you run, makes its contribution to getting Europe out of the crisis, by explaining how an ambitious climate policy could significantly help us get out of the crisis through energy efficiency, through energy savings, through renewable energy, through innovation in technology. Maybe then we would have a document which would allow us to fight – us in the Member States, you at European level –so that the old economy loosens its grip on our political leaders and the new economy may finally emerge.

 Mr President, it is very good of you to give me the floor. I had not planned to speak. I should just like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the teams who worked on this issue.

 Madam President, Commissioner, some of us were in Doha when we launched the Doha Round. We are well aware that the Round was, in a way, stillborn: it had so many contradictions in its genes that it could not succeed, but it was the international situation – it was just after 11 September – that ultimately forced all the countries to sign in Doha. What we are seeing above all today is not a crisis of confidence within the international community, but a crisis of globalisation. We need to stop thinking about ever more liberalisation and focus instead, of course, on regulation, in a world in which every one of us today can see the damage caused by the globalisation of trade, whether it be from an environmental point of view or from a social point of view. What kind of economy does Europe want to create for itself? How can we put a stop to environmental, social, fiscal and monetary dumping? How can we ensure that people can exercise their trade union freedom throughout the world without restriction? How can Europe make global trade dependent on the recognition and exercise of trade union freedom? These are the questions that we need to be asking ourselves today, that Europe needs to ask itself when it operates within a multilateral framework. We must acknowledge that the Doha Round is finished, adopt a package that is limited and restricted to the least developed countries and, above all, launch an ambitious and transparent process for reforming the World Trade Organisation, one that guarantees the fair participation of all stakeholders and safeguards the interests of the weakest countries in particular, that makes trade law subject to social legislation, environmental law and, of course, human rights, and that actually promotes a multilateral regulatory agenda that puts globalisation back where it belongs. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, you are not being attacked personally in this matter, Commissioner, but you must understand that we are extremely disappointed that the Commission has given in so easily to pressure from some Member States, and France in particular. So we do indeed want to phase out nuclear power because we believe that this is the only way to eliminate the nuclear risk. In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years. We want to have real tests, and we cannot accept the fact that France has been successful in allowing the risky option to go forward. The tests do not predict airplane crashes, either over fuel ponds or over reactors. Neither do they predict terrorist attacks. We refuse to accept the fact that the tests applied at European level have become a communications exercise by a crisis unit for the nuclear industry, which Mr Sarkozy will showcase at the next G8 in order to sell even more European pressurised water reactors (PWRs). That is what we cannot accept, Commissioner. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Indeed, Mr Liese, this resolution was co-signed, and I would also like to respond to Mrs del Castillo Vera who said that the French public is in favour of nuclear energy. That is not true. All the surveys show that 77% of French people want to move away from nuclear energy, but in France we cannot have that debate. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact the first major Free Trade Agreement that Europe has passed for some years, and when it comes to free trade agreements, it must be said that you do not lack ambition – South Korea, Canada, India, Mercosur. There is not a single country or area that escapes the European Commission’s ambitions where free trade agreements are concerned. In the case of this agreement, we have seen that there will only be winners, but I still wonder who the winners will be when I am told that they will be in the agricultural sector. As the elected representative of Brittany, I can tell you that in in that region which produces more than 60% of French pigmeat, the few benefits to be had by the agri-food product firms do not compensate for reductions in tourism, degradation of the environment and the health of workers, and farmers’ losses. There are, indeed, also a great number of losers, and do we, here, have a vision of what economic and social Europe will be like after all these free trade agreements have been signed? No we do not, and nor do we know, at the end of the day, whether there will be any industrial or economic sector left to benefit from these free trade agreements. Moreover, and most importantly, Commissioner, try as you might to tell us that we are not questioning South Korea’s environmental and climate policy, that is not true. We are going to be able to export enormous saloon cars, those cars of which the manufacturers who make the least amount of effort to combat climate change are rewarded by this agreement. For the first time, the European Union is questioning the climate policy of one of its trading partners. Has the European Commission started to change, under pressure from Canada, its directive on fuel quality? We believe that we are putting Europe’s ambitions in the wrong order: the environment and the climate must come before trade. That is why our group will vote against this agreement. Yannick Jadot,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at this early stage, to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue, which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements. The subject is an important one. As you all know, the forest is receding. Every two seconds, across the world, the equivalent of a football pitch is destroyed; within a year, an area the size of Greece is deforested. Clearly, this is a tragic situation. It is tragic from the point of view of diversity: a few thousand plant and animal species are threatened, and the forests which are most affected – tropical forests – contain half of the world’s biodiversity. It is obviously tragic, too, from the point of view of climate change: deforestation is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, deforestation puts some hundreds of millions of people in danger – people who either live in the forests or live off them. Forest exploitation and the forestry industry are among the principal causes of deforestation, particularly in the area on which we are focusing today: the Congo basin. It is estimated that 20 to 40% of the timber felled and exchanged in the world is illegal timber. The issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one. These voluntary partnership agreements have been approved in the context of the approval procedure within the Committee on International Trade. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this procedure allows the European Parliament to express its view. At the same time, however, it can only say yes or no. Hence, this debate is extremely important because it allows us to go into more detail, and it allows you, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, to respond to the questions that Parliament is putting to you. These agreements are important; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber. They also put in place independent verification procedures, and supplement forest policies and governance in the countries concerned. Today, we are talking about the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. However, I would like to make an initial point before going into these agreements and Parliament’s questions: we really must differentiate between legal timber and sustainable timber. Obviously, we are dealing with the legality of timber here, but legal timber does not necessarily mean sustainable forest exploitation. Therefore, the first general question that I would ask the Commission is: how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests – 2011 is the International Year of Forests – while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún, in particular, on the REDD+ mechanism, and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated, which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber? Next, we are still waiting for an answer from the European Commission on the question of biofuels and indirect changes in land use. As you know, Parliament has asked you to integrate these issues into the criteria for evaluating the sustainability of biofuels. More specifically, concerning the voluntary partnership agreements, there are many positive elements: we greatly appreciated the negotiation efforts and, in particular, the involvement of members of civil society in Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. We know that it is not easy and, from this point of view, these voluntary partnership agreements seemed to be a success. As I was saying just now, however, a number of questions and requests remain. Commissioner, are you ready to come, for example, every six months, or six months after the signing of an agreement, to update us on the implementation of the agreement? I ask because it is clear that the negotiation and the implementation of the agreement may be of a very different quality. We would therefore like you to come and tell us if the parties concerned, in particular, the members of civil society, continue to be involved in its implementation. In countries in which it is still not easy to complain, particularly when corruption exists, have complaint mechanisms been provided for – in particular, independent ones – so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to? In the same way, we would like you to regularly report on the impacts of the implementation of these agreements, so that you can tell us where we have got to with them, both in terms of the overall consistency of the Commission’s actions on forests, and in terms of their specific implementation on the issue of the legality of timber. Lastly, a final point: you claim that there is no budget in these agreements. Yet we will obviously need budgets to support these policies, so can you clarify the budgetary issue in relation to these voluntary partnership agreements? Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, once again, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. I believe that we have almost all spoken in the same terms: making this essential point about VPAs, which provide the link between development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society. I believe that, if there is one tool that we can use today to bring about sustainable development in these countries, particularly the African countries, it is undoubtedly the strengthening of civil society. As long as the only or the main expression of democracy in those countries is the vote to elect the President, then as we have seen – as the history of Côte d’Ivoire unfortunately reminds us – we will not make sufficient progress. Therefore, strengthening civil society – the fact that it plays a constant role in the implementation of these agreements, in the monitoring of forest exploitation, in the discussion on the conditions of this exploitation and in the sharing of revenues linked to this forest exploitation – is essential. It is through this strengthening of civil society, too, that we will respond best to the argument that we often hear concerning China: ‘Why should we meet the criteria for strong cooperation with Europe – social, democratic and environmental criteria – when China makes a mockery of them in terms of corruption and pillaging?’ Well, strengthening civil society is the best defence against this system which China, in particular, is trying to impose on the countries of the South. Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also – and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry – a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries. Thank you for your desire to work with the European Parliament. We are very happy about this future collaboration. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, like Mr Leinen, I wanted to emphasise the remarkable work that Commissioner Hedegaard and her team carried out in Cancún. Today, in a way, the success of Cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that, if the others take no action, we will take no action. The positive aspect of Cancún is that everyone must now engage with the machine of international negotiation, in particular, by strengthening their national or regional objectives. In terms of the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Europe now has to reach 30%. Reaching 30% is part of the objective of obtaining a decarbonised economy by 2050; 20% will not allow us to make this transition. Finally, in reaching 30%, we will also clearly be linking up now with the emerging economies: Brazil, China and South Africa. We know that these countries have some objectives which, up to a point, are currently superior to those of the European Union. We must therefore put a stop to inaction and the strategy of the status quo. The success of Cancún means that we must engage with the process of international negotiation in a much more constructive manner. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and, in principle, clearly, to support the adoption tomorrow of the report adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Let us come now to the unbelievable potential associated with energy savings, a point that has been made here. Reports from the European Commission itself say that if we called a halt to our excessive energy consumption, if we reduced our energy wastage by 20%, we could create one million jobs, we could save almost EUR 1 000 per European household, and we could clearly reduce our external energy bill. A 20% energy saving or reduction in Europe is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos in energy terms, and we are currently missing that target. Mrs Hall made this point, and the way I see it, we have trouble calculating. If reports show today that we are far from achieving 20%, then we can evaluate the savings that we make or do not make each year. We also know that this eco-design or eco-labelling approach for cars and so on does not result in overall coherence and does enable us to obtain the results that we are seeking. I am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here. Excuse me, Commissioner, but when you say that we have a problem in defining energy efficiency, this is perhaps true from a theoretical point of view, but the climate and energy package is very clear on the objective. It says that energy consumption must be reduced by 20% below the baseline level. This problem does not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency. There are energy levels that we need to return to – that is what the climate and energy package says. We are told that we do not need a binding objective. We are thus making one on renewables. A few days ago, in Cancún, the European Commission negotiated a binding agreement on climate change and tried to defend the Kyoto Protocol, and in this House we are citing the arguments of the United States and China by saying: ‘We will go for voluntary targets, and then, if one day we realise that they are not working, we will create binding targets’. With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building. There is scope to take a large-scale European initiative on building, which nevertheless accounts for 40% of our energy consumption; we can go much further on renovation. Finally, citizens are today facing the cold. They are paying very high prices for their energy. If Europe emerges from the crisis, energy will be much more expensive internationally. Citizens will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy prices. We must move much more quickly, and I would also ask you, Commissioner, to please stress to Mr Van Rompuy that the 4 February meeting should also be a meeting about energy consumption. From this point of view, the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, we propose changing the end of paragraph 22 by replacing ‘prevent’ with ‘inform’, so the final phrase becomes:  ‘reiterates also Parliament’s request to the Commission and Member States to inform the European Parliament about loans granted by export credit agencies and the European Investment Bank to projects that have a negative impact on the climate’. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could have limited my speech to simply recalling the images of this summer in Russia or southern Asia, to reminding you of the absolutely urgent need to combat climate change and, since we are talking about Europe, to move immediately, or as soon as we possibly can, to a target of 30% by 2020 for greenhouse gas emissions. Today, if we make no changes, we shall reach 19%. We have practically already reached the target that we set ourselves, so we can no longer speak of European ambition if we speak of 20%. As far as I am concerned, I am not an obvious admirer of the carbon market, but if we stay at 20%, we can be sure that we shall be treating the carbon market as a species in danger of extinction and not as a lever in the fight against climate change. Moving to 30% would potentially raise EUR 8 billion for European budgets by auctioning quotas. We know 30% is possible. In particular, a binding 20% energy efficiency target would mean a million European jobs. This represents savings of EUR 1 000 per household in Europe and, since Commissioner Oettinger mentioned Nabucco, it is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos. Are we then going to kill off European businesses if we move to 30%? Obviously not. Every study shows this to be so. Some sectors potentially at risk are affected, but the means exist, and until now, the sectors that threaten Europe with extinction are the sectors that have been the beneficiaries of European energy policy. They have gained billions of euros thanks to European climate policy. Moving to 30% would mean clearly siding with those who are bringing about change, siding with those who are making tomorrow’s world. I should also like to cite some figures. According to the Ernst &amp; Young 2010 Barometer, China and the United States are the most attractive countries for the development of renewable energy. According to a recent study, only three of the 50 businesses identified as world leaders in green technology are located in Europe; the others are in Asia or the United States. It is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30%, and I shall conclude by echoing the words of Barack Obama when he said that we could abandon the jobs of the future to our competitors or we could seize the opportunity of the century, as they have already begun to do. The nation that pioneers the energy of the future would be the pioneer nation of the 21st century, he said. He lost the elections. Let us take up this leadership in energy transition and the new economy. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, just as the European Union is trying to redefine its trade policy after the Treaty of Lisbon, while at the same time trying to reconcile it with its industrial policy, the fact that this Parliament is simultaneously debating three reports that address issues ultimately falling within the same political and public debate on ‘what is trade and how can it be reconciled with social, environmental and human rights issues?’ is to be welcomed. In fact, we are ultimately in a state of permanent schizophrenia: everywhere, companies are relocating, social rights are being called into question, environmental degradation is increasing and, at the same time, we are negotiating free trade agreements, we are negotiating within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a whole series of measures which, unfortunately, are totally out of step with the public debate in which our citizens are trying to engage. How can we explain to our public today that a football entering the European market produced under decent working conditions, where the environment is respected, and a football produced by child labour or in a country where trade unions are prohibited is the same football? We cannot explain this to our public. Our responsibility today is therefore to integrate these environmental and social issues into trade. Regarding my report more specifically, with respect to trade there are currently a number of European countries whose imports of products largely offset the reductions in their own emissions. A third of Europe’s emissions are not produced in Europe but correspond to imported goods. It is therefore essential to integrate the climate issue into our trade policies. How can we explain to our public that, at the same time as concluding a free trade agreement which will potentially lead to deforestation, we are going to Cancún to negotiate a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) agreement aimed at providing financial compensation for non-deforestation in the countries of the South? It is therefore essential to reconcile these different issues. When we drafted this report – and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups – we tried to be as constructive as possible. I hope this will be reflected in the vote tomorrow. We also tried to put an end to black or white debates. We no longer say that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100% of our industries in Europe, where, in a way, we do not care, because the climate issue must take precedence. When we worked on the issue of carbon leakage, for example, we always tried to specify which sector of activity might be put at risk and which tools could be developed to protect that sector. The same is true for the laws governing the framework for the anti-dumping discussion at the WTO. The same is true for production processes and methods. On all these issues, we tried, with the other groups, to come up with proposals to move things forward, and I believe that we have come up with concrete proposals that are commensurate with our ambitions, with the mandate of the European Commission and of all the European institutions. I would just say once again that I hope that the cooperative, constructive spirit in which we drafted this report will be reflected in the vote tomorrow and, once again, I would like to thank all my colleagues for the work they have done. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Commissioner De Gucht for his answers and for his proposal for work. I have taken note of his reply on the climate chapter, and I hope that we will also manage to work on the remaining aspects and make proposals that will result in concrete action being taken and certain elements being included in the trade agreements. Finally, the fact that the trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, which are undoubtedly very complex, have broken down also offers the European Union various opportunities to integrate more innovative elements into bilateral agreements and to try to construct new types of trade agreements which further integrate the EU’s objectives with regard to the environment, climate, human rights or social rights. This is therefore, in a sense, an opportunity. I believe it is a very strong request, and if these reports receive broad support tomorrow, this will indeed be – and I want to believe it will be – an extremely important signal from the European Parliament to the Commission and to the Council. I would like to reply to Mrs Stassen, who has left, regarding the economy. Books on the economy have continued to be written after the 19th century. We can therefore see that the challenges concerning the way in which to integrate social and environmental issues into production costs are an important factor in terms of defining the reality of comparative advantages. Similarly, Mrs Muscardini, you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the European Union. Moreover, if you are prepared, with me and others, to combat the Blair House Agreement, which is, after all, the main obstacle to real food sovereignty, to real food security today in Europe, you will have my support. Thank you, therefore, to all my colleagues, and to you, Commissioner, for your openness towards concrete work and concrete action with a view to the agreements that will soon be negotiated and concluded. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioners, I think we must note the convergence of this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and its Committee on International Trade on this matter and on the proposals presented in connection with it. It has been said that fishing is an extremely important sector for spatial planning, employment and cultural identity in Europe. It is also a sector which has an extremely strong impact on fisheries resources, and today a great majority of stocks are considerably overfished. Too often people would have us believe that the ultimate objective of a European common fisheries policy is to adapt the fisheries sector to globalised trade in fishery products, the extremely harsh effects of which we can see today, whether it be socially, economically or, of course, environmentally. We therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products. We support the idea of withdrawing fishery products from non-agricultural market access (NAMA) rules, because a fish is not a sock or a washing machine, it is absolutely crucial to food security and biodiversity. However, we must be clear. Since we are bringing this into international negotiations, our European policy must be exemplary and we must move in the direction of having more and better paid fishermen who do not overexploit fish stocks, either in our territorial waters or in those in which we buy fishing rights.

Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment, deleting two parts of the amendment, namely the words ‘by the Colombian army’ and ‘on Colombia’. Therefore, the amendment reads as follows: ‘considers that the alarming news concerning the killings of trade unionists in Colombia, as well as the news recently received and now confirmed by Colombia’s public prosecutor that mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in recent years have been discovered in the region of La Macarena, are sufficient evidence to enable the Commission to open an investigation in accordance with the regulation.’ Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, during the night of 27 to 28 February, storm Xynthia hit western France particularly hard, claiming many lives. Naturally, our thoughts are with the victims and all those who mobilised to help them. We are calling very clearly for the European Commission to make the Solidarity Fund available quickly in order to help the most affected people. However, we must also learn lessons from this tragedy. How is it possible that there are between five and six million people in France living in flood zones? There is obviously pressure from the property lobby, but it is also true that a few months ago, President Sarkozy was calling for construction in flood zones to be permitted. Responsibilities therefore lie with politicians. We are calling for all European cofinancing linked to reconstruction and restoration to be conditional on respect for the law: coastal law and prevention plans relating to flood risk. Naturally, we are also asking once again that we show swift support for all the worst affected sectors, in particular shellfish farming. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Commissioner, it is good that you want to debate the result of this tool before the European Parliament, but the main thing to respect with regard to the European Parliament is the ordinary legislative procedure. We will find this tool useful, but it could be more operational, more effective and more transparent. More effective, in particular, if it took into account all the decentralised energy sources. It is not a matter of counting every single solar panel, but at Member State level we have information that you could gather to see what all the plans for decentralised energy add up to. When we are talking about democracy and transparency, I am surprised to hear our Liberal fellow Member reply ‘bureaucracy’. This instrument must be transparent, it must be debated, and the Commission must consult all the stakeholders, unions and associations, among others. Finally, taxpayers are contributing a great deal to the energy transition effort, and it is important that we have information on funding, to know exactly how taxpayers are funding energy transition in Europe. I hope that the amendments that have been tabled will be adopted by a large number of Members tomorrow, by more than there are here this evening. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis-related protectionism into its proper context. I think that, in the context of a debate, it is wise of you to point out that a world war linked to the revival of protectionism is not about to break out. Now, I almost want to reverse the issue. For me, the issue is not ultimately about what effects the economic crisis has on trade, but more fundamentally about what effects trade, and specifically the trade policies undertaken for 20 years, have on the crisis we are experiencing today. In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets. In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us. I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it. It follows that, in all the national debates – and, as a key figure on the Belgian scene, you will know this – all the political parties are now discovering that it is impossible, in a globalised world, to manage social dumping, environmental dumping, monetary dumping and fiscal dumping. Similarly, we might consider that the strategy that all us Europeans expected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was to say ‘social democracy will come about through trade’, is not working, as we can see with the example of China. Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure. Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have. Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world? Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure. I have a more specific question: on 4 February 2010, a meeting of the WTO’s Committee on Trade in Financial Services was held, and it focused specifically on the challenges presented by the financial crisis and the liberalisation of financial services. Can you tell us what the outcome of that meeting was and what your opinion is on this matter, if you were able to follow it? Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, as you said, this agreement breaks new ground. It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it. Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties. It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship. Secondly, this agreement also breaks new ground because, in trade negotiations, it is usually the farming sectors that resist and the industrial sectors that are satisfied. In this case, we see that the opposite is true. For the first time, it is literally major industrial sectors that are complaining about the decisions made by Europe. Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market. Just what do these figures mean, however? I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany. If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem. Now, we are told that we shall earn a small amount of money from pigs by trading with South Korea. The reality, in the region I represent, is that this intensification of pig farming leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of added value, a loss of tourism and, consequently, in my region, we are the losers in this agreement. Perhaps in your overall calculation, people gain from it, but in a region like mine, people lose. Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for. We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change. The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO2
 emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO2
 emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad. We therefore clearly see once again that, when it comes to an industrial strategy, a strategy for our businesses and the choice of economy, it will be more the case that Europe suffers this agreement than that it shapes it. You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy, the green economy and innovation. I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged. Finally, your approach to discussing issues is often very balanced, but as soon as people start talking about taxes, all of a sudden … On the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the Tobin tax, I bet you, Mr De Gucht, that before the end of your mandate, the Commission will have to speak out strongly on the Tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, I have been very surprised at the self-satisfaction you show with regard to EU action in the climate field. It is true that Europe has done more and better work in the last 10 years than most of the other countries in the world, but there was clearly a failure of European leadership in Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, we also saw Europe become simply the combination of the personal communication strategies of the European Heads of State or Government, and I should like to specifically mention Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Brown in this connection. Under these circumstances, it is clearly easy to knock the UN process. It is true that the UN system is complicated, and that a G20, where the agreements are meaningless but there are opportunities for major publicity stunts, is much simpler. This means that this coming year, Europe must do more and better work. We currently have a 20% target. However, 20% actually means doing less in the next 10 years than we have done in the past 10 years; it means reducing Europe’s climate effort. This is not only absurd for the climate, when the scientists are telling us that we have to reach a 40% target, but it is also absurd for our economy and jobs. Therefore, Mrs Espinosa, please do not reduce Europe’s climate ambition to the lowest common denominator, to the objectives voiced by President Barroso, who does not want to budge from the 20% figure, or to those voiced by Italy and Poland, which will soon deny the existence of climate change. Reread Parliament’s resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30%. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as we know – according to a number of scientific studies and also Yvo de Boer – emerging countries are today making at least as much effort as Europe with a view to 2020. We also know that, in the negotiations, there is already a right of scrutiny regarding emerging economies, and that this is exercised more and more through the emissions inventory, through the report on the measures taken. The World Resources Institute has published statistics showing that China stands at around 70 tonnes per capita, a cumulative figure since 1950, whereas the United States stands at 810 tonnes and the EU-27 stands at 413 tonnes. We therefore kindly ask you to have the good sense, first and foremost, to use the European Parliament resolution as a negotiating mandate. This would be the best thing we could do for the sake of both the climate and our emergence from the crisis in Europe. Next, I call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to have the intelligence and the credibility to withdraw its amendment that says that emerging countries must do the same thing, must make the same commitments as rich countries. That is not acceptable, that is not serious. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, after 15 years of negotiating the trade aspect of the Barcelona Process, we have very serious doubts about whether the negotiation of a Euromed-type free trade agreement is the right solution to the social, political and economic problems in the region. The impact assessment, as has been said, above all revealed that there were some potentially very serious negative impacts, whether social, environmental or in terms of regional integration. In this context, Mr President, Commissioner, we believe that the proposal being made by the Commission – the road map for 2010 and beyond – is too one-sided, with its bilateral free trade agreement aspect, to be along the right lines. We support the draft resolution that is being debated today, not least because it asks all these questions relating to social impacts, environmental impacts and impacts on regional integration, and above all because, in paragraph 10, it calls for the aims of the trade agreements to be revisited, particularly in view of these social and environmental issues, and then above all because, by revisiting these agreements, we could perhaps think about reintegrating the trade aspect into the overall Barcelona Process. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths, and inaction, for us, is a crime against humanity. We know that this is an emergency, we know that there is no plan B, and yet, today, the negotiations are at a standstill. It is easy to say that it is the United States’ fault, but we believe that Europe is also hugely responsible. Europe is unfortunately no longer, as the Prime Minister claims, the leader in the climate-change negotiations. Extending Europe’s current commitments to the entire planet means having 4 degrees of global warming by the end of the century, 4 degrees of global warming! That is unacceptable, and it will no longer be enough, as President Barroso is also claiming, to hide behind the legislative character of this commitment alone. Independent studies show today that Japan, Norway and Switzerland are ready to make greater efforts than Europe. With regard to the emerging countries – China, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia – they too are making commitments domestically that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them. If there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel’s speech, it is how to be modest and how to be realistic. Let us stop pretending that everything stands still outside Europe, that the world has not changed since Kyoto, and that Europe is always far ahead of the international community. In refusing to take account of the requests of the European Parliament and, in particular, of its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has assumed responsibility for something very serious: failure at the Copenhagen Summit. It is not too late; Europe can resume its leadership by immediately increasing its reduction target to 30% and by granting at least EUR 30 billion in aid to the countries of the South. In so doing, we will lead the countries of the South and force an agreement out of the Americans. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths and will cause millions more in the future. Inaction is a crime against humanity. This is an emergency, but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill. However, countries such as Japan, Australia, Norway, China, Brazil and South Africa are making efforts that are commensurate with their responsibilities. This is not the case with the United States, and it is unfortunately no longer the case with Europe. Extending Europe’s ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees. That is totally unacceptable. However, it is Europe that holds the key to Copenhagen. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if the European summit, acting on the European Parliament’s recommendations, takes the right decisions at the end of the month, then Europe can boost the negotiations – with targets of a 30% reduction and a EUR 35 billion aid package for the countries of the South. Mr President, the way in which certain Member States today use aid for the countries of the South as a negotiating tool is, in our view, absolutely shocking. The distress of the countries of the South is not a matter for negotiation. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I am an elected representative from a region in the west of France, where there is a very high concentration of dairy farmers, and I do not believe that you have acknowledged the tragic social situation they are experiencing today. Commissioner, when you speak of ‘producers’, what I hear is ‘manufacturers’ and ‘distributors’. Dairy producers do not need your compassion, Commissioner. They do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis. Dairy producers need a genuine agricultural policy. They need strict quotas. That is why we are calling on the Council to overturn your policy and instead to create a genuine policy to support dairy producers and to put an end to this policy of destroying them en masse.Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, during those nine months of work, with the confidence and valuable support of all key players, including – and I say this most emphatically – MEPs, who never gave up the fight for truth and justice, we were able to gain an awareness of the extent of the elements incriminating Europe and the Member States in the implementation of the CIA’s secret programme. All these key players are categorical and all the elements, that is to say, the research carried out by the Council of Europe, the special UN rapporteurs, the Red Cross, national and international human rights organisations, investigative journalists, the testimony of the victims, of their lawyers and of CIA agents, concur: the Member States have to answer for their active or passive complicity in crimes of torture, secret detention and enforced disappearance. For nine months, I was able to see the patently obvious limitations of the investigative steps taken by the Member States and their stubborn determination to conceal the truth: lack of political will, prevalence of national interests, narrow remits for investigations, abuse of state secrecy, lack of transparency, restriction of the rights of victims and of their lawyers. The imagination of national authorities knows no bounds. In putting this report to the vote, Parliament aims to take a decisive step towards putting an end to the denial of reality, and hence of justice, which has characterised the strategy of the EU Member States for 11 years now. Through its recommendations to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, the report expresses a simple and clear will: every effort must be made to ensure that rigorous, independent and transparent investigations, capable of determining responsibilities and obtaining justice for the victims, are concluded. The European Union and the Member States owe it, first and foremost, to the victims, but they also owe it to Europe’s citizens, who are entitled to demand from our institutions, from their institutions, respect for democratic values and the rule of law on which they are based. To be effective, we had to be concrete and specific and to stay abreast of the issue so that we could identify the best levers to help justice move forward. We therefore chose to focus on the issue of secret prisons on EU territory. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of Eurocontrol, which I thank, and to the visits and meetings of the Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) (rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs), today there are grounds for the report to adopt recommendations of relevance to Poland, Lithuania and Romania in particular. These three countries are now before the European Court of Human Rights facing allegations of torture, secret detention and failure to investigate effectively. Your rapporteur is convinced, more than ever, that only a coordinated European approach aimed at supporting Member States can break the code of silence. The challenge for the Council is to take the matter in hand officially and to put it on its work agenda, to acknowledge its responsibility and, finally, to apologise. The Commission, while having taken note of the facts, has still not mobilised all its justice and human rights resources and instruments to ensure that Member States comply with their fundamental obligations. It must take initiatives to uphold the principle of mutual assistance and solidarity. Commissioner Reding, the report invites us, you, the Council, the victims and all those who seek the truth to return to this House in a year’s time. Last week, Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen resident in Germany who had been detained without trial for five years at Guantánamo, again came to Parliament to speak about his ordeal, still very current, and to seek justice for the victims. Commissioner Reding, if Mr Kurnaz has the strength to come back in a year’s time, will we be able to tell him that facts have been established, that responsibilities have been acknowledged, and that we can, finally, apologise to him on behalf of the European Union? (Applause) Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate to support this work, which has been long and arduous and which, as I said in my introduction, will bring us together again in a year’s time. I think that a lot can be done in the Member States in a year. We are not, of course, prosecutors and we do not have to ‘provide definite proof’. We simply know – if I take the example of Romania – that an investigation has been carried out in the Senate. You have pointed it out; it has been mentioned. I am also aware that there have been numerous allegations. I know that Eurocontrol has found evidence of new flights connecting Romania to Lithuania. A case file, which is mentioned in the complaint against Romania lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, was drawn up by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Hammarberg, and submitted to the authorities. None of these elements forms part of the public findings of the investigation. I think that it is not about singling out individual countries for general opprobrium because colleagues have placed great emphasis – and it is, I hope, a strong aspect of this report – on our collective responsibility. What is, in fact, happening? The reality is that each country holds a fragment of the truth. As a result, each country must carry out its investigations to the best of its ability so as to be able to expose this system because it is, in fact, a system. We have no intention of stigmatising this or that country. It is clear and evident – no one can deny it – that, in Romania, a new investigation, a judicial investigation, must be conducted, because the elements –which do not constitute proof; we are not prosecutors – are nevertheless important enough to warrant the reopening of an investigation. The report calls for nothing more, nothing less. The report asks Romania to conduct an investigation, and calls on the Commission, in fact, to show that each country holds a fragment of the truth and that the Commission, in particular, has the means, the power, the duty and the obligation to ensure that this fragment of truth enlightens other countries so that all EU citizens can be informed. You can do a lot. The rule is noted: you are strict, and I congratulate you on your resoluteness and on your regular interventions on fundamental rights violations within the framework of the implementation of EU law. However, in flagrant cases of unexplained massive violations, the means must be found to be accountable for the violations committed. For example, as regards the issue of interest to us here, you can bring in prosecutors, you can pool, or help to pool, information. You can translate all useful documents. You can gather together information and make it available to the Member States to help them conduct these investigations. The letters you are going to send once again to each Member State – which I welcome – must contain all the new elements that have come to light, including the analyses carried out by Reprieve
 of the data provided by Eurocontrol. That is what we are expecting, that is to say, a lot of work in the next year for a meeting which, I very much hope, will be a resounding success. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, last Thursday, a vessel from Turkey ran aground: 61 people, including 31 children, drowned. Most of them were Syrian refugees. The following night, a vessel sank close to Lampedusa, resulting in the deaths of several dozen people from Tunisia. Each new shipwreck adds to the macabre head count of the thousands of deaths already recorded in the Mediterranean. One has to question the responsibilities of the European Union and its obligations concerning rescue at sea. These people are fleeing war and poverty, but they are also faced with ever more perilous routes due to the obsession with security that characterises our migration policy. I call on the Commission to propose guidelines, as the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union required it to do, concerning rescue at sea. I also call on the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), which has developed a new human rights strategy, to implement it effectively in order to ensure the security of migrants. This is a humanitarian emergency. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, Ms Schaake has raised a very relevant issue with the Presidency of the Council. I am sure its representative will endeavour to provide a response to it. The situation on the ground, as described, has peaked, reaching new levels of apocalyptic violence and horror – with 800 deaths last week. The Human Rights Watch report, systematic torture in one of the 27 detention centres and the witness reports given are quite unbearable. At the same time, for just over a week now, I think, we have seen fresh diplomatic initiatives which are maybe precursors of the wind of change needed to find a solution. I think, even so, that the meeting held in Geneva made a start – albeit limited and not totally satisfactorily – towards the proposal for a transitional government of national unity, obviously without Assad and his torturers, but including some among its numbers. This has two benefits. In this situation, just because we feel that a solution is possible does not necessarily mean there will be less violence on the ground. Quite the contrary. We could see an escalation of violence by the regime. From this point of view, this proposal both encourages the mass desertions seen among soldiers of the regular army but must also enable acceptance of members of the Assad regime and the Baath Party as part of this interim solution. As things stand, I believe that this is extremely important. I hope that this prospect, which was encouraged by the meeting of all the components of the Syrian opposition, by the Arab League this week, by the meetings of the Russian Foreign Minister with the Syrian opposition, marks a turning point in this situation which offers a glimmer of hope. Moreover, I think that the EU should fully exploit this glimmer of hope, especially at the meeting of the Friends of the Syrian people in Paris at the end of the week. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, your words are hardly of any reassurance to me regarding the European Union’s capacity to take action. To be honest, it is calling on the opposition to unite for the umpteenth time, listing the risks that the situation presents for the umpteenth time, risks that have already been proven and are still very much present: regionalisation, militarisation, communitarisation, etc. These risks are also the result of the international community’s inability to have provided its support in good time to a people’s uprising against a dictator. I also believe that the situation is now so complicated and so difficult that there is no correct solution any more. However, inaction will cost us even more dearly. In other words, in three months’ time, we will be having the same old debate and you will be telling us how militarisation, communitarisation and regionalisation have been exacerbated further. Yes, we need to act then but there is no correct solution. Faced with the need and duty to protect the people, we are practically faced with the dilemma of having to choose whether we should violate international law by bypassing the Security Council. Yet we have to put all the options on the table. I heard Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra talking about a force being present on the ground. I also heard what Ms Brantner had to say. These options need to be looked at. This is absolutely urgent. We then need to put pressure on Russia because Russia, I can assure you, is in a very comfortable position. Today in France, the largest arms-producing company is currently showing at the international exhibition of weapons, in Villepinte, with total impunity. I have not heard anyone in Europe or in France, or you yourselves, dispute this fact. I therefore think that Russia does not feel under any threat whatsoever. We all know it is about the carrot and the stick with Russia. What have you dangled in front of them in your discussions? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, finally, since the start of this debate there have not been many fellow Members who believe that this agreement does not, in one way or another, undermine the fundamental rights of European citizens. To put it simply, some people are saying ‘It’s better than nothing. It would be worse if there was no agreement. In the end, it’s worth chipping away a little at our rights if we can see a corresponding benefit in terms of security.’ That is what we have been saying recently. Yet we know perfectly well – we have not only been saying it, but we have also demonstrated it – that a policy of combating terrorism, in order to be effective, rather than just being moral or meeting international obligations, must respect the totality of human rights, international law and our obligations. It is extremely hard to believe that this agreement could not be demolished by a court, if ever we in this Chamber were not able to shoulder our political responsibilities, because that is what this is actually about. Will we manage to stand beside the citizens of Europe – past evidence shows that they can only rely on the European Parliament in these areas – or will we allow ourselves to be overawed by threats? We have seen what happened in the past. With regard to the system implemented by the CIA, when there were secret prisons, illegal transfers and torture on our territory, who stood beside us in the Council and in the Commission to set up inquiries and find out who is responsible? No one. We want to cooperate. We have no mechanism of accountability when the services operate outside the legal framework. This is a serious matter.

Mr President, I said that, during our debate here in Parliament, no one denied the fact that we were in the process of seriously eroding the rights of citizens. You say that the citizens are not properly informed. However, you have undermined your case, Mrs Foster. It is a serious problem if we take citizens’ personal details when they themselves are even less able to monitor them because they are not even informed. To be frank, I think it is not sensible to go down a road – and we are going to say this to the European citizens – which would lead to them becoming involved in an American-style system for fighting terrorism, with military tribunals in the absence of procedural safeguards, endless cases of imprisonment and detention without charge. I truly believe that European citizens deserve to be informed of the fate that you want for them, Mrs Foster. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, this is not the first time this issue has been raised. I believe that all the bodies – the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, civil society organisations – have, at some time or other, sounded the alarm. What is more, this alarm has been heard by the Commission. Greece has since launched a national asylum and immigration plan. Today, however, there is no escaping the fact that the situation in the detention centres – and I have visited some in Greece – remains an insult to human dignity, that, since the start of the year, dozens of people have been killed at the Greek-Turkish border trying to cross the River Evros, and that NGOs are now seeing, within the context of the economic and social crisis in Greece, a sudden increase in racist attacks; they have recorded 63 cases in Athens and Patras, 18 of which involved police officers, during the last six months of 2011. It is clear that, in the period leading up to the elections in Greece, we hear preposterous proposals and a surfeit of extremely xenophobic policies – which can only be described as anti-immigrant – like the proposal to build detention centres, but, in particular, the proposal to herd together migrants and asylum seekers suspected of being ill. We also hear political leaders characterise the issue of migrants as a time bomb for society and for the security of the country. Confronted with this, of course, the European Union must respond with its values, its instruments and its principle of cooperation and solidarity. In this regard, it should nonetheless be said to the Member States that threatening Greece with expulsion from the Schengen area is an absolutely scandalous proposal, when, at the same time, the Member States openly regret that the Court prevents them from sending the asylum seekers back to Greece under the Dublin Regulation. Frankly, this cowardice and this hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the European Union cannot be tolerated, and the Commission has a great responsibility in this regard to guarantee our fundamental principles. As far as Turkey is concerned, I believe we should try to look at the situation as it is. With regard to the Community readmission agreement, Turkey is calling for equal treatment. Yet this is absolutely a case of double standards, since there is no prospect of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas with Turkey … (The President urged the speaker to bring her speech to a close)
 and that, at this very moment, Turkey is welcoming thousands of refugees at the Syrian border. I therefore believe that we should stop passing the buck from one country to another and assume this fundamental responsibility jointly. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am very pleased with this report and I would like to take the opportunity to thank its rapporteur, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, who has carried out an extremely comprehensive job. I think that this report, as a whole, calls for and supports the democratic reforms and the protection of fundamental freedoms in Turkey. I believe that the messages that it sends are extremely clear and precise and that they are of course addressed to the authorities, but also to all the actors in the political arena and civil society to encourage them to become more involved in further strengthening the democratic State in Turkey. The report does not fail to make clear our grave concerns regarding the way in which the law against terrorism has been applied, directly threatening freedom of expression and opinion, the right to hold demonstrations, the freedom of the press and we are asking for this law to be amended, particularly Articles 6 and 7. We also support and call for a thoroughgoing reform of the judicial system: citizens, all citizens in Turkey, must be able to trust an efficient, impartial and independent judicial system and we support any reform that works towards this end. We have also looked at the Kurdish question and we are clearly of the view that education in one’s native language is a perfectly satisfactory proposal to provide a response to the Kurdish question that is political and not merely for reasons of security. I think that these strong messages are all more credible when we do not hold back on our demands in the Council, particularly to ensure true consistency and to enable the European Union to finally recover its ability to pioneer reforms in Turkey and to use leverage to promote them. We are asking for all these measures to be taken with a view to opening chapters 23 and 24. Our demands are also clear in the case of visas: we need a roadmap for the liberalisation of visas, as this situation in a country in the process of accession to the European Union is quite unique, and therefore totally discriminatory. We want these essential messages to be heard in Turkey and I would not wish for the readership of this excellent report and its importance in relation to the current situation in Turkey to be diminished or detracted from by questionable statements. What is the purpose of the reference in this text to the secular integrity of the armed forces? We are delighted with the huge amount of work which has been achieved in Turkey over a number of years to ensure that the armed forces recover their place, under the control of the civil authorities, and for military expenditure to be brought under the oversight of the Court of Accounts. What is the purpose of this reference to the secular integrity of armed forces which have served NATO since 1952, which are one of its largest armed forces and the presence of which is being made conditional on this secular integrity? We know the nature of the armed forces of a secular, non-religious State. That is what we want for Turkey and I think that together we must delete those words. As for the Ergenekon trial, lastly, it is not credible to cast doubt on all cases in the Ergenekon trial as we know, and the European Court of Human Rights reiterated this in December in a judgment, there are perfectly well-founded cases where arrests on the basis of accusations of crimes or criminal acts have been judged to be well founded by the European Court of Human Rights. We cannot let ourselves be suspicious of and rule out all the cases involved in the Ergenekon trial. My opinion is this: if we remove these two references, we will have the widest possible readership, which is extremely important, in Turkey, in society as a whole, and in its entire political and social fields. (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, I actually think that we are no longer talking here of repression or of an oppressed people, but of an intolerable terror, perpetrated by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. We only need to see how public hospitals have now been transformed into centres of torture, execution and kidnapping. Given that, I will not list the considerable number of people injured, the number of people who have disappeared, the number of detainees or the number of deaths. The UN Human Rights Council got it right when it said that we are dealing here with crimes against humanity. Ms De Keyser is right: Assad will have to account for his crimes before the International Criminal Court. In the face of this terror, I sincerely wish to salute the courage, determination and the incredible capacity for resistance shown by organised civil society in Syria as, despite everything, the food arrives, despite everything, information is exchanged, despite everything, protection is provided for those who demonstrate. Despite everything, medical care is provided in living rooms that have been transformed into emergency hospitals. I believe that the channels that are in place are precarious and dangerous. We should discuss and work to see how we might now intensify the movement of goods, care, food and protection via these informal channels, how we can make it secure, stronger and broader, how we can protect those who are risking their lives to move these goods. This, I feel, is the first way to give practical help, which is what we are calling for. Obviously, sanctions must be strengthened and it is necessary, above all, to ensure that they are implemented appropriately. I really do believe that the European Commission and the Council have to ask themselves how a boat laden with arms was able to sail to Syria from a Cypriot port to supply Bashar al-Assad with weapons that he is using against his own people. There is the Arab League initiative. Of course, it has to be supported, but vigilance is required too. We are well aware that the Arab League represents a set of extremely diverse interests. We are well aware that the initiatives there are proliferating before the Presidency of the Arab League is taken over by Iraq. All this is well known but, given the situation, the European Union must very clearly define its strategy and be able to deliver it on the 24th in Tunis. It is right that this meeting should take place in Tunis, because it is important. It shows that this story is, first and foremost, the story of a people at the mercy of its oppressor. We are looking at Syria as a piece on a complicated chessboard and, if we move that piece, we are wondering what the next moves might be. We have to come back to the base of the conflict, of this battle, to support the population. The story unfolding today in Syria is truly that of a society that is struggling for democracy and for rights. Without being naïve, we should see that as the main goal, towards which we should turn all of our efforts. As a result, the meeting on 24 February must allow us to isolate or bring on board those countries that currently support the Syrian regime. Of course, there is China and Russia, but there is also Algeria. We must apply maximum pressure to isolate Assad. That is one way to give practical help. We must also recognise the National Council. It has its faults, but we must maintain a political dialogue with it to help it to become the political interlocutor for the future Syria. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I would like to stress the last point raised by Ms Schaake, because, indeed, not only is it a disgrace, it is also utterly ludicrous, that the European Union and its Council have not come up with the political means to invite Turkey to the table to discuss the situation in Syria. It is now clear that the future scenario called for by Ms De Keyser can only come about through dialogue between Turkey, in particular, the Arab League and the European Union. It is true that there is no written script, but, nevertheless, we do have some assurances. Firstly, Bashar al-Assad will fall. He will fall. That is the deeply-held belief that we all share and, at best, he will be handed over to the International Criminal Court. He will therefore fall. What this tells us is that civil society has an incredible capacity, not only to mobilise itself, but also to coordinate and organise itself, and to do so neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city, through a totally effective and impressive horizontal network. Just look at what they achieved with the first of six stages of the general strike in Syria, when they called on everyone not to go to the mosque, not to go shopping, to close shops early, to stay at home, not to make telephone calls, to carry out some form of civil disobedience. ‘Dead Syria’, just like the ‘dead city’ that is often referred to. We can see how impressive the organisation behind this is. What we have here is a population adopting the approach of civil disobedience and non-violent action. I do not really want to repeat what you have said regarding the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and which was picked up by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, but I do not get the feeling at all that we are now on the brink of civil war. What is certain is that growing numbers of soldiers, including those in the Free Syrian Army, are assuming the role of protectors of the people in coordination with local committees. It is absolutely essential that we offer our assistance in this very specific battle on the ground, which is being conducted in a non-violent manner with the Free Syrian Army offering defence and protection. This is where we must be effective, offering very simple but practical things: help with radios, communications, intelligence capabilities for the opposition, capabilities in the field of new technologies once sold to al-Assad, but which we must now supply to the opposition. These are the concrete steps that we can take to strengthen their operational capability and I think ... (The President cut off the speaker) Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), we focused instead on communications regarding the new partnership for mobility, for two reasons: because of the aspirations expressed, aspirations to rights, including, it would appear, the right to mobility, and also because, to date, our migration policy with these countries clearly rested in the iron fists of dictators who, I am glad to say, are no longer in place. We therefore take a very positive view of the partnership for mobility but would like to question the link still established between the readmission agreements, legal migration and the fight against illegal immigration, relying solely on the report prepared by the Commission itself on readmission agreements. The report says that implementation is inconsistent and not transparent, that the negotiating mandate is unrealistic, that there are serious risks of human right violations and that even this assessment acknowledges that visa liberalisation has no impact on illegal immigration. I therefore think that a little further reflection is needed and then, above all, we need to develop an approach with these countries that is fully rooted in the mutual benefits of mobility, establishing a structured dialogue. And when we talk about partnership with civil society, this means both mobility and other issues, it is critical that this partnership with civil society, which is the key to success, includes a concrete mechanism for consulting civil society at all stages, early on during the implementation and evaluation.

 Mr President, neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission, nor even the Council, I was going to say, have stood helplessly by in the face of the extremely serious discrimination suffered by the Roma. Parliament is well known for its resolutions on this subject. The European Commission set up a Roma Task Force and issued a Communication on the issue in April 2011, and the Council adopted a European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies for each Member State at the end of June. Nevertheless, I feel that this text certainly has inherent weaknesses, attention to which was drawn at the time. This weakness concerned the goals that were set concerning the fight against anti-Gypsyism and discrimination. Consequently, now, with just one month to go before Member States must submit their strategies to the European Commission, we have grave doubts about the efforts governments have made to include stakeholders, local and regional authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Roma populations themselves in drawing up their national strategies. Above all, however, I have the feeling that day after day, an extremely worrying situation is emerging from the press, from eye-witness accounts, from facts related by NGOs and from reports. They speak of violence and hateful anti-Roma demonstrations, attempts on their freedom of movement, segregation at school, forced expulsions, human trafficking, forced sterilisation of women, and of the way that anti-Roma rhetoric has become commonplace in political circles. Faced with this, I believe that our positive, inclusive agenda must categorically go hand in hand with the utmost vigilance and be rigorously enforced. I believe that the European Commission must use all the means at its disposal to be extremely strict towards Member States in its role as guardian of the acquis communautaire
 and of the Treaties. Let me quote you an example. The massive expulsions that took place in France have just been unambiguously condemned by the Council of Europe as ‘an aggravated violation of human rights’. In its defence, the French Government cited the decision of the European Commission, which, as the French Government saw it, found the evictions to be completely compatible with European law. I believe that Member States should no longer be able to resort to this type of argument and that the Commission must be extremely strict. As for us, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we too must do more. In addition to our extremely important work, we should set up a monitoring group to include members of national parliaments, in association with NGOs, so that we can in any case fight much more effectively against the discrimination suffered by the Roma.

The Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from voting on the 2012 budget at first reading on 26 October 2011. We deeply regret the creation of an envelope of EUR 200 000 ‘to fund pilot projects or other support activities aiming to analyse the public acceptance of the exploration for and exploitation of shale gas and introducing a dialogue on this matter’. We cannot accept that a single European cent be used to fund propaganda in favour of shale gas. Furthermore, this first post-Fukushima budget still grants a substantial allocation to the ITER nuclear reactor, which is an extravagant and pointless project, and a dead end in terms of energy and ecology. For these two reasons at least, we were not able to vote in favour of this draft budget, despite the fact that green pilot projects, an increase in financial assistance for Palestine and substantial savings in administrative costs have been adopted. We have therefore decided to abstain, particularly so as not to weaken Parliament’s position in the difficult negotiations now due to begin with the Council. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am not sorry that we are having this debate, because at the end of the day, there has not been any discussion of Turkish-Cypriot relations nor of the situation in Cyprus since 2004. So this is the first time since then that we have had an open discussion about a European Union Member State in which there has been a United Nations international peace-keeping mission since 1964 in relation to a conflict with a country engaged in the accession process. Stating the facts naturally highlights the fairly ludicrous nature of the situation. As far as I am concerned, this debate is not about whether Cyprus is exercising its sovereign right by deciding to drill in its exclusive economic zone. That is beyond doubt. International law clearly says that Cyprus is in the right, but equally we could envisage a situation whereby, under a future agreement, the benefits from that drilling would be shared fairly between the two communities. Having said that, I feel that the timing of the operation is reprehensible because, at the end of the day, this decision is prejudicial to the negotiations due to begin in the coming days under the aegis of the United Nations. In my view, the role of our Parliament – as has already been demonstrated – is not to engage in one-upmanship but rather to make a constructive contribution to achieving overall peace within the framework of an agreement for a federal country made up of two zones and two communities. What is more, the substance of a future agreement is known and almost – I nearly said for the most part – on the table. The question that we need to ask ourselves as Europeans is what Member States and the European Union are doing to bring a political agreement into the world and to encourage all the stakeholders to take constructive confidence building measures. However, sometimes I feel that the question of Cyprus is intentionally left to one side, to be used when the need arises in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey. I would like practical measures to be taken today by the Union and the Member States to support and encourage a rapid resolution to what is essentially a European problem. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, the Frontex Agency is an agency that has been untouched by the crisis, given that its budget has increased from just over EUR 6 million in 2005 to more than EUR 80 million today. In other words, Frontex has grown without facing any awkward questions for many years. Ultimately, the Member States saw something to be gained from this: firstly, the availability of resources for their own internal operations; secondly, the opportunity to turn to Frontex when faced with countries that were seen to be failing to control their borders; and thirdly, the increase in Frontex’s powers and resources, which everyone was calling for. This also enabled the Director of Frontex, only two years ago, to tell MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who were worried about human rights being violated, that it was not Frontex’s job to deal with that issue; it was the responsibility of the Member States! Frontex has ultimately grown against this backdrop of irresponsibility with regard to human rights. I think that, today, it is really to the credit of Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, that the issue of fundamental rights protection was placed so high on the agenda of the negotiations. I say this, of course, because the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force and Frontex is now accountable for its actions to the Court of Justice, which is no small thing; and also because a number of reports show that the principle of non-refoulement has been violated several times during Frontex operations and that access to asylum application procedures, which is an inviolable and international right, has been somewhat mismanaged. We are also awaiting a report from Human Rights Watch, which will show that Frontex is responsible, to some extent, for the unfair detention of migrants. We therefore had a real problem with regard to respect for human rights, and I believe that the negotiations have enabled us to make serious progress in this area. Nevertheless, this does not mean that my group will be voting in favour of this mandate, because we believe that independence – as mentioned by Ms Lochbihler in particular – independent observation, and reliable, impartial and independent procedures for combating human rights violations, have not been established. This is what will ultimately lead my group to abstain. Moreover, I should like to take advantage of this debate in order to question the Commission and the Council on the results and the status of Operation Hermes, the most recent Frontex operation: boats, helicopters, 2 000 drowned in the Mediterranean since the NATO intervention in Libya. What did Frontex do during this time? I do not know. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, all these populations are putting a colossal amount of energy into overthrowing regimes that are enemies of freedom and are oppressing them. We cannot help but admire this energy, and it puts paid to the prejudices held in various quarters about the supposed backwardness of the Arab world. As has already been said, it requires a good deal of the European Union to rise to the challenge of these aspirations. For us to condemn the violence, support those who promote change, impose sanctions on the dictators, start again from scratch the deals we had negotiated with fallen powers, take on board the human, political and economic consequences of the upheaval that is going on, prevent counter-revolutionary attempts, mitigate the causes of destabilisation and rebuild our relationship as one of partnership, is a revolution in itself for the European Union. Who now seriously believes that Bashar al-Assad is capable of beginning a political process that would involve those who promote democracy and change, and would establish the rule of law? I certainly do not, and I do not think many people do. And yet, there is no appeal to President al-Assad to leave power in our resolution. Nor is there a majority, unless we see proof to the contrary, willing to call the atrocities committed by this regime against peaceful citizens crimes against humanity, which is what they are, and to bring a case before the International Criminal Court through a Security Council resolution. I do not think we have exhausted all the possibilities for diplomacy. Turkey could provide valuable help on this, if it can persuade the hesitant countries that have been mentioned, especially Russia and Brazil, but also China. Taking responsibility also means protecting. It means resettling refugees, activating temporary protection, rescuing people at sea. These are the concrete steps that the European Union should be proposing for refugees, instead of organising top-level crisis meetings to discuss EU law. If the EU wants to be consistent, it needs a system that will allow civil society to be involved at every stage in defining objectives and indicators and in implementing and evaluating the EU’s agreements with its future partners. This will represent real change for the European Union. Our partners are now accountable to their people, and their people are eagerly expressing their democratic demands. Baroness Ashton, you were correct in your intuition and your analysis, well before the revolutions began. At the beginning of your mandate, you said that the validity of the EU’s external policy would be tested in its own neighbourhood. How true that is! If the Union rises to the challenge of these peoples’ democratic aspirations, its role on the new world scene will no longer hang as a question mark over the suffering that is piling up. In the situation as it stands today, it is the status of the European Union in this 21st century world taking shape before our eyes that is at stake. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, it is very good news that populations are moving to reclaim their freedoms and rights, and to obtain a change of the political regime and more democracy. This is at the heart of the European Union’s foreign policy and of the European project. That can only evoke our enthusiasm and our support. The very bad news, however, is that these populations are suffering an extremely tough repression, demonstrating these values and aspirations while putting their lives at risk, and that is totally unacceptable. Thus, the imperative of protecting the populations, which has led to military action in Libya, must now take other forms to protect those who are demonstrating in these three countries. I think that the statements are extremely important – the legitimate statements, the aspirations held by these populations – but we also need action. As part of this action, we need an assurance that all those leaders responsible for using disproportionate force against their populations will not go unpunished. In order to do that, the diplomatic convocation and activation of the Member States of the United Nations Human Rights Council must be in full swing in order to get missions, reports and resolutions so that the politicians responsible get an assurance that these acts of violence will not remain unpunished. Finally, I think that we certainly do have methods for bypassing the ‘blackout’ of the press. Journalists, whether national or foreign, are facing considerable difficulties in documenting the situation. We know what to do; we have instruments for bypassing these obstacles. We absolutely must make use of them. Then, when we have the means to act, I think that we must find a way of using them. Clearly, this is not the time to chase the Syrian President to get his signature on a readmission agreement, which could, in any case, only be envisaged under certain conditions, including a very serious, effective and relevant programme, the implementation of reforms in Syria and the freeing of all prisoners of conscience and peaceful demonstrators, not just here, but also in the other two countries.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the popular movements in the Southern Mediterranean have clearly highlighted weaknesses in our European Neighbourhood Policy. As I see it, the problem lies not so much with the Neighbourhood Policy objectives, which are set out in Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty of Lisbon on promoting and respecting human rights and democracy – which are also social objectives – but rather in our flawed implementation of those objectives. Consequently, we need to learn lessons for the future. This is what is being done in the current work on reviewing the policy. The first issue, which was raised by Mr Schulz, is our ability to provide real and effective support for civil society in all neighbouring countries, irrespective of their importance in terms of trade or strategy, or their political situation. When neighbouring countries are in a state of transition, this is extremely useful and necessary. It is also undeniably easier than when they are labouring under the yoke of an authoritarian regime, as is the case in Syria, but this is a challenge, an issue, that we need to learn to address effectively. I believe that we will also need to learn to discuss these matters with our partners, not only in forums dedicated to human rights, such as sub-committees, but also at the highest political level. Yet, at the same time, we must ensure that sub-committee agendas do not become disconnected from the situation, as has happened in the past, or fail to feed into other bodies, such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA). I support the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which I believe is pivotal. It seems to me that we should also add a separate target for social justice and combating inequalities. Naturally, we will also need to rethink our understanding of mobility in the Mediterranean region. I think that the mobility partnership is a positive feature, but we will also need to learn how to promote the benefits of this mobility for individuals who travel between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and for both the host nation and the country of origin. We will also need to factor these changing movements into basic rights for those who cross the Mediterranean and settle in Europe. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, it is of course good news that we now have a concrete European framework that is going to place an obligation on every Member State to present its national Roma integration strategy. Between now and the end of the year, the Commission will assess these strategies and then in roughly one year’s time we will need to debate the issue again. Today, we are therefore in effect setting out a road map which should allow parliamentarians, public bodies and civil society to exercise ongoing, extreme vigilance in the very important areas you have mentioned. I note that the Commission communication takes on board some of the points we set out in the parliamentary report. I am talking for instance about the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency in the assessment of the strategies. I believe the Agency has proven its competence in this area. I am also talking about developing cooperation with the Council of Europe on training mediators from the Roma community. This is an important strategic factor for the success of the projects at all levels, as is the attention devoted to Roma who are nationals of third countries and the enlargement aspect, which is taken into consideration in this report. Lastly, I think that establishing common indicators to support the monitoring system is very much to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I must emphasise certain failings in this communication. I believe it is not sufficiently strong and insistent in its reference to the necessary participation of Roma at all levels, that is to say at the levels of preparing the projects, implementing the projects and evaluating them. The communication talks about information and consultation, but the involvement of the Roma community itself is vital. There is ample experience to prove this, because there have actually been good experiences in Europe as well. I find this a weakness in the communication. A second weakness in the communication is that it deals with the issue of non-discrimination as a cross-cutting theme in each of the four areas. However, I think it is very important, or would have been very important, to have a special paragraph devoted to combating discrimination and violence and to access to justice for the Roma. This anti-discrimination, fundamental rights, access to justice component is not included as a specific component in its own right. I find this another weakness in the Commission document. I think we also talked about the subject of mediators, a programme that was launched by the Council of Europe. It is good that it is mentioned in this communication. We could have mentioned, and you also could have mentioned the guidelines that have already been drawn up by the Council of Europe, so that we do not somehow end up with two strategies, or two types of framework for assessing the national strategies. I feel this would have been a plus in this communication. Finally, I think that the Commission’s work is not yet finished, and that the task force should continue its work, in order to ensure that Member States are constantly aware of the pressure on them from the Commission, civil society and local bodies to actually implement these guidelines.

 Mr President, the work that has been undertaken here on this report, under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume, is very important. As Mrs Malmström said, it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system, and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system. One ought, in fact, to call it an abyss, an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking. When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1-65%, when we have, in a State such as France for example, 75% of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal, when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect, we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission – and which is strengthened by the high quality report drafted under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume – namely, to improve the quality of decision making at first instance, is absolutely crucial. As I understand it, the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying, and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers. It should be remembered that Cyprus, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population. Let us listen to those States too, then, because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I do not think that we can welcome the revolution in Tunisia, on the one hand, and demand that the country implements the border control policy that existed in the days of the Ben Ali dictatorship, on the other. I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government, which has many other matters to attend to: its own refugees – as has been said – and overseeing its democratic transition process. The situation, then, is a new and exceptional one, and this should perhaps enable us to think up appropriate solutions while at the same time showing solidarity. Baroness Ludford is right – that is what is definitely lacking the most within the European Union. I think that the work of the European Commission, and of Parliament, could consist firstly in declaring a moratorium on the return of Tunisians, because that really is improper and inappropriate. We should also grant exceptional permission to reside to Tunisians who have already arrived in France and Italy, guarantee access to Europe to people seeking protection, and refrain from taking any steps or concluding any agreements that might get in the way of that protection, apply the provisions – as has been said – of the 2001 directive to all those eligible to take advantage of them, and accommodate refugees present at the border between Tunisia and Libya as part of the resettlement process. Next, I believe that we must think about forging cooperative links with these future fully democratic countries, so that Tunisians can come and work, study and travel perfectly legally, so as to create real channels of mobility between the two shores of the Mediterranean.

 Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work in providing rigorously detailed documentation and in drawing up a report in the utmost good faith with the aim of sending clear political messages, particularly on the eve of the legislative elections in Turkey, and I endorse this work. This report – unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable – stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution. However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors? There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations – in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 – and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner. Now, everyone can see that it is not. We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition. I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey’s accession. I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation. Today, this is very clearly in question. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, unfortunately, every day in the press, we read accounts of discriminative or racist acts against the Roma. Therefore, this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves, of course, and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union’s fundamental values. The Commission will therefore have to develop a framework, a European strategy, for the national action plans. Its responsibility will extend far beyond the development of this European framework for the national action plans, because the Member States will make progress on this subject only if they are given a strong incentive by the Commission to commit themselves to it. This will require – as the report explains very well – an extremely precise evaluation of the results obtained, with the use of benchmark criteria and indicators. It will also require the involvement of all interested parties and Roma communities in the first instance. I believe that it is very important to make the connection with the Council of Europe’s programme on the training of Roma mediators. This is an essential condition if the inclusion projects are to be crowned with success at regional level. Next, the European Commission also needs to get involved through its own projects, run by itself, pilot projects – that is what this report proposes – which could be run, for example, in the micro-regions that we have spoken about, so that exemplary, remarkable projects can convince all interested parties to become involved in this inclusion process. I believe, then, that the European Commission should also be able to use its right to officially complain when the values, European legislation and national action plans are not as they should be, bearing in mind equal access to all rights, non-discrimination and freedom of movement. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Gomes for giving us the chance to debate a mandate for negotiations that is certainly thorny, as is the content of the negotiations themselves. The Tunisian example should serve as a warning that we need to proceed very cautiously, especially in the way in which we report on the negotiations. We cannot simply notch up successes as we go through the negotiations and celebrate because a regime such as the Gaddafi regime may have agreed to certain human rights references, for example, because that regime is well-known for its major violations of all fundamental rights. What is more, all the migrants who arrive on our shores, though they are increasingly fewer in number, say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to Libya, because of the rapes, torture, abuse, forced repatriations, mass expulsions and racist acts. It has already been said, and I will repeat it: the list of serious, mass human rights abuses of migrants in Libya is long. So yes, of course, I think it is absolutely urgent that we do everything in our power to improve these people’s situation. This is a job for the High Commissioner for Refugees, and it is our task to resettle the individuals identified by the HCR. It is also a job for community-based organisations, which, at the moment, are extremely thin on the ground and need to be strengthened by all means possible. I believe that, if we truly want to abide by the goals we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties, we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants staying illegally in the EU back to Libya.

 Mr President, I think the aim of this discussion is to get the Council to finally show its hand, because I have to say that given such an ambitious, not to mention necessary, reform package on asylum, it is unbelievable that all we are getting are snippets of information, some contradictory, as to what is holding the Council up on these proposals that have been on the table for a long time now. We are getting a vague idea that the Council or the Member States may be stalling because of costs, but it is not even clear what is meant by this. Are they talking about human costs, political costs or financial costs? These different costs are sometimes linked in any case. One thing is for certain: there are instances of unsatisfactory practices and inadequate protection in Europe at the moment. In the first place, it is not true that Europe shoulders all the world’s problems. For example, in 2007, I think Europe took in only 14% of the world’s refugees. In the second place, some of the existing practices are utterly unacceptable. I am thinking of instances such as phallometric testing in the Czech Republic, right here in Europe, or the documents of the Committee against Torture, which brought to light many cases such as forced repatriation without the right to appeal or based on hurried-through procedures. I think we can certainly talk about costs: for example, we could talk about the cost of expelling migrants, which is very costly: the French Senate says that it costs EUR 20 000 per person expelled. Above all, we can talk about how we might improve the situation. There are certainly questions to be asked as to how we can improve the first-instance decision-making process, as Mrs Guillaume has done in her report, when roughly 50% of first-instance decisions are overturned on appeal. There are clearly very substantial economies to be made in terms of financial, human and political costs. We might take another look at the aberrations of the Dublin Convention, and I think the Council should look very carefully at these, because they also represent very substantial costs both in human and in financial terms. Lastly, and I will end here, one thing that is very expensive is detention, as the Parliamentary study confirms. The cost of detaining asylum seekers is prohibitive. This needs to be said, people need to be told and it needs to be discussed in the Council. This is absolutely urgent. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, this is a very good report, and the first one after the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, for her hard work, receptiveness and fruitful cooperation. I would like to come back to four messages contained in this report. The first concerns our requirement for the Commission to fulfil its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The situation of the Roma people has sadly been the first practical case, and the Commission has, in the end, only gone halfway on this matter, basing itself solely on the Free Movement Directive. The Commission has sidestepped the non-discrimination issue on the basis of Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it cannot be so half-hearted in future, with the ratification, by the Union, of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am delighted to see the Union’s commitment to seeing this through. The added value of this report also resides in the fact that it emphasises the need for early detection of potential violations through the implementation of a warning system. This system makes provision, among other things, for measures suspected of constituting such violations to be suspended while the accelerated procedure for determining whether they are contrary to fundamental rights is carried out. I would also insist on the need to set up a prevention system on the model, for example, of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism within the United Nations Council. Once again, I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes, as you have already mentioned, Mrs Reding. In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge. We are blindly endorsing these agreements when the actual terms of their implementation are being decided in joint committees from which Parliament is excluded. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).  
– (FR) 
Madam President, it has to be said that it is extremely odd to begin a directive which is intended to guarantee a legal framework for proper access to rights for all workers with a long list of the categories of workers excluded from that directive. That makes it seem like a project for legal migration but also for a multi-layered European labour market, where each category of workers would be assigned, according to their worth, a sort of portfolio of rights. We are therefore a long way from a horizontal and universal approach to workers’ rights. I think that those responsible in Europe have still not understood that more rights for workers means greater economic efficiency and greater social cohesion, with greater individual and collective benefits, of course, for migrants, for the host societies and for the societies of origin. Indeed, this has been shown in a study by the London School of Economics which says that regularising 600 000 irregular workers in Great Britain, who will not have access to this single application procedure, would bring GBP 3 billion into Great Britain’s coffers. We are not, I think, at all equal to the challenges. Hélène Flautre,

 Good evening Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Reding, you are quite rightly delighted today that France has responded to the European Commission's infringement proceedings at the eleventh hour and has provided a legislative programme for establishing procedural rights as required under the directive on the freedom of movement. According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice – as opposed to cancelled. We have taken note of your comments but as Members of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments. That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French authorities. However, let us not forget that you also asked France about individuals who have been escorted to the border and required to leave the country, an enquiry intended to confirm that these administrative procedures were not discriminatory. What has happened to those enquiries? Have you received a response? Just as the press revealed information about the villainous and discriminatory August circular, information was recently published about a file – a database – which contains personal information including details of ethnic or racial origin. Has this new twist not dented your confidence in the promises made by the French authorities and the accuracy of the information provided? Mrs Reding, would you not agree that the logical next step is now to tell us the current state of play in the ongoing examination of the documents requested by the Commission, both on the alleged discriminatory practices in France, but also regarding the potential infringement of data protection standards as laid down in Community law? I think that today’s European citizens are entitled to demand a responsible Commission which may publicise its successes but will also be determined in persevering with proceedings against the French authorities. After all, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which, it is widely recognised, have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma. I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data, in which the subjects are described as Gyppos, Gypsies or Roma.

 Madam President, I actually find our rapporteur very unwise in asking us MEPs to ratify and approve an agreement which really is highly problematic. First of all, it concerns Pakistan, which is not just any old country. Pakistan already admits more refugees than any other country in the world. And what are we mainly going to ask it to do? Readmit Pakistanis, of course, but also the Afghans who are here in Europe fleeing a war that we are waging in Afghanistan. I think we are starting to border on something like indecency here. It is a fact that Pakistan has not ratified the Geneva Convention, and it is a fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe asks us to ratify readmission agreements only with countries that offer a number of guarantees in terms of the right of asylum and international protection, which is not the case in Pakistan. Furthermore, there is a huge number of questions. If I had to say ‘Yes’ tomorrow, I do not even know what I am saying ‘Yes’ to. If you look closely at these various articles, the impact of this article may be anything from 20, may be anything from 100 to 20 000, and perhaps more. Why? Because nobody is saying what the responses will be to everything that is decided in the Readmission Committee. Who is responsible for proving that an individual arrived after the agreement had been ratified? Who will be responsible for proving that that individual arrived in the EU directly from Pakistan? What is going to happen at the end of the thirty day period if Pakistan does not respond and does not issue travel documents? Are we, as Members of the Commission suggest, going to accept this strange EU ‘pass’ instrument? I do not have any answers, and neither do you, Mrs Malmström; I know that you will be unable to provide me with any answers. I asked the Pakistani Ambassador, and he does not have any answers. All of that will be buried in the Readmission Committee. As we are incapable of saying what the actual impact of this agreement will be, I cannot say that I accept it. Everything depends on the answers provided to these questions. I think that we should say ‘No’ tomorrow. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, I must say that I fully share the consternation of Mr Swoboda and Mrs Weber. It is quite astounding that, after the various meetings you have been able to have and the documents you have received, you are still at this stage in acknowledging, or rather failing to acknowledge, the clear breaches that the French Government has committed in expelling the Roma. And this is not a new topic: a year ago, a group of voluntary organisations petitioned you on matters that are being raised again today, such as the failure to abide by the one month’s notice period before sending back European citizens that is enshrined in the Free Movement Directive. As regards the right to a personal examination of circumstances, I do not think you need any further expert opinions to conclude that when ‘escort to the border’ orders are handed out en masse
 in a camp, all identically addressed, this goes against the consideration of personal situations. Are six-year-old children a threat to public order? Do you really need additional proof, when justice and the French courts have judged this case and the French Government is using an extremely broad and illegitimate interpretation of a public order threat? If you need judges, experts or NGOs, we can provide you with them. However, please stop this denial of reality and this failure to fulfil your duties! The debate that took place this morning was a disgrace. We heard the leader of the European Parliament’s largest political group talking about the Roma people in connection with thefts of tractors in his local area. We heard José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, speaking during the debate on the Roma people about the security needs of European citizens. In other words, at the highest level of Europe’s political leaders, the tendency to automatically associate the Roma with crime, prostitution and trafficking is being boosted and fed. In doing so, they are placing fundamental rights and the whole point of Europe itself at stake. As Mr Cohn-Bendit said this morning: this is a test of you, Mrs Reding; this is a test of the Treaty of Lisbon, a test of your relevance. Will you be capable of proving, in this situation, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is anything other than a sham? It is down to you, it is your duty, and now is the time to proclaim this.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs in ’t Veld for her speech. At the very least, it clearly explains the reasons for her vote in favour, because from the start, in the speeches from the two large groups, I have not heard anything but smokescreens. The reality is that this agreement is not obviously any different, at least on the main points which motivated the opposition of the European Parliament in February. There are still cases of haphazard data transfer, and there is still the retention of data for five years. There is still effectively no right of recourse for European citizens on American territory, and there is the very important question raised by Mr Tavares concerning Europol. Europol is not a judicial institution, and it is not me who says that – it is the texts, the treaties. The European and national data protection supervisors are all in agreement on these essential points. As for me, I have the feeling that after having flexed our muscles – as you said, Mr De Clerck – we are now kowtowing, and this is not good news for European citizens. (Applause) Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the nine victims of the Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla, who were riddled with dozens of bullets, mostly at point-blank range and mostly in the back, could have been one of 42 nationalities, but they are nine Turkish victims. We can clearly imagine the mobilisation of the government in Turkey and the agitation of public opinion. Moreover, in the light of the actions, reactions and the pressure that Mr Erdoğan’s government is putting on the Israeli Government, today some would have us believe that this is a Turkish-Israeli issue and that it is nonetheless ultimate proof that Turkey has decided to turn its back on Europe and proof of its new foreign policy axis. Madam High Representative, I really would like you to clear up any ambiguity on this subject. It must be said loud and clear that it is a very good thing that Mr Erdoğan is being applauded by Arab public opinion because Mr Erdoğan is proving that using political instruments to act is more effective than violence and more effective than radicalism and extremism. I believe that this is a political lesson that we could encourage and support, and I call on you, Madam High Representative, to state this loud and clear. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, I would have preferred to hear from the rapporteur, Mr Tavares, but never mind; now he has finally joined us in this debate, and that is the main thing. I think that the work that he has managed to do to reach a consensus on the use of the European Refugee Fund, whose job it is to fund and encourage the Member States to develop their refugee resettlement programme, is exceptionally positive work, which Commissioner Malmström is strongly encouraging, and I am delighted to see that. We must nevertheless bear in mind a few figures, which will allow us to put the scope of this fund into perspective. If we were to allocate the entire European Refugee Fund – something that I do not want because it would inevitably be detrimental to the funding of the conditions of reception of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe – we would barely be able to resettle 20 000 refugees in Europe, a number far removed from the request of the UNHCR, which has established that there are more than 470 000 refugees worldwide in need of resettlement, that is, people who genuinely have specific needs, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and who cannot possibly return to their country of origin. We must therefore be sensible. To me, the second precaution we must take – because we have experienced this in my country, France – concerns the media coverage of the resettlement of some refugees as a tree of charity hiding a forest of malpractice, because at the same time, this country, France, has just been condemned by the United Nations Committee against Torture for returning asylum seekers to third countries where they risk facing inhumane or degrading treatment. I believe – and this is my final point – that these are the precautions that we must bear in mind. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, the Agency for Fundamental Rights reports that the Roma suffer every type of discrimination in every area, whether it be in relation to access to employment, to health care, to education or to housing. They are therefore the minority that is most discriminated against in Europe. In 2009, for example, on average, one in every four Roma was a victim of a crime against the person – specifically assaults, threats and serious harassment – on at least one occasion in the course of the previous 12 months whilst, at the same time, one in every three Roma was questioned by the police on average four times in the course of the previous 12 months. Their marginalised situation is compounded by their lack of awareness of their rights. This situation, which affects almost 10 million people at the heart of the European Union, which is now endowed with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and will soon be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, casts serious doubts over the policy of non-discrimination and effectiveness of rights, both at EU and Member State level. It took the racist violence in Italy in December 2007 to have a large-scale, high-level European mobilisation finally result in the organisation of the first European summit in September 2008. However, the call for a European Union framework strategy on the integration of the Roma, including a directive on the inclusion of the Roma, has still not seen the light of day. Member States – such as France and some others too – that maintain temporary measures for access to their markets for Bulgarians and Romanians are primarily penalising the Roma and must remove those measures as soon as possible as a sign of political goodwill. Member States must finally abandon the negotiation of bilateral readmission agreements with Kosovo, which are leading to Roma being returned to lead-contaminated camps in northern Mitrovica, as Mr Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, has been able to demonstrate. As regards the European Commission, I wish to remind it of the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2009 on the social situation of the Roma. In this year for combating poverty, I believe that we can at last decide to make the best use of our instruments and our Structural Funds with a view to resolving this serious situation.

 Mr President, firstly, I should like to welcome and congratulate Commissioner Füle. The 12th hearing of the trial of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink was held in Istanbul on Monday. For the first time, official observers at that trial felt that the court was sincerely trying to establish the truth and that the connections between this trial – that of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink – and other trials under way – such as that of the Ergenekon network – had been highlighted by the prosecutor. This fact is extremely significant because it is every political assassination, intolerance within society and the impunity that still prevails that are being put on trial here. Moreover, this is a view that the families of the victims of these political assassinations eloquently expressed when, referring to the Turkish ‘Deep State’, they declared themselves to be Hrant Dink’s ‘deep family’. I am telling you this because things are moving forward and because, within Turkish civil society, there is a desire and a movement for reform aimed at promoting democracy and rights, and this desire and this movement are exceptionally powerful. I should also like to cite another example which is making the headlines in the newspapers at the moment –family honour crimes have already been mentioned – and that is the young 16-year-old girl who was found buried in a chicken pen and who had been sentenced by the family council for having spoken to boys. This is terrifying and it is a crime. The members of that family will obviously have to be put in prison. The fact is, a few years ago, these crimes did not make the headlines. It is therefore pleasing today to see that these so-called ‘honour crimes’, which are simply barbaric crimes, are no longer being tolerated in Turkish society. Turkish society is in a state of flux, it is in turmoil even, and I think that, when we discuss Turkey, we must be keenly aware that any reform in that country deeply affects relations between citizens, the establishment, Turkish history and democracy. These are absolutely crucial elements. I believe that our process must be totally sincere. Today, the sincerity of our process is acknowledged, and it matches our ability to support the complicated, critical and historic process in Cyprus. Today, the EU must say clearly to Cyprus that we are ready to support and to guarantee, using all the means at our disposal, economic and financial means included, any agreement reached between the north and the south and that we are also determined to ensure that nothing in the body of EU law can hinder the achievement of a consensus in Cyprus. We must forge ahead; the future of Turkey’s membership of the EU is also riding on this issue. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, a question, yes, but which question? Addressed to whom and for what purpose? I believe that our delegation – of which you are a member, Mr Madlener – has committed itself and continues to firmly commit itself to human rights and gender equality and to every initiative taken to counter violence against women. I mentioned this just now in my speech. I believe that so-called honour crimes, which are crimes organised on a family or tribal basis, are utterly indefensible and that, today, it is very pleasing to see that no one in Turkey puts up with this type of archaic criminal practice any more. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, too, hope that everything is done at European level to encourage the Member States to assume their responsibilities and accommodate those Guantánamo detainees who have been proven innocent. They are victims and must be accommodated safely on European soil. Everyone knows, however, that the closure of Guantánamo will not stop questions being asked about human rights and counterterrorism, either in the United States or in Europe. In the United States, as you said, the antiterrorism law still permits unlimited pre-trial detention and trials before military courts. In Europe, well, the Guantánamo prisoners did not just fall out of the sky. I genuinely believe that there has been a failure to shed light on this subject. Mrs Hautala rightly spoke of the parliamentary investigation concluded on 22 December by Lithuania. It should be praised to the skies. It is exemplary. It must serve as an example. Conclusions were not drawn from these illegal practices on European soil, and I believe that that is the job of the European Commission; that is the job of the Council. We must draw every possible conclusion from the illegal practices which took place and which led to the opening of Guantánamo, a decision in which the Member States were fully complicit.

Mr President, I am disturbed by the speeches that I have just heard, from the Commissioner right through to my fellow Members. I feel that we really have our work cut out to gain an accurate and objective understanding of the present situation in Tunisia. Frankly, when I listen to you, I feel as though I am listening to western intellectuals talking cheerfully, many decades ago, about the economic and social success in the countries of the USSR, with a complete inability to go and see what our shared values stand for in practice in those countries. What are our shared values, Mr Michel? They are human rights, democracy and the rule of law. You have all rightly pointed out that Tunisia was our first partner to sign an association agreement. This is true, and that is why all this is very worrying, because we are not talking here about gaps, Commissioner, or about small steps. No. There is a huge, ongoing decline in human rights and democracy in Tunisia. Can you name one single newspaper, party or union that has been authorised in the last 20 years? No. The truth is that fundamental freedoms are being systematically and utterly disregarded, and, with them, our own commitments. This is not about moralising; this is about respecting the values of the European Union, and respecting the commitments that we made by signing this association agreement. Therefore, I demand that there be at least a shared analysis of this matter. I believe that we have worked hard to have this debate, but it would certainly be time better spent if we were to organise an actual delegation, one that really goes and meets this civil society in Tunisia and the various members of that society, in order to make an assessment of the continued harassment experienced by human rights defenders, students, trade unionists, workers and lawyers. There have been putsches in almost all of the associations that showed a certain degree of autonomy with regard to the authorities. I therefore believe that you are completely deluded on this matter. Having listened to your speeches, I well understand why you do not want to see the real picture in Tunisia. You do not want to see it because you believe that there are economic interests at stake, and because you believe that there are interests at stake relating to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration. You have expressed all this in the clearest of terms, and you go on about advances relating to equality between men and women and to the family, advances that date back to Bourguiba’s time. I repeat, these date back to Bourguiba. There has been no further progress since that time. I therefore believe that, if we have any respect for ourselves, for the agreements we sign, for the Neighbourhood Policy or for EU values, we certainly cannot propose an advanced status for Tunisia. Therefore, I tell you straight: if you propose that and renounce all requirements and all commitments in relation to human rights and democracy with all the countries of the Mediterranean, that will be the guaranteed outcome.

 Madam President, Commissioner Rehn, thank you for remaining with us at this late hour to discuss democratisation in Turkey, a subject on which you have done a great deal of work, for which I thank you. I believe that there were very many of us who, when the government announced its democratic initiative, its democratic opening-up, recognised just how bold a step this was and, at the same time, believed that this huge ambition represented a long road ahead, a road that would probably be full of pitfalls; the pitfalls appeared fairly quickly. The first act, as you said, was the dissolution of the DTP, but I also note that, alongside the ban on the DTP, the ban on engaging in political activity, which affects several elected members of its party, also eliminates the figures who were most heavily involved in the democratic and political dialogue to resolve the Kurdish issue. This leaves a question mark hanging over this decision. Next, there is also this wave of arrests which, today, are genuinely removing political leaders and therefore also the spokesmen on this Kurdish issue. Yet the Kurdish issue is central to the democratisation process in Turkey! Primarily because it is systemic, because it represents many years of suffering, violence, conflict and war, the tragic scars of which are still in evidence today; and these scars are also economic, social, cultural and political. This Kurdish issue is also placing a huge strain on the democratisation process. It is placing a strain on freedom of expression, on freedom of the press, on the rights of citizens and on the fight against torture. And when I see today how anti-terrorism legislation is being used as a cover for political reprisals, I say that now really is the time when we have to support the government and expect it to take another extremely ambitious initiative to emerge from this situation because, as we know, not all the established groups in Turkey are interested in a democratic settlement of the Kurdish issue. We are well aware of this fact, as we have been since the beginning. Therefore, Turkey now needs our support, our unfailing support in this process of democratisation. My fellow Member, Mrs in ’t Veld, is right to say that this unfailing support must include the renewal of that promise of membership once the democratisation process has been completed; it is absolutely crucial to say this. Next, the government will eventually have to produce reforms, which will inevitably have to lead to a new draft constitution. Immediate reforms will obviously relate to legislation on political parties. They will also relate to electoral reform – as a matter of extreme urgency – and to the independence of the judicial system. These fundamental pillars for a democratic state in Turkey must now be courageously and determinedly promoted by the Turkish Government. Moreover, this government must also implement initiatives to encourage consensus and reconciliation, because polarisation of society and of the political forces in Turkey would have a disastrous effect on the search for the consensus needed for the adoption of a new constitution, which we are all hoping for.

Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Malmström and the Swedish Presidency on their excellent conclusions. They revive the expectation that we all had, namely that it would be confirmed that the EU is indeed responsible for peace in the region under international law, and that, I believe, is crucial. Nevertheless, I am surprised that, one year after the military invasion of Gaza, no reference has been made, in these conclusions, to the follow-up to the Goldstone report sought by the Council. What stage are we at in the follow-up to this Goldstone report, to which the Council committed itself, notably with regard to the internal investigations involving the various parties concerned? Next, I am delighted that East Jerusalem is being considered as the capital of the future Palestinian State, or the Jerusalem of the two States. Nevertheless, these conclusions lack specific operational options. On the other hand, there are very many such options in the mission report by the Heads of State or Government who visited East Jerusalem. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to kindly clarify for us the specific methods by which, in fact, the European Union will neither recognise nor legitimise the annexation of East Jerusalem that Israel is currently seeking to achieve by, among other things, introducing economic measures, but also by orchestrating the mass displacement of Palestinian communities.

Mr President, I am talking here about so-called targeted sanctions, about intelligent sanctions, those that have a direct impact on fundamental rights too – the fundamental rights of individuals, organisations or legal bodies of any kind. These fundamental rights are important. They can include, for example, freedom of movement, but also protection of property. It is for these reasons that these targeted sanctions must comply with a number of minimum rules in terms of procedure and legal certainty. I would add, moreover, that respect for these legal and procedural rules is crucial if these targeted sanctions are to be credible and, therefore, effective. It was the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe – we in this House remember – that, through one of its then Members, Dick Marty, demanded transparency and the right of defence and which showed the absurdity of this lack of transparency where the effectiveness of listing and delisting was concerned. Listing and delisting were liable to affect innocent people too, people who were unaware of what was going on around them and unable to do anything about a situation that they generally stumbled upon by accident. That is why access to data, as mentioned by Mr Michel, communication of the grounds for listing, and protection in the transfer of personal data, are crucial elements of this procedure. Moving on, it nevertheless took a great deal of perseverance on the part of the victims of the United Nations’ and the European Union’s system of sanctions and the mobilisation of civil society, human rights organisations and also the European Parliament to have these victims’ rights recognised by the European Court of Justice. I would add that the Council’s amendments concerning blacklists depend on the proposals that have been made, including by the European Parliament. That is why the European Parliament absolutely must be involved in taking, implementing and monitoring these decisions, since history shows that it was the European Parliament that made the reform of the Council regulation possible.

 Mr President, the following is an extract from a letter written by William Bourdon, Taoufik Ben Brik’s lawyer, to Mr Sarkozy, President of the French Republic: ‘I have had the opportunity to denounce, as all his Tunisian lawyers have done, the legal farce which has resulted in Taoufik Ben Brik being sentenced, without in-depth examination, to a staggering six months in prison. I can unequivocally and formally attest to the fact that the dossier of the proceedings which led to this conviction was totally fabricated and was based on the personal vendetta of President Ben Ali. Throughout this year, 2009, he has been unable to travel since the fragility of his immune system is such that he is always at risk of being exposed to serious diseases. I believe that his family have succeeded in bringing him essential medicine, but I am not certain of this. His Tunisian lawyers have only intermittent access to their client, and some are systematically denied any possibility of visiting him. The only time that his wife has been able to see him was for a few minutes a few days ago, and she has been unable to see him again since.’ Mr President, please write to the Tunisian authorities to request the release of Taoufik Ben Brik.

Mr President, I agree, and so does my group, that the European Union’s enlargement policy is one of its most productive and most convincing policies. That is why, Mr Rehn, I am a little concerned for your future, because I am not entirely sure how you are going to be able to find a portfolio within the future Commission that is more attractive than that of enlargement. It is absolutely astounding to see what the prospect of membership can bring about as a force for change, for democracy-building, in a country such as Turkey. Yes, of course, there are still many things to achieve: the independence of the judiciary, a role for the army, freedom of expression, that all aspects of the Kurdish issue are genuinely dealt with once and for all, of course. However, I feel it is important to emphasise that this EU enlargement strategy is not just for the benefit of the countries that are going through the accession process; it is for our benefit and for the benefit of our European decision makers, too. It is irresponsible to diminish the efforts to change of a country such as Turkey by allowing doubts to remain about the outcome of the negotiation process. Yes, the outcome of the negotiation process will be that Turkey joins, and we must say so clearly. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that we are having a debate today on this issue because it is clear that the Heads of State or Government had expected the deportation of irregular migrants from the European Union to Afghanistan to be carried out without any fuss, and that is not the case. It is not the case for two reasons: firstly, because the European Commission has requested information from the United Kingdom Government and the French Government, which is a good thing, and, secondly, because we are having a debate on this subject today. Questions have already been asked. Is Afghanistan a safe country? Well, we should ask Mr Obama that, as he has just decided to send 34 000 soldiers there. No army is able to guarantee the survival of its men in Afghanistan, and are we supposed to be able to guarantee that the lives of the migrants that we send back to that country will not be endangered? This situation is a joke, and the UNHCR is not putting up with it either, as it has warmly recommended to the Member States that they do not proceed with deportations of this kind. Secondly, there is ambiguity surrounding collective expulsions. Everyone – and I most of all – welcomes the future binding character of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 19(1): ‘Collective expulsions are prohibited’. You tell us that this is not a collective expulsion. Mr Billström has a charming way of putting it, since he tells us that this is a reasonable mobilisation of resources. Soon, common charter flights are going to be sold to us in the same way as car pooling to combat global warming is. There are limits! And what are those limits? Well, I can tell you, as an elected representative from Pas-de-Calais, where there are many Afghans – who have given rise, moreover, to these deportations organised by Mr Besson in France – that, when the French Government decides, for communication purposes, to organise a collective return operation and to turn it into a media event, there are arrests in Pas-de-Calais: collective arrests, which are therefore illegal because they are discriminatory. Therefore, we absolutely cannot guarantee what you are saying, Mr Barrot, namely, that this is a joint operation for people who, following individual assessments, have been found to be irregular migrants. This is indeed a case of collective expulsion because there was a collective arrest. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, on Thursday, I was in Tunis for the trial of the poet and writer Taoufik Ben Brik, indicted in Tunisia on obscure common-law charges that fool no one. Since the ‘elections’ in Tunisia, held on 25 October, those who defend human rights have been subjected to an outburst of violence and harassment on such a scale as I have never before witnessed, familiar though I am with that country. On 25 October, President Ben Ali no doubt realised the full extent of the Tunisian people’s disaffection with their leader; and the embassies and the European Commission, which unfortunately does not have the political visa to attend this kind of trial, have displayed a general lack of interest in the issue that is unfolding. I think we must be very clear today. We are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue. What is stopping the embassies and the European Commission from rigorously questioning Mr Ben Ali – in the name of our binding agreements and mutual commitments with Tunisia – about his actions, which are entirely contrary to those commitments? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, something very simple is going to happen for our European Parliament with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon; we are going to have another 18 MEPs from 12 Member States of the European Union. We have been prudent because, in March of this year, the European Parliament asked all the Member States to anticipate this result by stating, as the method of appointment, that the elections on 7 June would be the democratic basis for sending these additional eighteen MEPs. Some Member States did so, like Spain and your country, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Other countries, which nonetheless state that they are very content, as am I, with the result of the Irish referendum and are keen to see the Treaty of Lisbon implemented, have still not done their duty, as far as their own will is concerned, by stating their method of appointment. Can we count on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to ask each Member State at the European Council on 29 and 30 October to state the method of appointment of these additional MEPs under the Treaty of Lisbon? The second thing that really shocks me is that everyone is talking about the grand ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it imposes an obligation on us in connection with one very simple thing: equality between men and women. This is a binding objective of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the Treaty of Lisbon. I understand that, for the additional two posts which remain to be filled, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and the President of the Council, only men’s names are being circulated. Your country, Sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question. I expect you to take this extremely seriously. It is not possible for us to only have men in the four major positions of responsibility in Europe. It is not worthy of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not worthy of Europe. I am counting on you to ensure that equality between men and women is respected at this level also. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, the last time we held a debate after a tragedy in the Mediterranean was on 1 April. You will recall that many hundreds of migrants perished off the Libyan coast. We had called for an investigation. To date we have received no information concerning the circumstances of that tragedy. Since then, as you know, in mid-August, 73 Africans were found dead off Lampedusa. On 25 August, 57 Eritrean migrants were finally rescued after a lengthy spell in Maltese waters. On 31 August, 75 Somalis were refused entry to Libya. Really, the external borders of the European Union have become murderous. This is the title of a report due out by the NGO ‘Migreurop’, which I invite all of you, ladies and gentlemen, to obtain and to read assiduously. Confronted with this situation, Mr Barrot, you refer to some key issues. You refer to the right of asylum, to the right to international protection. You should also refer to the right of any person to leave any country, and to the obligation placed on everyone to help others, whoever they may be. This is international maritime law. These situations are on the increase, and they are also occurring more and more at the border between Turkey and Greece. This is why I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that strengthening Frontex’s resources will be the answer to this situation. I believe that the European Union, today, is up against its own project. The European Union was born out of the refusal to deny others their dignity, and it is to this that it must remain true. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, this gives me an opportunity to clarify two small points which, I believe – and as one of my fellow Members said just now – highlight the hypocritical nature of our policy. The first point concerns the Dublin agreements. Commissioner, you know the situation in Calais well; you know that, in Calais, many people could easily apply for and obtain political refugee status. Why do they not do so? Because, as a result of the Dublin agreements, they are guaranteed to be sent to countries to which they do not want to go, and sometimes for excellent reasons. They do not want to go to Greece, where they have practically no chance of receiving refugee status. Today, the Dublin agreements are an instrument that is hostile to the protection of those people who need them most and which create inequality among the Member States. So let us stop talking about solidarity, when instruments are put in place that create inequality among the States. The second point concerns the readmission agreements. I fully understand, the aim is to negotiate these agreements with Turkey and with Libya, that is, to toy with the idea of having one huge environment of countries that are our neighbours and huge camps for holding the migratory flows. This is unacceptable for practical reasons, for moral reasons and for political reasons, and you know it, Mr Barrot! Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have a problem which means that I am not going to vote for you tomorrow, but you know what it is, since my group has explained it well. It is a political issue. You do not have a project for transforming Europe environmentally and socially. And yet that is, I believe, what needs to be done today. However, as Mr Daul elegantly put it, it was the right that won the elections, therefore you are on the right. The situation is clear. I should like, however, to be able to have respect for the President of the Commission, but I have a problem with this: when I see you, I inevitably think – and I assure you this is true – of your responsibility in the CIA’s secret flights. Between 2002 and 2006, 728 people were transferred to Guantánamo via Portuguese airspace. You were minister from 2002 to 2004. I therefore cannot believe you, Mr Barroso, when you make declamations about Europe being a champion of human rights. What I expect from you – what I hope for from you, because I would like, in the future, to respect you as President of the Commission – is not your memoirs, in however many years’ time, but that you will acknowledge your responsibilities in this serious act, which casts a shadow over European values.Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 This report on small-scale coastal fishing, artisanal fishing and the reform of the common fisheries policy is important because it underlines the importance of ‘small-scale’ fishing in the EU, particularly in terms of job creation, regional diversity and development, and because it marks Parliament’s general refusal to privatise access to fish stocks, refers to the need for a flexible definition of artisanal fishing (what is small-scale in the Netherlands is not small-scale in Greece) and supports the application of environmental and social criteria for determining access to fisheries resources and market distortion. However, the final version of the motion for a resolution crosses a line of acceptability in advocating support to cover sudden short-term increases in fuel prices. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is firmly opposed to support of this kind. I therefore abstained from the vote. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution, as it does not sufficiently address gender parity. One of its recommendations is that the Member States should propose both a male and a female candidate for the post of Commissioner, which is a positive step However, there is no requirement for gender parity in the drawing-up of lists or in the final results, even though this is of vital importance considering that only 30 % of MEPs are women.

 After a heated debate on shale gas extraction, and a great deal of back and forth in the Chamber, during which, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I expressed my strong opposition and outlined the concerns of developing countries, particularly in terms of land grabbing and access to water, fertile soil and food, which potentially call into question their food sovereignty. Today we voted on the two reports of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE Committee) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, at last adopting an EP position on this highly controversial subject. Although the ITRE report was in favour of shale gas, totally irresponsible and unacceptable, Mr Sonik’s report was more open to discussion. In the end, I abstained in the final vote on this report. The reasons are simple: on the one hand, this report rightly favours the adaptation of the European regulations, and demonstrates the EP’s desire to provide a framework for fracturing and to respond to the challenges; on the other hand, the moratorium, or more precisely the proposed amendment urging the Member States not to authorise any further hydraulic fracturing in the EU, was rejected. In any event, I am completely opposed to shale gas extraction. Catherine Grèze,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development

 Madam President, I am absolutely against the extraction of shale gas. These are matters that go way beyond our European borders with appalling effects on our water resources. Imagine yourselves what the consequences could be, and how devastating they could be, in developing countries where access to water is vital. But the extraction of shale gas is also about land grabbing and poor land quality; in other words, it brings into question food sovereignty in many countries. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, despite the publicity, despite the brazen lobbying that has been carried out even at the very door of the hemicycle, I would urge you to shoulder your responsibilities. We need a binding legal framework for European businesses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Catherine Grèze,

 Madam President, what an honour to have to reply to all of these questions! Regarding the point about which developing countries are carrying out research on shale gas extraction, as far as I know countries including South Africa and Morocco have already undertaken some research. But you can reply on multinationals the world over to seek out the last drop of a resource wherever it may be. On the issue of water, raised by my colleague, and the impact on water resources, it seems we have different sources of information. I saw an excellent film, Gasland

Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) has become a very important subject in the debate on EU development policy. The Treaty of Lisbon makes eradication of poverty an overall goal of EU development policy (Article 21) and, with the aim of achieving this goal, states the need for a coherent approach in terms of EU external action, covering trade, agriculture, fisheries, climate change and tax havens (Article 208). Unfortunately, the report in question is not an evaluation of implementation of PCD or its weaknesses. Rather, it is a report on what PCD should be. There are positive elements in the report, such as recognition of the right of developing countries to define their own policies by democratic means and to protect their economy. However, I could not allow myself, in the name, indeed, of genuine Policy Coherence for Development, to vote in favour of a resolution that encourages the expansion of agri-fuels in developing countries and supports agro-industry. That contributes towards land grabbing and runs wholly contrary to the notion of food sovereignty. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

This text rejects the arbitrary cuts proposed by the Member States for the 2013 budget. In its proposal, which Parliament supports, the Commission called for an increase in payments in order to meet budgetary commitments and outstanding payments from previous years. I abstained in the vote, however, because it supports the funding for the ITER nuclear fusion programme, a pipe dream that is a money pit for the European budget. At the same time, the report calls for cuts in certain lines, including some that are linked to development cooperation. I also voted in favour of amendments that sought to use the nuclear funds to finance programmes to dismantle plants, though these were rejected. I abstained on the amendments calling for a reduction in the subsidies for tobacco production. These reductions would have a severe impact on small farmers. Unless we call for a ban on the production and marketing of tobacco, this reduction would be counterproductive. Finally, I abstained, too, on the amendments calling for a single seat for the European Parliament. We need to have a real debate on that subject, not just a few amendments, as is the case here.

I voted for this report, which emphasises the European Parliament’s strong and united position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the years 2014-2020 in the run-up to the November European Council on this issue. The report reiterates our support for a 5 % increase in the budget in relation to 2013, that is to say, an additional EUR 100 billion. The multiannual financial framework is Europe’s only way out of the current crisis. Given the stakes, it must be up to the task and it must finance the commitments made by all of the European institutions, particularly in the areas of climate, development assistance, research, employment and the fight against poverty. In addition to the issue of the percentage, the other main problem is that of the EU’s own resources. In that regard, too, Parliament sets out a united position in favour of the creation of new own resources, such as the Financial Transaction Tax. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The European Parliament has just approved the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA), which will be annexed to the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel. This agreement, as adopted, does not guarantee that the products that arrive on our market will not be partly manufactured in the settlements, contrary to the provisions of European and international law. Let us not forget that the European Union condemns Israel’s settlement policy, which it considers to be illegal, and that it decided in 2009 to suspend any upgrade of relations with Israel (following the launch of Operation Cast Lead against Gaza). We are therefore sending out mixed messages, which are contradictory and difficult to understand. It is for this reason that I voted against the adoption of the agreement. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted in favour of the report by Charles Goerens on the future of development policy as it seems to me to be positive on the whole. The aim of the report is to refocus the discussion on the priority aspects of development policy, in particular the criteria for public development aid, independent strategic reflection, the issue of differentiation (emerging countries) and aid for local trade. I am particularly happy about the positive vote on the paragraph introduced by the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the Committee on Development, which aims to refocus aid for trade facilitation instruments, which currently targets the export sectors, so that it also supports local and regional trade.

 Until now, the number of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of energy is unknown, as Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of such agreements. According to the Commission, Member States are becoming increasingly obliged to accept regulatory concessions, which is incompatible with European law on the matter. In addition, as the Commission does not know exactly how much energy is being imported, it cannot provide for market fluctuations or the means to alleviate them. Consequently, the Commission has proposed to put in place an information exchange mechanism with regard to energy agreements with third countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tried to strengthen the proposal by allowing the Commission to have access to agreements before they are signed, in order to be able to advise Member States on their compatibility with the law. Such a measure would also strengthen transparency. The Member States did not want this, and the rapporteur did not seem to care, preferring a bad agreement to no agreement on the subject at all. I personally voted against this text. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently three quality labels for agricultural products in the European Union (protected geographical indications (PGI), protected designations of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG)). The Commission wishes to reform this system in order to simplify or facilitate new entries, in particular. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it was important to take advantage of this overhaul to promote the introduction of a new ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label. We also called for the introduction of a ‘mountain’ label to highlight the considerable added value of products from these regions, where agriculture is often traditional and extensive. These two measures were passed during the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we are pleased about that. However, during the negotiations in trialogue with the Council and the Commission, the Members representing Parliament sacrificed the ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label, which is nonetheless important for encouraging these kinds of agricultural practices. That is why I voted against this text, which was initially encouraging. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Although the free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia/Peru should be ratified shortly, Parliament has just voted on a text establishing safeguard clauses for the banana sector. The safeguard clauses enable us to temporarily reinstitute normal customs duties or to suspend tariff liberalisation. The text recognises that there are problems in terms of employment rights in the countries concerned, although this recognition is not sufficient. The rapporteur also calls for greater consideration of social and environmental aspects within the framework of the forthcoming economic liberalisation. The Commission must understand this message. Moreover, the texts clearly state the need for greater consideration of overseas countries, where bananas are a pillar of the economy. This vote should not make us forget that the real issue for these regions is a transition towards a more diversified and more sustainable economy.

 The matter at issue here is the future of the seas. The Salavrakos report deserves to be supported for its long-term perspective on the sustainable development of fishing in the EU, but we cannot allow it to be watered down in this way. I shall explain what I mean by this: Amendment 2, which was adopted with the help of the regionalists who swung the vote, has destroyed the call to allow fish stocks to increase to levels above those capable of producing a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This means that the EU has failed to meet even the requirements of international law. I therefore ended up voting against this text, for, although it does take account of some important aspects (ceilings for the renewal of fleet, areas for repopulating fish), it does not take sufficient account of numerous points including overfishing and the objectives set by the common fisheries policy.

 The Commission is proposing that Member States grant decoupled support to vine growers under the direct payments scheme. In practical terms, that will allow Member States to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the common agricultural policy (CAP) direct payments scheme (first pillar). That is positive, as the payments will now be granted for an indefinite period, which will allow small farmers to predict their incomes over the period and therefore gain stability. The introduction of this mechanism will, however, require some adjustments. This resolution will allow Member States to test this new mechanism for a period of one year prior to its definitive implementation, if they so desire. That is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this resolution which makes recommendations for improving animal welfare in Europe. Despite the fact that unfortunately it does not call clearly for a reduction in transport time, it does limit the duration of transport of live animals to eight hours as requested in a recent petition on this matter. Similarly, the text calls for the inclusion of animal welfare standards in trade agreements signed by the EU. Although this resolution is not perfect, it is a first encouraging sign which, I hope, will lead to a genuine proposal for a regulation from the Commission. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The Council conclusions are mixed. Symbolically, they point towards greater solidarity and integration, the only means of tackling this interminable economic crisis, which is a good thing. However, only around 10 billion of the 120 initially promised by the Compact for Growth and Jobs are genuinely new and additional funds. Furthermore, the conclusions still have ‘growth’ as their leitmotiv. This is seen as the sole remedy to all our economic ills. This rhetoric is unacceptable as far as we, as ecologists, are concerned. What we should be questioning is our model of development as a whole and we should bear in mind the fact that resources are finite. The conclusions of the Summit do not do this, or do it very little. Given these mixed findings, I abstained from voting on this resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I signed this resolution calling for all public consultations to be translated into all of the languages recognised by the countries of the European Union. There is a European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that calls for resolute action to be taken to promote these languages, to prohibit any form of discrimination against them and even to facilitate and encourage their use in public life. This resolution responds precisely to this last point. Such a measure would encourage citizens to address the European Union. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 We have been asked to express an opinion on reprioritising our development cooperation with Latin America. I voted in favour of Mr Cortés Lastra’s report as it highlights the need to move towards renewed cooperation with Latin America. This is a chance for the EU to stop with the neoliberal policies of the past. Promoting growth does not provide prosperity for all. Social cohesion is key to this process. Growth and the fight against poverty cannot be systematically linked. The EP will soon be questioned about its approval of the free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru and on the association agreement with Central America. They go completely against the objectives of our development policy. The European Commission has always mistakenly interpreted development policy through the prism of international trade. It is time we turned this logic on its head and focused mainly on coherent development policies in any agreement. The report rightly points out the need for all EU policies to be coherent and for systematic compliance with environmental and social standards, while including civil society.

 As regards this road map for energy cooperation with third countries, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance succeeded in having a number of amendments incorporated, notably on reducing dependence on imports through greater input from renewable energies, the need to align the long-term climate and energy policy objectives, the need to ensure sustainable energy supply at local level in developing countries, and the need to be more sceptical about the use of agrofuels. However, I could not vote for this report, which promotes shale gas and oil sands and which supports projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

 I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe as it was essential for us to send out a strong message against the homophobic laws that have been recently adopted, or are in the process of being adopted in certain countries, particularly at the very heart of Europe, where homosexuality is criminalised. The European Parliament, as a great defender of fundamental rights, had a duty to examine and condemn these extremely worrying laws that demonstrate the increasing homophobia that can be seen today in Europe. It is utterly scandalous that the authorities should justify these laws by saying that they are necessary to protect public morality, while they restrict freedom of expression and are totally discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. How is it possible to consider demonstrations, support for, or the mere acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as ‘homosexual propaganda’? For the first time since the last European elections, all of the main political groups have come to an agreement: we are saying ‘no to homophobic laws’ and we clearly condemn any discrimination, hate speech or violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

 We had the opportunity to prevent the disappearance of bluefin tuna, and the EU, the main exploiter of this species, also had the opportunity to assume its responsibilities. It is regrettable, however, that the European Parliament did not succeed in adopting more ambitious measures to address the plight of this iconic endangered species. The new legislation, which I certainly could not vote against, is only the bare minimum, but it will at least make it possible to enforce existing international standards. Although the European Union has just complied with the commitments made within the framework of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), we are still far from taking the necessary measures. Measures should have been taken, for example, to close zones to fishing, especially during the spawning season. In addition, stricter measures should have been adopted concerning illegal fishing and overfishing in particular, in order to fill certain gaps, which are currently exacerbating the problem of the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It may not be too late, and the EU will once again have the opportunity to enforce more stringent regulations this November. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this report recommending the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) at EU level and therefore supporting the draft directive presented by the Commission last September. The FTT is an excellent instrument for raising new revenue to finance stimulus policies. It is one of the best ways of going beyond the austerity policies that are leading Europe straight into disaster, driving too many of Europe’s citizens into poverty and leading to political and democratic stalemate, the magnitude of which is still not being acknowledged by some. However, I regret that the European Parliament has granted an exemption to pension funds. It is the wrong signal, especially since these funds – which are long-term investors – are only marginally affected by the tax, which mostly penalises short-term players. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted against this report, as it calls for special attention and financial support for regional airports, without a single condition with regard to security or even the environment. Before the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed various amendments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving multimodality (better coordination with rail transport) and developing better cooperation between regional airports that are geographically close to each other but are situated in different (cross-border) countries. These amendments were all rejected, leaving me with no choice but to vote against the report. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

Whilst the remit and functions of the European Environment Agency may not be on a par with those of other agencies for whom a postponement of discharge has been requested, it does have the task of providing reliable, independent information on the environment. If there are any doubts about the transparency of certain funding or about conflicts of interest, I believe we must take the time to iron them out. That is why I voted in favour of postponing discharge. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Amazonian countries are confronted with illegal mining, which is synonymous with the ecological and social violation of indigenous territories, with tragic consequences. At the end of August, Survival
, an NGO, provided information concerning the massacre by miners of several dozen Yanomami Indians on Venezuelan territory. Today, however, the Venezuelan Government believes there to be no evidence. Since then, voices have been raised, including that of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, denouncing the lack of will on the part of local authorities to conduct an investigation and calling for an in-depth investigation. I hope that the European Union will expressly call on the Venezuelan Government to shed light on this tragedy to the fullest extent. However, those of us who are directly concerned, through our overseas territories, send a strong message calling for the full recognition of the rights of indigenous people. Starting today, let us put an end to the illegal exploitation of mineral and forest resources. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 days ago, we were hoping that Rio+20 would be the summit that would destabilise those who profit from greater inequality and deplete our resources. We are bitterly disappointed at the lack of binding objectives. However, this should not divert us from our commitments. If we want to see future progress in the negotiations, we need to prove that the fight against poverty and for sustainable development is the true objective of EU development policy, and we need to do so through the allocation of ambitious financial resources. Let us make a commitment to implement, without delay, innovative financing mechanisms, such as the financial transaction tax, and to redirect a substantial proportion of revenues towards development aid. Let us fight more effectively against tax havens and their hoarding of the fiscal resources of those countries through the excessive use made of them by transnational corporations and, in particular, the extractive industries. Only then can we become credible advocates of sustainable development for all. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some satisfaction that I present this report on tax and development to you tonight. It represents an important stage in a battle that began a long time ago, which I am now pursuing in the European Parliament. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Development, with whom the work has been extremely productive. I hope that it will find confirmation during tomorrow’s votes. Developing countries have been very badly hit by the financial and economic crisis and the rising prices of agricultural materials and now need substantial new sources of funding more than ever. Amid this context of global crisis, tax revenue, which is the oldest source of development funding, is a major issue and a genuine challenge. Effective taxation systems not only provide funding for vital public services. By promoting the transparent, responsible use of government revenue, they are also one of the foundations of a responsible democracy. Contributing towards raising equitable, progressive and transparent taxes should in no way lead to removing or reducing official development assistance (ODA). It should not provide a further excuse for Member States that are increasingly inclined to reduce their share of GDP which is devoted to ODA. Whilst ODA may be imperfect and have much room for improvement, it is no less vital for countries that have been severely affected by both economic and climate-related crises. It is not a question of replacing aid, therefore, but of redirecting it towards developing effective taxation systems, to which the multinationals must contribute on the basis of their actual profits. In this way, poor countries will be able to take ownership of their development once again, reduce poverty and compensate for the loss of customs revenue caused by the liberalisation of the markets, so that in the long term, they will be able to manage without foreign aid. However, the countries of the South are not only victims of their own ineffective taxation systems. They are also victims of the tax dumping imposed by the Bretton Woods bodies, of the cost of illicit capital flight, and of tax havens. Every year, they sustain colossal losses of tax revenue estimated at over ten times the amount of aid they receive from rich countries. This report emphasises this fact. As for the OECD guidelines, far from being adequate, they actually pose a threat. By allowing non-cooperative jurisdictions to be taken off the grey lists simply by signing cooperation agreements without imposing any automatic exchange of information, they are creating the illusion that tax havens are legitimate and conferring credibility on a system that is harmful to public finances in North and South alike. Putting an end to tax havens is a vital step towards these countries’ development, and the European Union must make it an absolute priority. The EU must shoulder its responsibilities as the United States has done and produce clear, binding legislation coupled with genuine sanction mechanisms in order to put an end to tax havens, which are like weapons of mass destruction for the development of poor countries. The EU must prevent profit and transfer price manipulation by companies, especially European companies, which both benefit from and abuse detrimental taxation systems. It must impose the introduction of a transparent, binding international mechanism that will place a duty on all multinational companies, especially those in the extractive industries, to automatically declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. This is a vital first step towards stopping those who are getting rich on the back of the Southern countries’ misery. It is also a vital step towards restoring the European Union’s credibility. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these partnership agreements between the European Union, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo should, in principle, turn out to be good news for these populations, and good news for biodiversity. However, this is only one stage in a long process which the European Parliament will follow closely. If we want this agreement to allow for the introduction of a regulated, transparent and environmentally friendly timber trade which benefits local populations, rather than a few groups of dubious legality, the European Union must ensure that the rights of the local and indigenous populations are fully respected and that the latter actually participate in the consultations. It must help strengthen the capabilities of all those involved; it must contribute to the fight against corruption and to the introduction of real forest governance. The agreements must not be a pretext for continuing to pillage the natural resources of developing countries. Rather, they must help restore a balance in relations between the European Union and these countries. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, following our visit to Gaza from 26-28 May 2010, our delegation unanimously called for an immediate, total and permanent lifting of the blockade imposed by Israel. Our joint resolution was born out of this unanimity faced with this humanitarian and political tragedy, and I hope that a large majority will vote for it. Conveying our message with one voice is not just necessary, it is vital, because it is precisely unity that the European Union has lacked until now and it is precisely unity that it needs today in order to carry weight and to make its presence felt as a major and credible actor for peace. For Europe, the worst thing would be if the flotilla tragedy were to be followed by indifference and inaction caused by a lack of unity. There needs to be a political reaction by Europe. It no longer simply has the right, but the duty, to act and hold talks as well as to condemn and impose sanctions when peace is threatened by one side or the other. Madam High Representative, we have a huge responsibility today. We can no longer content ourselves with reconstructing buildings time and again. We must build peace and we must do so now. That demands courage and firmness. You must build alliances, with the United States and Turkey in particular, and you must not relieve the diplomatic pressure on Israel until the complete lifting of the blockade and the setting up of an independent international inquiry become a reality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to Mr Domenici’s efforts, the report on which we have to take a final vote this week is a high quality document. I sincerely hope that it will be adopted on Wednesday at our plenary sitting. Many of the advances that it contains on the issues of financial transparency, fiscal policy and the fight against tax havens, the major consequences of which are rightly stressed here, are simply without precedent. First, we should welcome the fact that the text acknowledges the considerable limits of the fight against tax havens as it has been carried out until now. Tax treaties and the OECD lists of non-cooperative jurisdictions, to reproduce the terms officially in use, are unsatisfactory and even represent part of the problem that they are meant to be solving. That is why the proposals in this report, which aim to go beyond this approach, to adopt a new definition of tax havens and to introduce new tools – including sanctions − to help in this fight are hugely important. This is obviously the case for the proposal to introduce automatic exchange of tax information, both within the European Union and at international level. It is also the case for country-by-country accounting, which the report is demanding and which will make it possible to measure the real activities of companies in the countries in which they are established and to verify that they do indeed pay the taxes which they legitimately owe there. These are two fundamental demands which have long been supported by many experts. We can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is adopting them and, in so doing, will become one of the institutions that is most involved in this fight. Ladies and gentlemen, the problem of tax havens is not a mere technical issue. It relates to fundamental choices. Do we wish to give developing countries the means to benefit from their own resources instead of seeing these confiscated? Do we wish to ensure that all of our companies and our fellow citizens contribute within their means to the financing of civic life? By voting for Mr Domenici’s report, we will be giving a positive answer to these two questions. An answer of which, I believe, we can only be proud. On a personal level, I would like to thank Mr Kovács for the seminar that we jointly organised in Brussels on 9 December to put this subject on the agenda. Thank you and good luck. Eva Joly,

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this new humanitarian crisis that Haiti is enduring is perhaps on a greater scale than all previous ones, so much so that I doubt that it is possible to find the right words to talk about the victims, to speak to the survivors and to reach out to families in order to tell them how much we share their pain and are aware of our responsibility. However violent the earthquake was, it alone does not explain the extent of the damage. The latter is also linked to the chronic poverty that Haiti has endured for many years. Until now, the international community has been incapable of changing anything there. Worse, by imposing policies on Haiti that we now know did not work, international institutions, Europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric, its economy and its institutions. In the 1970s, Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned. It used to produce 90% of its agricultural needs. Today, it imports more than half. This must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production. Before this earthquake, Haiti was a country without resources because it was deprived of the resources to which it was entitled. We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies. From this point of view, we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place. In future, we must improve our procedures. However, we must, above all, be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong. We must proceed by calling our own methods into question, and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term. The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti, and the Member States have done the same. We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term, and EUR 200 million for long-term needs. I would like to compare these figures to other figures, to the USD 155 billion that the banks of the City and Wall Street are getting ready to pay to a few thousand people who work in the banks. That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level. Urgent humanitarian aid is necessary, but it alone is not enough. It must not, under any circumstances, supplant development aid, which itself must not be experienced by the countries that are supposed to benefit from it as a veritable diktat. The first way of assisting countries in great difficulty is to continue to respect them, to allow them to benefit from their own resources. We must cancel Haiti’s debt and pay off our debt to that country. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head. (Applause) Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face: the economic and financial crisis, the social or food crisis, climate change, energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty. The dominant economic model that is the unbridled free market, and our lifestyles, have not just shown their limitations, but have actually caused these unprecedented multidimensional crises. We must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies. The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision. The main imperative to respect is consistency. European Union trade policy, fisheries and agriculture must be designed consistently and in such a way as to ensure sustainable development, to fight poverty and guarantee a decent standard of living and income for everyone. I am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today. By making trade an end in itself, and not a means to serve its development policy, the European Union is sacrificing the populations of developing countries for the benefit of its multinationals. Therefore, negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements are quite rightly causing controversy amongst the governments of the ACP, unions and civil society, which see them as a threat to their economies. Agriculture is one of the most problematic issues and remains tragically neglected in cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries. Although rural areas and this sector represent more than 60% of the population and their jobs, their share of the European funds for ACP countries is virtually non-existent. This must change. How can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority? Agriculture must be at the heart of the European Union’s development policies. Helping developing countries together with local farmers to ensure they have food sovereignty is quite simply essential, all the more so because, today, food sovereignty, like the democratic legitimacy of these countries’ governments, is threatened by a new and particularly worrying phenomenon, the acquisition of arable land by foreign investors following the rise in food prices in 2007. China, Saudi Arabia and even Qatar now own thousands of hectares in developing countries. The European Union and the ACP countries must tackle this matter, which is likely to create violent conflicts and hunger riots, in particular, by making access to natural resources such as land and water a fundamental and inalienable right of local populations. Another matter that is close to my heart is that of tax havens. The repercussions of these are bad enough for developed countries, but are even worse for the economies and the political institutions of developing countries. The illicit financial flows that they allow are thought to account for as much as ten times the amount of official development assistance. Stopping this haemorrhage is a question of consistency and credibility. A first step could be the signing of a binding agreement, requiring multinationals to automatically declare their profits and the taxes paid in every country in which they operate, thus limiting the abuses and the losses sustained by developing countries. Finally, I would like to use this debate to stress once more the democratic deficit of this revision, which our parliaments were not consulted on. The role of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly must, however, be strengthened. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the negotiators will seize the opportunity they are being given to make the necessary amendments to this partnership and to make it a success of which the principal beneficiaries will be the populations of the ACP countries. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Cotonou agreements, poverty has not subsided. We have therefore failed in our development mission. Something has to change with this second revision. I am pleased to say that there is a fairly broad consensus on the measures that I am proposing, and I think that one of the measures that we can use to eradicate poverty is to really combat tax havens, and to use this instrument to do what we can. Within the European Union and in the ACP region, we can force multinationals to declare, on a country-by-country basis, how much they earn and how much tax they pay. That is also an international demand. However, many years will go by before this demand is met at international level. So let us use the opportunities that we have within this agreement to establish this rule in Europe. This is why I am asking you to reject the proposed amendment to paragraph 16, but to preserve the initial wording, which calls on us to put our own house in order. In the same vein, what we can do is also force our own investment bank to take action with regard to tax havens. We should prohibit European Development Fund investments in companies that do not make profits in the countries in which they operate, but prefer to make profits in tax havens. This was the case in Zambia, where very substantial investments – to the tune of USD 46 million, I believe – were made in the Mopani mine, for example. This has done nothing to improve the lives of Zambians; rather, it has improved the lives of the shareholders who have benefited from this aid. It is therefore totally counterproductive. This is within our power. We can change the mandate of our bank. Let us therefore do what we can and put nothing off until tomorrow. Let us take action in this regard. Then, there are principles to which we should remain totally committed: human rights and migrant rights, and I urge you to retain my proposed wording of Article 31 and not quell the protests against bilateral agreements which, in reality, constitute an outsourcing of migratory flows. (Applause) Eva Joly,

Mr President, Mr Carlgren, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the world’s future will be at stake in Copenhagen, but before that, it is the credibility of the European Union, as the global leader in the fight against global warming, that will be at stake at the end of October in Brussels. The Member States must make climate-related financing proposals that are proportionate for a tragic situation. Together with the commitment – which I hope will be ambitious – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the issue of financing and of reducing and adapting to climate change in developing countries will represent a major theme in the forthcoming negotiations. The figures speak for themselves: 100 countries, most of them poor, account for only 3% of global emissions. Although developing countries have contributed the least to these greenhouse gas emissions, they are already the worst affected. According to a recent report by Oxfam, 26 million people have already been forced to migrate due to the effects of climate change or other forms of environmental damage. By 2050, these climate refugees could number more than 200 million. The effects of climate change could destroy the progress made in some developing countries and could quite simply prevent the Millennium Development Goals from being achieved. This is therefore not a question of charity. It is a question of us accepting our full responsibility and laying the foundations for a fair and peaceful world. The European Union’s current strategy is unworthy of the ambitions declared by the leaders of environmental diplomacy. It must lay its cards on the table now in order to relaunch the negotiations. The Union cannot reasonably pledge less than EUR 35 billion in public finances. It goes without saying that these funds can only supplement those already pledged for official development assistance, all the more so because the commitments made in this area are not always honoured by our Member States. Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our planet is in our hands. If we do not stop the damage being done to our environment and the inequalities, we can fear the worst. We have a choice between an ambitious and proactive Europe and a timid Europe that is aligned with the United States, which cares little about the fate of developing countries. I urge you to make the right choice. Eva Joly,

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, democracy and human rights are inextricably linked. It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised. We must therefore welcome the fact that, on 19 May, the Council indicated that the European Union had to adopt a more consistent approach to democratic governance. The efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a striking example of this. Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock. Where is the European Union’s consistency and credibility when its own decisions contrast so sharply with its much-vaunted principles? And what can be said of the Member States that refuse to endorse the Goldstone report? Its conclusions are fair and balanced, and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace. It is this hope that the major powers are destroying, and they are destroying it through their lack of courage and their lack of loyalty to their own values. Organising election observation missions is therefore not enough, especially when one refuses afterwards to acknowledge the result. We must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues. The Council should swiftly adopt a programme of action along these lines, with the creation of a genuine strategy for human rights, which would be imperative at all levels of the EU. We need to outline our priorities clearly and integrate them formally into all of our instruments: foreign policy, human rights policy and development policy. What kind of monitoring will we carry out in those third countries in which the European Union observes the elections in order to ensure respect for political pluralism and the involvement of civil society in the long term? What are our demands as regards the establishment of an independent judiciary and of institutions that are transparent and accountable to their citizens? The persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive. It is time to clear this up if we want the European Union and its most fundamental values to be taken more seriously at international level. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea. The violence that was used against the opponents and, in particular, women, is utterly appalling and unacceptable. I wish to express my support for the victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones’ remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre. In addition to the current measures being initiated by the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the Guinean Government by rejecting the Report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Guinea, which we will vote on during the next plenary session. The Committee on Development already unanimously rejected, in September, this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea, expressing doubts over the use of the funds allocated by the European Union. Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population, the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims’ wounds are still fresh. Doing so would send out the wrong message to the Guinean Government. It would be a scandal which I cannot bring myself to endorse. Eva Joly,

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, while I have the pleasure of putting this oral question to you on behalf of the Committee on Development, sadly I do not have the pleasure of presenting you with the resolution on the same subject, adopted unanimously by this committee. My colleagues from the Committee on Development and I worked tirelessly to ensure that the resolution was voted on and debated in plenary before the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. However, apart from my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, no other political group supported our request to put this resolution on the agenda, and yet it is vital if we want the European Parliament to play more of a part in defining the European Union’s external policy and to have real strength behind its proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, of what benefit will it be to us to vote on this resolution, which was to put the European Parliament’s requests and proposals to the members of the G20 and, more specifically, to those of our Member States who sit on it, as well as to the European Commission, at the October plenary session, that is, after the Pittsburgh Summit? Besides the fact that this devalues the work accomplished, we cannot be content with this role of current affairs commentator either. That is not our job. Let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism: journalists. Developing countries need us now more than ever. While our fellow citizens have not been spared, the global economic and financial crisis has had a far more lasting effect on the populations of developing countries. However, the financial institutions have not made these populations the main beneficiaries of the emergency loans, since very few of them satisfy the required conditions. The countries of Africa have thus received only 1.6% of the loans granted by the IMF since the last G20 meeting in London and the increase in the IMF’s resources. The rest has gone to developed countries, European ones in particular. Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course, but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility. Public development aid must be increased as a matter of urgency. Already, most of the Member States do not meet the conditions required by the OECD since 1970, and we are facing new emergencies without having new funds. We must therefore find new sources of funding, not least by reforming the current system. The Committee on Development is asking you to take action to eradicate tax haven abuses, tax evasion and the illegal flows of capital from developing countries. According to a Norwegian report published in June, the figures of which have been verified, the illegal flows leaving developing countries are ten times the amount of our development aid. This shows just how much is at stake. There is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay, on a country by country basis, in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. Moreover, a radical reform of the system must take place involving, in particular, the introduction of new democratic and transparent regulations for trade and the international financial systems. The responsibilities are huge, the challenges many, and the task arduous, but, now more than ever, the European Union must step up to the plate and lead these reforms. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I will use the brief time I have available to express my group’s support for the report by Mr Ferreira. In our opinion, it has at least two advantages. Firstly, it focuses on a vital fishing sector that is often overlooked and sacrificed: small-scale, artisanal and coastal fishing, which is the sector in which most European vessels and fishermen operate. Secondly, this report puts the problem of small-scale fishing at the heart of the reform of the common fisheries policy. If, as we hope, the new fisheries policy is based on sustainable fishing criteria, the interests of artisanal fishermen will be guaranteed and consolidated. We will only be able to ensure the future of thousands of small-scale fishermen, and with them the global food supply to which they make a vital contribution, if we have a fisheries policy that is firmly focused on conserving marine resources, and protecting and renewing stocks. Jean-Paul Besset,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I have to say that I am fairly satisfied with Mrs Damanaki’s response on this issue of the consequences of rising oil prices for fishermen. This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity – and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay. We therefore cannot provide a short-term, circumstantial solution by increasing subsidies in line with the fluctuations in oil prices. This is a question of political logic. The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy. Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools. Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, on behalf of my three fellow Members, Mrs Pietikäinen, Mrs Sârbu and Mr Davies, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 410 Members of the European Parliament who signed Written Declaration 71/2010 on support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning, which we tabled. Indeed, this fragile species, like many others, is subjected to a veritable massacring at sea as a result of finning practices and the discarding of carcasses at sea following that mutilation. Thank you for having overwhelmingly signed this Written Declaration. It sends a strong signal to the Commission to bring about the strengthening of regulations to protect this species. (Applause) Jean-Paul Besset,

Mr President, I should like to focus my speech on Mr Luhan’s report. Regional cohesion policies have a key role to play in Europe for economic development that is balanced, socially harmonious and ecologically effective, that is, at the end of the day, globally competitive. I thank Mr Luhan for including some of our amendments aimed at establishing a sustainable low carbon economy which safeguards biodiversity. Nonetheless, we cannot vote for his resolution because it promotes a vision of cohesion policy as an instrument for global competitiveness that still appears to us to be too narrow, too restricted and inadequate. We must point out two sticking points. Firstly, the rapporteur relies almost exclusively on quantitative measures in terms of infrastructure as the driving force for growth, increase being his main criterion. We do not feel that is appropriate for the current situation. For example, he mentions 246 operational programmes in research and development and is proud of these, but without questioning what they are about. Research is a good thing but we also need to know what it is that we are researching. The second sticking point is that the rapporteur does not put forward sufficiently clear plans. We would have liked a robust choice in order to meet the challenges set out in his report, the choice of a green economy, of a green new deal which is the only choice capable of moving Europe and its regions upwards. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to an aspect of this resolution, which is of central and not secondary importance to me, and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning. The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds. It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this ‘targeted approach to territorial development’, to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach. What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies? Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth. However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product. People’s well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve. If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view. To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions – which, I would point out, is our shared objective – the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres. It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment.

 Mr President, the rather forbidding title of Mr Sterckx’s report introduces a very important issue, which goes far beyond the administrative and technical matters that the title implies. It deals with an important political decision, namely, making the maritime transport sector more attractive, more efficient and more competitive. In our view, this is the sector of the future and provides the best means of transport from an environmental point of view. Mr Sterckx’s excellent report and the contributions of all the shadow rapporteurs will allow us to make significant progress in this field. From our point of view, this directive hits the mark: it will increase the level of harmonisation within the maritime transport sector, making it better coordinated and simplified. We will therefore wholeheartedly support this report when we vote on the matter, even though we would have liked to see it implemented faster and to see more strength of resolve with regard to the introduction of a common language in that sector. However, we think that the compromises achieved with the Council are still acceptable. We therefore unreservedly support this report. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, I agree with the content and conclusions in the report by my colleague and friend Mr Romeva i Rueda, and I welcome the collective work that has been done on this report. The report is based on a reality that is now unavoidable. Bluefin tuna is under threat of extinction as a species, and many fishermen, an important economic sector and a vital food resource for mankind are at risk along with it. I would like to emphasise what this situation will really mean and the shock it will cause in relation to the period in which we currently live. For it is indeed a shock. For the first time, there is a clear threat to a major consumer product that is known to all, available on supermarket shelves and consumed by us all. It is a clear signal: the sign of a change of era. Protecting bluefin tuna is now a major early warning sign from the environment, and the significance of that warning goes far beyond the single issue of bluefin tuna. The threat to fish stocks and their much-needed protection are now the symbol of humanity’s entry into a new era of scarce resources: fish resources, food resources and energy resources. The key words should no longer be waste, overproduction and overconsumption, but saving, sharing and caution. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports Mr van Dalen’s report and recommendations. He offers us a balanced text which is the result of the close collaboration he managed to establish with the other political groups. We endorse this report because it clearly sets out the challenges facing the EU’s maritime policy, namely a significant increase in maritime traffic, both inside and outside the Union, without sacrificing the environment or social issues. This text is consistent with a rationale that we wish to see applied in all areas: a policy of sustainable development. It offers positive paths to allow maritime transport to develop between now and 2018 in the best possible conditions. In particular, we highlight the fight against abuses of flags of convenience or substandard vessels. We also highlight protection against piracy. We highlight having a policy designed within the framework of a single European sea, and the importance ascribed to the multimodal linking of European sea ports with the hinterland. We highlight the support for simplification of the administrative rules governing entry and exit from European ports. We highlight the promotion of maritime occupations and continuous training for them. Lastly, we highlight the priority given to environmental issues. On the whole, we will always support anything which, in our view, helps to promote a maritime transport sector which can compete with road and air transport. Mr van Dalen’s report has taken full stock of the global environmental challenge, for which maritime transport is one of the solutions. In particular, it is a useful tool against global warming. Our only regret is that the amendment that we tabled in order to integrate the maritime transport sector into the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system has not been taken up by the rapporteur or by the Commission. From our point of view, no economic sector should depart from the general rule, and, as with the air and road sectors, maritime transport, even if it is only responsible for low gas emissions, must do its part to reduce them. We will therefore be retabling our amendment to plenary. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, nobody has mentioned this yet, but something important happened on Sunday when the World Bank published its report and announced that the Earth will be more than four degrees warmer by 2060. Given that it is the World Bank saying this, I think it is safe to say that the situation is very serious. It means in practical terms that if we want to prevent this from occurring, we need to go from 35 billion cubic metres of CO2
 in 2050 to 10 billion. This requires very strict measures, not simply just to lower our emissions but to actually reduce them by a third or a half. This means that when we are dealing with this European and global issue today, we cannot simply chase after easily available energy sources if we want to avoid the effects of global warming. I say this because today everybody knows that methane has an effect on global warming 30 times greater than that of CO2
, and between 4 to 8 % of methane escapes between the wells and the pipes when extracting shale gas. This applies to all forms of methane, obviously. It is therefore a key issue. Finally, to give an example showing the need for European regulation, I went to visit a shale gas well near Wrocław in Poland operated by Halliburton. There was nothing to capture the water. Fracking had occurred and the water had just been released into the environment. That is why we need proper legislation and a moratorium while it goes through. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we are currently experiencing a situation where production is increasing by more than 2.5%. At the same time, industrialists are lowering their prices. In Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and throughout European countries, prices are falling. This clearly means that prices are linked to production volumes and that we must organise production volumes as well as prices. At the same time, today, producers are falling victim to an increase of more than 44% in the price of vegetable proteins and 30% in the price of cereals. Parliament has already voted on the need to ensure that added value is distributed among producers and that farmers do not become the victims of companies and large-scale distribution. I would therefore ask the Commission today, but also the Council, to once again call into question controls on production, but at the same time, and I say this very clearly, Member States must get their own house in order because there are countries which have respected the quota rules and others which have not. This is another reason why these quotas have been called into question. There is therefore a double responsibility on the part of the Commission and the Member States. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Blue-card question.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Deß, I understand what you are saying and I am entirely in agreement with you. I have a very specific question on this subject. In the documents that I have managed to collect, I see that in Germany, while there are normally price negotiations between milk producers and buyers, industrialists, cooperatives and so on, Aldi – which is today a large-scale distribution group – has unilaterally decided to lower the price of a litre of milk by six cents. At the same time, all the other ‘hard discounters’ have just done the same thing. How do you explain the fact that, in Germany, large-scale distributors can set prices while, normally, according to the mechanisms put in place by the European Union, there ought to be discussions between industrialists and producers? We can clearly see that today there is a problem in the rules for setting milk prices. How do you explain this? José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I should like to speak about the issue of granting discharge to agencies and specifically, the European Food Safety Authority. More than two years ago, I questioned Mr Dali about a possible conflict of interest concerning the President of that agency, Ms Bánáti. It turned out that I was correct: yesterday, Ms Bánáti was forced to resign on the eve of the forthcoming vote. Since she resigned, she has been recruited as director of the largest international agri-food lobby, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which brings together all the companies in the sector. We now have a genuine problem. Everyone is aware of that, including the director of that agency herself. We need to take a close look at the issue of conflicts of interest and the transparency of assessments. The same goes for medicines. Today, I am asking to postpone the vote on the discharge, not for financial reasons, but, very specifically, to ask the Commission to introduce clear rules in favour of transparency and against conflicts of interest.

Blue-card answer.
 – (FR)
 I think that this is a positive move, but it is not enough. We need clear rules. We do not, however, have clear rules on conflicts of interest at the moment, not only for the appointment of management boards, but also for the appointment of experts. That is why I think that we have to take our time. If we refuse to grant this discharge, we shall have an historic opportunity to create transparency so that there can be no ambiguity about these agencies. I am in favour of the agencies and their development, and also of an increase in their state funding to avoid conflicts of interest with the private sector. I am campaigning today to strengthen the agencies, but that can only be done by combating conflicts of interest and ensuring transparency. José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, let me make a statement of fact: our citizens increasingly want to find and consume locally produced and seasonal food, for health and quality reasons in particular. We have to find ways to enable farmers to meet this growing demand effectively and quickly. We have to support the establishment of local infrastructure for producers, such as maintaining local abattoirs which, while guaranteeing rigorous sanitary control, facilitate the development of local short food supply chains and strengthen direct selling. Support for local agriculture and direct selling should help producers sell their products and bring them to the attention of consumers. Stronger direct relations will enable farmers to retain more of the added-value created on their farms. Direct selling within the farm must be promoted and facilitated and support must be given to the collective actions of farmers who want to open collective points of sale enabling them to offer local consumers a wider range of products. The Commission must facilitate the emergence, sustainability and development of systems of selling through direct delivery to consumers, such as the Associations for the Preservation of Smallholdings (AMAP) in France, which enable approximately 3 000 farmers to supply 60 000 families. Finally, Member States must be able to add other criteria concerning, in particular, the size of the farm, the volume of production or the traditional character of the product in order to define local agriculture.

rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. I simply want to say that the report on the free trade agreement bears my name, and as there has been a vote in favour of the agreement within the framework of the Committee on International Trade, the report continues to bear my name, and I urge you to vote against this report. Those who are against this agreement should vote no, not yes. I just wanted to clarify that. José Bové,

 Mr President, in view of the outcome, I submit to the majority and withdraw my name, of course. In any case, I wish to thank all my colleagues in Parliament who have taken part in the debate, because it is very important to have held a debate on international trade for the first time. We need to continue along those lines. I hope the Commission will take into account the debates that have taken place. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, there are some saying today that this project has nothing to do with the common agricultural policy. I tell you this is not the case. What is now very clear is that the objective of the common agricultural policy was to ensure food security, to make sure that products are affordable for all consumers, ensuring farmers’ income. Feeding all the citizens of Europe is therefore part of the fundamental charter of the first integrated European policy. When we can now transfer money from the CAP balance to fund the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) to the tune of almost EUR 500 million, how is it that, in some States, some are questioning the EUR 500 million to help the poor? We have now reached an agreement until 2014. I think that after this, there will need to be a link between the CAP and welfare systems to ensure that the poorest have access to this food. We are committed to this and I hope that in terms of agricultural policy, special efforts will be made so that the poorest can also directly access production. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Nicholson on the courage he displayed when facing the Council and the Commission. Nevertheless, I fear that the end result does not strike a balance between producers and manufacturers. This agreement reminds me of the children’s tale about a paradise where vegetarian lions would lie down with lambs and eat grass. I do not believe it for a second! From 2003 Ms Fischer Boel did everything in her power to destroy the milk quotas from an ideological perspective. In October 2009, despite these efforts, the Court of Auditors recognised the effectiveness of the milk quotas. Today, however, we find ourselves in a situation that is going to be even worse and we can see what is already happening in Denmark, where the most solid farms, with rising production, are all going bankrupt, with a 40% reduction in land prices. Do we want to see the same thing right across Europe? Surely not! We need to control production with the participation of the public authorities. José Bové,  
rapporteur

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU–Morocco agreement encourages both sides of the Mediterranean to concentrate on capital-intensive corporate farms at the expense of family and peasant farming. The rise in the number of quotas at reduced rates for a wide range of fruit and vegetables makes it difficult for EU producers to continue to compete, but at the same time does not help the development of balanced agriculture in Morocco. Labour costs are the principal factor determining the price of fruit and vegetables. Morocco has an undeniable advantage today due to the widespread use of child labour and the ban on agricultural workers forming trade unions. Workers in Morocco earn around EUR 5 per day, compared with EUR 50 in Spain. How can we cope with this type of competition and this social dumping? Respect for trade union rights and a ban on child labour are essential preconditions for ratification of a new trade agreement with Morocco. The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is a cause for concern among EU producer organisations. The problems with the system allow operators to reduce the import duties they pay. The European Commission has never equipped itself with the means to combat this type of fraud and it needs to resolve this issue before proposing a new agreement. In Morocco the way in which export quotas are managed favours large groups. In the tomato sector 70% of Moroccan exports come from just three groups. Moroccan family-run farms do not benefit from this agreement. According to a study funded by the European Union, the Abu Dhabi Tiris Euro Arab investment fund obtained 700 000 hectares in the south of Morocco to plant and harvest citrus fruits, olives and market-garden crops. The monopolising of land, which is so shocking to our fellow citizens, is also happening on a large scale in Morocco. In the Souss region, where tomato growing is concentrated, the water table is falling by two metres per year. In Western Sahara agri-businesses are drawing on coastal ground water. This irrigation results in the salinisation of fresh water, jeopardising the local population’s drinking water supply. Exporting 350 000 tonnes of tomatoes is equivalent to exporting 35 million cubic metres of water from Morocco to Europe. The social, environmental and economic effects have not been assessed by the Commission. We are still waiting for the impact study. A study is required to allow Parliament to reach a decision in full knowledge of the facts. We have never allowed an agreement to be adopted before identifying its social, economic and environmental repercussions. I have raised the question of the territorial scope of the EU–Morocco agreement. A number of countries, including the United States, have signed free trade agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco that expressly excluded Western Sahara. This was done so as not to influence the outcome of international negotiations being held under the aegis of the United Nations to enable the various parties to find a peaceful settlement. As the Commission and Parliament’s Legal Service hold diverging views on this issue, we cannot guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that this free trade agreement will comply with the international treaties that are binding on the European Union and all of its Member States. Consequently, the European Parliament should reject the agreement. That will enable us to reopen the negotiations on a new footing. I think that it will also send a strong message to the Commission to change its working method by allowing the European Parliament to participate from the initial stages of the discussions among the parties. The European Commission must produce concrete, serious impact studies on the economic, social, environmental and budgetary effects of the agreements it is negotiating. We can no longer accept the fact that Parliament only has the option of saying yes or no. I must inform you that, contrary to the opinion adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which opposes the agreement, the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade is to approve the agreement between the European Union and Morocco. I am bound to state that publicly. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the arguments that I have just set out, you will no doubt realise that I am asking you very clearly to vote against the conclusion of this agreement. This is not just in the interests of European farmers, who are unanimously opposed to the agreement right across the trade union spectrum, but also, and above all, it is in the interests of Moroccan farmers, who are today being deprived of their land by large exporter groups and who, because of this unbalanced agreement, are going to have their meat, dairy and cereal production capacity destroyed by imports by large European groups. I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject this agreement, which is a bad agreement. By rejecting it, we will reopen the debate but we will not prevent the previous agreement from continuing. It is thus simply the extension of the agreement that I am asking you to reject, in the interests of farmers on both sides of the Mediterranean. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, we have just had a debate that, in spite of everything, was interesting because for the first time it was a real debate on a free trade agreement. Some people referred to the facts, others to ideology, even belief, belief in free trade as a stepping stone to democracy. I hope that those people do not find themselves one day in a situation where they have to face the people who have suffered because of free trade agreements, of any kind: today the peasant farmers who produce fruit and vegetables, or tomorrow the meat producers when it is time for the Mercosur agreement. I believe that this free trade agreement is a bad agreement, especially for Morocco’s peasant farmers. If the ‘yes’ vote prevails on Thursday – which is of course possible as I do not know what will happen – it will mean that you are creating all of the conditions for the Arab Spring to arrive finally in Morocco. That means that you will be in a bit of a strange situation tomorrow. In fact, the agreement provides for an increase of more than 50% for European products on Moroccan territory, compared with just 15% for Moroccan products in Europe, which means that hundreds of thousands of Moroccan families are going to be thrown out on the street because of these exports to their country. Is that what you want? I get the impression today that you are not talking about the reality. You refuse to talk about the reality. We are accepting this agreement because Morocco is promising to protect us from the immigration from Africa. That is what is happening and it also features in all of your texts. Are we concluding economic agreements solely to build a wall on the other side of the Mediterranean to protect Europe? We have to get serious! We have to get back to the actual facts, and the actual facts all come down to agriculture. However, this agreement is a bad plan for agriculture. A 1% increase in volume over what is offered could lead to prices collapsing. As you are all too aware, Commissioner, the balance between supply and demand is very fragile. A 1% adjustment can make prices collapse and have devastating consequences. We know that Perpignan is currently a key transit point for tomatoes. We know that the head offices of the two largest firms, Azura and Idyl, are located in France. We know that today. So why are we continuing in this manner? We also know that the Commission has internal EU documents that show that more than 700 000 hectares were given to the Persian Gulf fund. You cannot deny that today; it is the Commission’s own documents that prove it. We need to get serious when it comes to the issue of water, too. We are told today that there is no information about water, even though European universities, in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, in addition to Moroccan universities are providing figures. I do not need to say any more. As regards our obligation to Western Sahara, I did not want to turn it into a political battle, but simply to raise a point of law. Indeed, the law is clear-cut. If Western Sahara is not excluded from this agreement tomorrow, you could face the possibility of action before the European Court of Justice. José Bové,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2010, Parliament adopted the report by the Committee on Agriculture aimed at ensuring fair revenues for farmers. In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other. The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work. On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation. The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources. European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products. We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production. In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions. Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances. However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc. The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves. Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP. The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm. Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource. This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing. Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers! José Bové,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important. The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain. Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial. Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, now that this text has been adopted, I think that it is important to point out that a collective effort was made on the part of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and that, thanks to this collective effort, we shall be able to step up the pressure on the Commission and the Council to ensure that, finally, farmers in Europe are taken into consideration, both in terms of their costs and their income. I should therefore like to thank this Assembly for that and to thank my fellow Members who helped me draw up this report, in particular, Mr Lorensen. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not want to repeat what everyone has already said, but I believe that, today, Europe does in fact have a real problem of credibility as a result of what is happening. We are being put on trial. We are being told, on the one hand, that there is the European policy and, on the other, that there is the policy of the Member States. However, if the Treaty of Rome of 1958 tells us that we must ensure that all Europeans are fed and that we must guarantee food security, this is a European policy. It is not a policy of the Member States Today, this situation shows, in addition to the selfishness of a number of Member States, that what is lacking is not more Europe but rather a European will on the part of a number of Heads of State or Government. At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the European Commissioner, Mr Cioloş, who, in an opinion piece published in the Le Monde
 newspaper, had the courage to say that this policy was essential for the poorest Europeans. If we are incapable of challenging the decision of the Council, Europe will be disowned by its citizens. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I wanted to speak as we met in your country, in Warsaw, with the delegation from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, when we decided to speak on a number of very specific issues. It was pointed out, with regard to climate, that the Polish Presidency was somewhat cautious and did not want to make this issue a priority, as the Durban climate change conference is taking place at the end of the year. The European Parliament has very clearly stated the need to reduce CO2
 emissions by 25% or even by 30%. Yet, when it comes to environmental safety, I unfortunately do not sense the same will from you as you asserted this morning – which I was pleased to hear – regarding energy security and food security. Environmental security seems to be just as fundamental to me and we will not have one without the other. I think this is a central point. On food security, I would like your Presidency to be more active. Yesterday, the European Parliament said very clearly that countries should have the right to opt out of cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately, while we were voting on that, you changed the law in Poland on 1 July to allow GMOs in, under pressure from Mr Barroso. I would like you to enable this procedure in order to ensure that countries have the right to resist, as you have done for many years. Another point, now, at the end of the year … (The President interrupted the speaker)
 … the meeting of energy ministers is going to take place; I would like you to take into account the requirement to have a policy for a moratorium on shale gas. (Applause) José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lepage, I think that the rapporteur has tried to do the best she could do in a bad situation. The European Commissioner has presented a proposal for renationalisation, which has been a total failure from a legal point of view, because, as we have seen, the legal services of Parliament and of the Council said that this solution was contrary to competition law and would pose major problems at an international level. So proposing to Member States now that this debate can be taken up again without a clear legal basis will create more problems than it will solve. I will be brief. Commissioner, what I want to hear from you today is a very clear statement on whether you will commit yourself to integrating into European legislation the rules that will be adopted by Parliament in the context of the revision of the directive on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do agree that, as well as liberty and fraternity, there should be equality for farmers and the new Member States in Eastern Europe. Yes, I agree with you. I think that this report marks a huge step forward. It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational. However, the important thing is that we reached a consensus. This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision, and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament’s great strength. We have succeeded, despite the difficulties, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and all the Members. The first phase is complete. In this document, we have reiterated the need for equality, justice and fairness for producers and regions. I think that is important. We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms, that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity. In my opinion, this was another fundamental point. The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts. We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations. This is not a question of ideology. Lastly, at present, we are worried about the real budgetary threats. We need to come up with unequivocal responses. What we want now is to move into the second phase, which is obviously the legislative debate. Why? Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going. That is essentially what we are waiting for. Let me close, however, by expressing my fury at Germany’s attitude. It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe’s poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount. That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget. I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat. José Bové,

 Madam President, Commissioner, as in 2008, the price of agricultural raw materials is soaring on world markets. We are only at 3% of the 2008 level. The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission. The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day. Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line. Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States? Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets. This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators. The impact is also dramatic for European farmers. They are no longer able to feed their animals. Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300. This is a whole new ball game. The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well, today, to follow its own advice. Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions. The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions. Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price. Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices. Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, a year ago, you told me that GMOs had polluted your first term of office and that you wanted to refer the issue back to the Member States. A few days ago, 1 200 000 signatures were collected from European citizens asking for an independent expert report on GMOs. A few days ago again, the Environment Council rejected Commissioner Dalli’s proposal by a very large majority. The opinions of both Council’s and Parliament’s legal advisers have also been negative. Lastly, you have witnessed the scandal at EFSA with the Banati affair and the questions raised by the panel. What is more, EFSA itself has decided to issue new assessment guidelines. What I would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations, such as that of MON810, until the new EFSA rules have come into force? New assessments and authorisation renewals should be processed according to the new rules. Finally, are you willing to relaunch the debate so that we can get an independent assessment? José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Thank you for your answer. However, EFSA has already put in place new guidelines that are much stricter. Are you willing to agree that all new authorisations that have been granted over this latest period and the issue of MON810 should be reviewed in the light of these new guidelines? We cannot accept assessments today that were carried out on the basis of old rules. That is why I am asking you this question very precisely and I would like you to start this whole debate again from scratch, instead of waiting until 2012. Directive 2001/18/EC is due to be updated in 2012: the process needs to be brought forward. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago. Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month. Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe’s small-scale agriculture before we act? Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo – is that right? On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers. It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price. The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers’ organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors. Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility. Next week, Commissioner Cioloş will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers. Europe’s credibility is at stake. Europe needs every single one of its farmers. José Bové,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for their support in this task. This report, like the one by Mr Lyon, is part of our major debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We have managed to reach a large number of compromises, which have been adopted by a large majority in our group – by 32 votes to 4. I believe that our message to the Commission is a powerful one: we all want greater transparency in the food chain and legislation that guarantees fair competition between farmers and all operators in the food chain. We also want concrete measures, in Europe and elsewhere, to combat speculation and abuses of market power and to safeguard farmers’ revenues. I am surprised that, on the initiative of one or two political groups in this House, we are being asked to vote tomorrow on a long list of separate votes, which go against the powerful and consensual message that we adopted by a large majority in committee. Could it be that events over the summer have made you change your minds? I rather think that the intense lobbying carried out in recent days by the large-scale distribution sector and certain operators in the agri-food industry is the reason for the excessive number of separate votes. In any case, I cannot imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that you would give in to such pressure in order to weaken our common message. Our committee has taken stock of the crisis affecting European farmers. It intends to propose concrete, strong measures: in less than 10 years, the Union has lost 3.5 million farming jobs. It is a massacre on a terrible scale. Bulgaria, for example, has lost one in two farmers. In 2009, revenues plummeted. In France and Germany, farmers have lost 20% of their revenue on average, and in Hungary, they have lost more than 35%. Farming and rural communities are in danger of disappearing. Forced as it was by the exasperation of farmers and by the demonstrations of dairy cattle breeders, in December 2009, the European Commission published a communication entitled, ‘A better functioning food supply chain in Europe’. The latter shows that, between 1995 and 2005, the proportion of the added value of the food chain that went to agricultural producers decreased from 31% to 24%. The prices paid to farmers are falling in virtually every sector, without European consumers benefiting as a result. The Commission says that these problems are linked to increased concentration in the wholesale, processing and distribution sectors, which impose their will on unorganised producers. The Commission is concerned about the lack of transparency in relation to pricing and margins. It recognises the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data, and admits that it does not have the information it needs to adapt its policies quickly and effectively. To remedy this, I propose that the Commission creates a European farm prices and margins observatory, on the model of that which exists in the United States. This body will be responsible for defining European farmers’ production costs. It will tell us the real costs of a litre of milk, a kilo of wheat or a kilo of beef from the moment it leaves the farm. This information will serve as a basis for negotiations between farmers and the other operators in the food chain. This body will also be responsible for assessing which sectors claim all the added value, to the detriment of producers and consumers. The European Commission would thus be able to identify which operators are abusing the balance of power and abusing their dominant position. It also seems crucial to make the 20 largest European companies draft an annual report on their market share and the internal margins they generate. Transparency poses no threat to the market economy. On the contrary, it is an absolute necessity in order to prevent the abuses that have been observed in agriculture and in many other sectors, in particular, that of finance. Who can claim that, when farmers sell their milk or their meat, they are on an equal footing with multinationals, which influence commodity price building on the global markets? The balance of power is completely unbalanced, and some would say unfair. In order to restore the balance, a first emergency measure would be to allow farmers to come together within producers’ organisations. The second, additional measure involves prohibiting selling of goods below purchase price at Community level. Forced discounts, subsequent alterations to contract terms, and unjustified listing fees are a common occurrence. They are hitting farmers and the thousands of small and medium-sized processing companies hard, because they have to go through the large-scale distribution sector in order to sell their products. The European Commission must take stock of the extent of these anti-economic practices, and it must take the measures required to stop them. Lastly, speculation on agricultural commodities is a scourge. Financiers and speculators are looking for instant rewards and instant profits. For them, poverty, hunger and famine are synonymous with profits. We did not think that we would relive the 2008 riots, but we could not have been more mistaken. Since June, the price of wheat has risen by more than 70%. The prices of maize, soya and rice are also on the increase. Last week, seven people were killed in Maputo, Mozambique, for demonstrating against the 30% increase in food prices. Are we going to continue to stand by and do nothing, as we did two years ago? Are we going to continue to put up with investment banks bankrupting European farmers and crushing the men and women of our planet? I call on the European Union to take the initiative to create a global agency to regulate the markets. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to send out a strong message so that the new CAP is fairer for European farmers and consumers and so that there is fair competition between operators which allows for the creation of a framework for regulating the markets and which gives short shrift to speculators. It is the responsibility of the European Parliament, as it prepares to exercise its joint decision-making power in agricultural matters, not to submit to any pressure, from wherever it may come. Our message must remain clear and consistent. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I am pleased with the debate that we have just had, in which a very large number of Members were able to speak. It is true that, at this time, on the first day of the part-session, there are rather too many of us for this debate, which shows just how interested all of the groups are in the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The important thing for me is that the report that we have debated, the text that is going to be voted on tomorrow in this House, is a joint text. This has been mentioned by a number of speakers. I am the rapporteur, but this text has been drafted jointly within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I think that that is very important. Everyone came with his or her own idea or story, and we came up with this proposal together. I feel it is important to emphasise this. It is my name that appears on this report, but it is a joint report, and I wanted to reiterate that. Several speakers stressed the need to safeguard farmers’ incomes through the sale of their agricultural products. That is the very foundation of agriculture. Farmers are paid from the sale of their products, and so to say that, today, farmers cannot sell below production cost is an essential, indispensable condition if we are to continue to have farmers in Europe in the future. Agricultural policy makes it possible to support, to maintain agricultural activity across regions, and to combat distortions linked to natural handicaps or to the regions. Therefore, the fact is that there will be no common agricultural policy if farmers cannot earn a living from their production in the first place. Farmers are the ones making the strongest calls in this regard, and Parliament has just successfully repeated their demands. The second point that I feel emerged clearly from our debate just now is the need for transparency all along the food chain. All the speakers came back to this point at various levels, in particular, with regard to the processing sector in negotiations with producers, or with the large-scale distribution sector, which, often, for example in the case of fruit and vegetables, creams off unbelievable profits. Today, all that is acknowledged; this need is no longer in doubt. Many speakers also focused on the issue of speculation; I am not going to go back over it. Therefore, I would say that, once the vote has been held tomorrow in plenary – and I believe that all the speeches have demonstrated the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s collective will to table this report and to convince all of our fellow Members – once the text is adopted, once it is voted for tomorrow, the ball will be in the Commission’s court. Moreover, I should like to say to the Commissioner: it is now up to you to take action. This is an initiative that we are taking. We are making proposals to you. Our expectation, of course, is that this work will now be taken up by the Commission and the Council, since it is clear that Parliament alone will be unable to do anything. On the other hand, by working together, we will be able to build a new common agricultural policy. Above all, however, we will be able to give hope to European farmers. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, first of all I would obviously like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lyon, with whom I believe we all worked on the basis of mutual agreement to try to move forward, and I would like to say briefly, in just a few words, that the evidence is there for us to see. The evidence is that, today, Europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials. We must have an ambitious agricultural and food policy so that we can ensure that our citizens’ food needs are met. Furthermore, today we have a CAP that must be reformed for three reasons. It is a CAP that is unfair, economically, socially and environmentally. Economically: the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must allow for this problem to be resolved. Socially: aid is unfairly distributed between countries, regions and farmers. Eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20% of farmers. Environmentally: we need a CAP which respects the soil, which respects … (The President cut off the speaker) José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, reopening negotiations with Mercosur when the European Union is getting ready to redefine its agricultural policy reveals a dangerous lack of consistency on the part of the Commission. Europe already imports 500 000 tonnes of beef. Opening up our market even further would be to the disadvantage of the cattle breeders of Europe’s less-favoured areas, without any guarantee of respect for health and social standards. We cannot accept this. Europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle. These imports from Brazil and Argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares. They are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises: Cargill, ADM and Bunch. Between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1.2 million hectares of tropical and equatorial forest. It is one of the principal causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity. The European Parliament has decided to produce a report on the recovery of autonomy in respect of vegetable proteins for livestock feed. This decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change. These efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement. Once again the European Commission is selling short its farming and its farmers in order to obtain chance gains for service companies. These concessions will not serve the interests of the farming families of Mercosur, only those of agro-industrial groups. Convincing evidence of this can be found in the report by the Tyson group, a US corporation and heavyweight in the international meat market, which announced that it has invested in Brazil – I quote, and it is in its report – to use this country as a platform for exporting to Europe. Other enterprises, such as the Doux Group, had already anticipated this move by buying out the Brazilian Frangosul Group in 1998. Many poultry farmers, particularly in Brittany, paid the price for that deal. Europe seems to want to pursue its policy of relocation by intensifying its attacks against farmers. We must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality, locally produced food. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against hunger demands a substantial political and financial investment. The Food and Agricultural Organisation was unable to generate that investment last week in Rome, and I regret that. More than a billion people suffer from malnutrition and 40 million men, women and children die of hunger each year. These dramatic figures have risen since 1996, the year of the first World Food Summit. The global financial and economic crisis has aggravated the situation, and the populations of the countries of the South are the main victims. Ten per cent of the advertising budget worldwide would allow developing countries to be given the necessary support to safeguard their agricultural infrastructure. The food crisis is one of the main threats hanging over peace and stability in the world. In 2050, small farmers will have to feed more than 9 billion people. Soil damage, damage to biodiversity, oil dependency, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and the development of consumption patterns put us in a very fragile situation, more fragile than 40 years ago. Poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity. The need to support local production is obvious. At the end of the 1950s, Europe introduced the common agricultural policy in order to produce the food it needed. To do this it protected its internal market and supported its consumers. This autonomous choice, this right to food sovereignty, must now be accessible to all the countries or groups of countries throughout the world that want it. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, please excuse me, I was supposed to come earlier, but I was tied up. I was explaining to French listeners what took place yesterday in Luxembourg. I believe that the Council’s decision is a bad one, since the only word to appear in the text is ‘restructuring’. In France, we have gone from having 480 000 milk producers in 1984 to having fewer than 88 000 today. Today, we are told that yet more producers must be forced out and that the money that will be recouped – this appears in the text – will be used for producers who have exceeded their quota. Production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out. This is the wrong approach. The money that has been given, the EUR 280 million – the figure has already been quoted – equates to EUR 50 per month and per farm, for one year. That is peanuts; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through. Lastly, on the subject of Article 186, I should like to say that, at a time when we are moving towards codecision in agricultural matters, it is unacceptable for power, for a blank cheque, to be handed back to the Commission. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for months now livestock farmers have been warning the Commission and the Council of the gravity of the crisis. Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas. The European Union had counted on growth in world demand. Its experts got it very wrong. The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption. The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council’s wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers. Times have changed. European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment. The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs. On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents. At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money. Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives. In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly. We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers. The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry. It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs. The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme. It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets. It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate. Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand. A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable. It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns. Without the small farmers, there will be no Europe. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we are all saying the same thing: the employment situation in Europe is catastrophic. With one quarter of young people under 25 unemployed, there is a lot at stake for the new generation, which refuses to be a lost generation. The Commission has opened up the way with its employment package, which is designed to create 17 million jobs by 2020. However, it continues to lead us towards disaster by driving through austerity plans which increase unemployment and condemn the most vulnerable to the worst kind of hardships. Yet, an exit from the crisis is simple. We must transform our economy ecologically and socially. To that end, we need to develop green, sustainable and non-outsourceable jobs through targeted investments in green, innovative industries. We need to invest in life-long training and in promoting the social and solidarity economy. In addition, it is necessary to promote decent work, taking into account the objectives of the International Labour Organisation of improving rights and working conditions, and to reaffirm the vital need to increase the minimum wage so as to put an end to the scandal of poor workers and to fight social dumping. We have the means to end the scourge of unemployment. Yes, it is possible! What, then, is lacking? All that is lacking is the political will. That is your responsibility! Mr Barroso accorded high priority to the issue of youth and youth unemployment in particular. What is the youth unemployment situation now, three years later? There are no specific proposals. There is nothing. Action needs to be taken and it needs to be taken now. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, in its proposal for a regulation covering all the Structural Funds, the Commission has earmarked a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a future food aid scheme for the most needy for 2014-2020, despite fierce opposition from a minority of Member States within the Council. This is a brave decision by the Commission and one which is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, but, more importantly, with those of most of our fellow citizens. This is at a time when, with the worsening of the social crisis, increasing numbers throughout Europe are calling upon help from food banks. It is a brave decision, but it is not enough. At present, the food aid programme for the most deprived is worth EUR 500 million per year. By proposing a budget of EUR 2.5 billion over seven years, the Commission has consciously reduced this budget by EUR 1 billion, even though the demand is continuously increasing. In addition, we know nothing of the Commission’s intentions in terms of how the future programme will be introduced. If the funds are allocated within the framework of the European Social Fund, it will be difficult to continue buying food on the agricultural markets to distribute it to the most deprived because of the way in which the social fund is managed, especially since this practice has been condemned by the European Court of Justice. However, if no solution is found, the food banks will find themselves in a situation that they have managed to avoid until now. What do you actually intend to do? I, for one, believe it is necessary to maintain a decent budget for this programme and to ensure that each and every one of us, especially the most deprived, has the right to healthy food at an affordable price. Lastly, I believe an effective safety net is needed, as is a strong framework directive on a minimum income. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Commissioner, more than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. It is therefore with a certain amount of relief that we welcome the new extension of the European food aid programme until 2014. The poorest will continue to receive the essential charitable support that they need at a time when the demands faced by these charities are growing. Yet the real question is what next. What will happen after 2014? Is it not just lip service the promise to reduce poverty by a quarter in the EU by 2020? We must give ourselves the means to achieve this goal. That is why we will ensure that the new financial framework preserves this programme as part of the cohesion policy to ensure that those Member States in need do actually benefit from this aid. However, there is one condition: this transfer to the ESF should also be allocated a large enough budget to ensure that no-one is left by the wayside. What is at stake here is the matter of solidarity between the European people. One final point, Commissioner, the poorest are also entitled to a healthy and balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. Karima Delli,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, I am angry. Here we are two years after the consensus conference rightly piloted a European strategy for the homeless under the Belgian Presidency. The European Parliament drafted a written declaration in favour of the homeless. No response. I drafted the resolution in favour of a European strategy for the homeless. The Commission did not respond to our request, which remains a dead letter. I am sorry that today there is no one on the Council’s bench, while it is the Member States’ responsibility to ensure the right to housing assistance for all those who do not have sufficient resources. In two weeks, the spell of very cold weather has killed over 600 people; this has already been said. I say it time and again: the homeless do not only die in winter. All year round they sleep on the streets and all year round they have their rights trampled on. European citizens expect more from the European Union today. It must be united and active faced with the distress of the most vulnerable people. The situation is more than worrying. I will give you a few examples. In Greece, the number of homeless people has increased by 25% in two years. In Hungary, the homeless are persecuted by the police and threatened with heavy fines. In France, we are seeing decrees which criminalise begging and stealing food from bins. Where is this headed? We are seeing it more and more: austerity policies led by the governments will have disastrous consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, let us demand a shake-up, a wake-up call. We can change things. I will say it very clearly, Commissioner; the European Union must play its part for solidarity between the Member States and the European people. We must urgently bring together the ministers concerned. The time for saving the banks is over. It is now time to save lives. We have already waited too long. Each Member State must make the Commission aware of the measures it has put in place since the cold spell began. We must mobilise an emergency fund immediately to come to the aid of the most vulnerable people. The Member States which do not respect their obligation to provide emergency assistance to the most impoverished must be sanctioned, particularly those which criminalise the homeless or prohibit access to emergency shelters for certain groups of people. Finally, Mr Barnier, the Commission must put in place a European strategy for the homeless immediately. The aim is clear; we have discussed it here; ladies and gentlemen, no one should be sleeping on the streets by 2015. This is an emergency. In order to dream, you must have somewhere to sleep. If we let it, this glacial silence from European representatives will lead to distrust among the citizens. You really need to react … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) needs this debate. This instrument has a positive role but, first of all, the procedures are too long to provide effective protection for workers who need support quickly so that they are not left to their own devices. Secondly, the brief history of this EGF has already been plagued by very controversial cases of payments from public authorities which served only to repair the damage caused by companies savagely outsourcing. The European Union would do better than to beat its head against a brick wall. It needs, first of all, to think about how it authorises free trade which is both lawless and unscrupulous. When will social and environmental criteria be integrated in our commercial agreements to combat dumping? The famous EGF must be a tool supporting the immediate transition to high quality ‘green’ jobs, hence local jobs that cannot be outsourced. In the specific case of Renault, the EGF does not authorise the cofinancing of passive measures. What is the current situation in the case of Renault? Neither the Renault Group, nor the French Government, nor the European Commission has been able to convince us that the training measures offered to workers at the time were active measures. What does that mean? It means real training programmes aimed at making people employable. That is the first thing. Secondly, I think that the case, in particular, of all the workers threatened with insecurity because they joined the early retirement scheme is not a specifically French issue – as has been said – but a question of European solidarity. All workers must be treated in the same way: some have nothing to gain from measures, while others do. I am pleased to hear my colleague, Mr Gauzès, for whom I have very high regard, tell us today, in this Chamber, that Renault has committed itself to take concrete measures. I am a little sad to hear this only today. I think he should have woken up long ago. Karima Delli,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis should in no way be used as a pretext for neglecting health and safety at work. Our aim is to provide good-quality employment to all workers, despite persistent mass unemployment and a sharp rise in casual work. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at work, 168 000 people die each year in Europe as a result of work-related accidents and illnesses, of which more than half are cancers, and one quarter are cardio-vascular diseases. How can we not be shocked by this growing number? As rapporteur for the review of the European strategy on health and safety at work, which will come to an end in 2012, my conclusions are clear. It would be morally wrong to turn a blind eye to people’s suffering at work. It would also be a mistake in economic terms, because all the studies indicate that accidents and professional illnesses are very costly, both to our health and social security systems and to our businesses. From 2013 onwards, this strategy should be more ambitious, more consistent and, above all, more courageous. To achieve that, we need to strengthen the legislative framework and adapt current legislation to new occupational hazards such as psychosocial risks, musculoskeletal problems and nanomaterials. Work-related stress should not be treated merely with training courses, as this has proven entirely insufficient given that half of all European workers are exposed to risks that affect their mental health. The truth should be spelled out. Workers suffer, in particular, from the sudden reorganisation or intensification of their work and poor methods of management. Furthermore, many employees draw attention to dangers for people as well as the environment. These workers must be protected. I am proud that Parliament is calling on the Commission to establish a directive that protects these much talked about whistle-blowers. The European Commission should not hesitate to bring infringement proceedings against Member States that do not respect their obligations. European harmonisation in the health sphere is a significant step forward. It is also vital to foster a culture of prevention in Europe. The Member States should increase the staff employed in their labour inspection services and seek to achieve the objective of one inspector per 10 000 workers, in accordance with International Labour Organisation recommendations. There is absolutely no justification for weakening the prevention rules in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or for independent workers, who enjoy the same fundamental right to health protection. Furthermore, we have observed an increase in outsourcing of work and the emergence of subcontracting chains. There are new groups of workers who are not covered by prevention policies: casual workers, bogus self-employed people, subcontracted workers, and so on. Given the risk of exposure to powerful radiation and the dangers linked to the management of radioactive waste, it is essential that rigorous standards are applied to training, safety at work and inspection by independent bodies. Finally, we need to take stock of new, emerging hazards, such as chemical and biological risks, which are complex but for which there is still insufficient data. Rapid action needs to be taken on asbestos, silica and other recognised carcinogens. The REACH provisions play a very important part in preventing cancers and other work-related diseases. It needs to be kept up-to-date and comprehensively implemented. Finally, professional illnesses should be recognised, or better recognised, starting with cancers, in order to quickly identify all of the issues. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on all of you to support my report, because I am perfectly sure that it will enable us to meet all these challenges, and that Europe has a role to play. It should protect all workers, who must not lose their lives on account of their job. Commissioner, I hope that, from 2013, there will be a European strategy on health and safety at work, and I truly hope that we will make swift progress on this. Karima Delli,

Madam President, Mr Daerden, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank Mr Daerden for the true spirit of cooperation that has marked the work of the committee. First, a small preliminary point. I would like to remind this House that if we want to combat poverty, there is no use trying the employability approach. In other words, nowadays, work is no longer a true protection against poverty. There are millions of poor people in work. I would like to highlight three particular points which I think are vital if we want to make progress with realistic objectives in the fight against poverty within the EU 2020 strategy. Firstly, the call for a legislative proposal on schemes for a minimum income equal to 60% of the average income in each Member State, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our Parliament one year ago. I think that, as the crisis has worsened, we have become aware that such a measure is essential for our poorest citizens. Secondly, the call for a framework directive targeted at guaranteeing the quality of, and especially accessibility to, all social services of general interest, particularly in health, education, public transport, energy and water. Thirdly, we are re-drafting a call to Member States to adopt at the earliest opportunity the proposal for a wide-ranging, anti-discrimination proposal. I welcome these latter two points which seem to me of utmost importance. We are calling for the implementation of a genuine European strategy to help the homeless. The Commission and the Member States can no longer turn a deaf ear to the issue of poor housing in Europe. A genuine solution must be found to these problems today. I am also delighted that we have reached a final agreement on negotiations over food aid, but we should not forget that we must now start thinking about the period after 2013, or more generally about earmarking substantial sums from the cohesion policy budget for the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Finally, I would like to encourage the participation, thanks to this report, of all civil society in the introduction of the platform, because we can only speak for the poor if we do so with them. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 The adoption of this report calling on the Commission to work towards introducing binding legislation on an adequate minimum income at the poverty threshold level, which is an indispensable tool for achieving the realistic objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020, is a major victory. To fight poverty, it is not enough to make speeches on growth: with 8.4% of workers poor in the EU, employment no longer protects against poverty. I am pleased that the proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to tax high incomes has been approved. It is high time that the Heads of State or Government understood that they are not there to serve the interests of the richest 1%, but to defend the 99%. I am pleased that people living in poverty will play a crucial role in the establishment of this platform. Today, policy must be drawn up ‘with’ and not just ‘for’ the poorest. I regret that our call for a framework directive on the quality and accessibility of social services of general interest was rejected. Universal access to public services is fundamental to the protection of the poorest. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently 80 million people living with a disability in Europe. Almost 70% of them are unemployed and 25% live in poverty. The European Union has a few aces up its sleeve to help these people and ensure greater equality of rights: raising more European funding, conducting widespread awareness campaigns, and compiling pan-European statistics in order to make public policies more effective. Above all, however, it is time to release the draft anti-discrimination directive, which has been blocked for over 10 years by Europe’s Heads of State or Government. I am pleased that my fellow MEPs have rallied behind us to ensure that the following message is heard loud and clear: the next stage in the fight for equal rights is an agreement between the EU Member States on this directive. Backed into a corner, the governments can no longer evade their responsibilities. We also call on the Commission to propose a major EU directive on accessibility for people with disabilities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the wave of redundancies that is affecting workers across Europe must lead us to reflect on the role that we, as political representatives, must play in the face of multinational firms that are acting without any social ethics, proceeding with shareholder-driven redundancies and relocating their operations in order to cut costs, increase their shareholders’ profits and please the rating agencies, with no regard whatsoever for social and environmental standards. In its resolution of 29 September on the future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), Parliament clearly expressed its desire to support, first and foremost, the workers adversely affected by restructuring. We called on the Commission to ensure consistency between EGF interventions and the European Union’s industrial policy, notably through the use of the structural funds. We also called for improvements in the future EGF Regulation to ensure that the fund does not generate moral hazard effects for multinational companies, as demonstrated today by the ArcelorMittal and Nokia cases. Commissioner, we can no longer continue to look separately at the structural funds and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund without taking into account the restructuring strategies of companies that benefit from them and without examining the cost-benefit ratio of a policy – and I shall say it again clearly – that benefits European workers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise. More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme. The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival. The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid. I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested. Parliament spoke some strong words last time, when we said that human beings are more important than finance. It is high time we reasserted that. In any case, Parliament will be extremely vigilant, and we will not hesitate to renew our call in a constructive manner. Karima Delli,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, a debate is being held in this House on the situation of homeless people! I should like to begin by paying tribute to all the associations in the community that work all year round to help the most vulnerable people among us, the homeless. Not having a home to call one’s own is a serious violation of fundamental rights and human dignity. It is the most visible and the saddest link in the chain of poor housing. Above all, it is an unacceptable form of injustice. It is crucial to understand why people end up on the streets, so that proper preventive policies can be put in place. Rather than looking for ways of getting these people off the streets, it is much easier not to plunge them into homelessness in the first place. When are we going to put a stop to tenant eviction? When are we going to stop property speculation? When will we finally realise that rising poverty and insecurity lead to exclusion? The face of homelessness has changed; the image of the bohemian down-and-out belongs in the past. The reality today is much more complex and much harsher. It is increasingly young people, women, families – in particular migrants – and even poor workers who are without a home. There are many types of homelessness. Of course, there are the homeless people that one sees on the floor in the street, in winter, under cardboard boxes, or in tents in public parks, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Millions of people live in emergency hostels, in temporary housing or with friends or family; they may even sleep in cars or in insalubrious hotels. Faced with an emergency situation that is becoming worse by the day, the associations are constantly sounding the alarm. However, governments come and go, and the scandalous failure to address the situation continues. It is high time the Member States faced up to their responsibilities. It is high time we put a stop to this shameful situation. Europe must strive to help the Member States establish fundamental values and long-term solutions to this situation, because our main duty is to protect the weakest among us. In the light of this unacceptable situation, we cannot continue to look the other way, in the same way as people avoid looking at homeless people on the street. What is worse, homeless people are expelled from town centres to the outskirts, far from the stares of businessmen and tourists. However, just because they are out of sight, it does not mean they do not exist! There is no point in hiding the problem; it needs to be resolved today. In one country, which you know well, Commissioner, homeless people are quite simply regarded as criminals. They are forbidden from sleeping on the streets, and are fined if they do, and the police hunt them down as far as underground stations or railway stations, despite the fact that there are no appropriate services in place to accommodate them. The time for communication, false political promises and campaign slogans, as we see in certain States, is now past. That is why, following the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, Parliament is calling on you to implement an integrated strategy aimed at resolving the problem of homelessness by 2020, based on the work that has already been carried out. This strategy should focus on five major objectives: firstly, preventing homelessness; secondly, reducing its duration; thirdly, targeting the most severe types of homelessness; fourthly, improving the quality of services for homeless people; and finally, providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing. This strategy must be coordinated with national and regional strategies. The results achieved with regard to the indicators developed jointly at European level must be regularly reviewed. Emphasis must be placed on social innovation, in particular, measures aimed at making housing the first step on the path towards social reintegration. Lastly, adequate funding must be guaranteed at both European and national level. Commissioner, all talk aside, this is an emergency. Action is needed now. This is a question of political will: people do not have to be made homeless. Let us not wait until winter to remember that people die on the streets all year round. It is possible to put a stop to homelessness, and I think that the European Parliament is showing the way. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1986, a great French actor, the founder of the Restos du coeur
 soup kitchens, said: ‘It is high time that we showed some solidarity.’ Twenty-five years on, what have we achieved? Poverty and inequalities are on the rise. It is high time that you faced up to your responsibilities. In particular, you need to prod into action all those Member States that are failing to help our poorest citizens. It is also high time that we eradicated poverty. How long are we going to wait before adopting a real framework directive on minimum pay that will allow everyone to live in dignity, but above all, will give them enough to eat and guarantee all of their fundamental rights? At a time when we are discussing a European platform against poverty and when we are being told that 43 million Europeans are at risk, you decide to cut the budget. That is a scandalous decision. Let me repeat that: it is scandalous. It is high time that … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty is the most cruel, most inhumane and most degrading penalty, and is a violation of the right to life, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Davinder Pal Singh is in danger of being executed imminently in New Delhi, in India, as the President of India rejected his plea for clemency in May, and it should be noted that this is the second appeal rejected in the course of that month. That is why this resolution sends a strong signal from the European Parliament. The European Parliament must condemn all executions, no matter where they take place. The European Parliament must encourage the European Union and its Member States to ensure that the United Nations resolution calling for a universal moratorium on executions is applied. The aim of this resolution is to achieve complete abolition in all those states that still apply capital punishment. I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed to this resolution. I shall simply mention in closing that I have tabled two amendments, because I would like to remind you that Davinder Pal Singh had already applied for political asylum in Germany, but he was forcibly deported to India, where he was arrested on his arrival in New Delhi in January 1995. Nevertheless, two years later, the Court in Frankfurt declared his expulsion to be illegal. He should therefore never have been deported to India, where his life was under threat. Finally, there is a wide range of evidence to suggest that Davinder Pal Singh did not receive a fair trial. That is the subject of the second amendment to be voted on. I would like to thank my fellow Members, and I hope that the entire resolution and the two amendments will be adopted. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the vote on the report by Mr De Rossa, which reminds us that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are at the heart of the European social model. We would point out that SSGIs are available to everyone and that we should ensure that everyone has access to them, especially with regard to social housing. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to propose legislation recognising universal access to basic banking services and to broadband Internet. Finally, we are asking for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between economic and non-economic services, which would provide greater protection for social services. Unfortunately, while the urgency of the economic and social situation would have required Members to demand a framework legislative tool on SSGIs, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed in its alternative resolution, my fellow Members refused to take that courageous initiative. The horizontal social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantee social rights, especially the right to access services of general interest. The time has come to prove to EU citizens that a social Europe is on its way and to give public services the place they deserve in European law. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, the cross-cutting social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon place a binding obligation on States to protect social rights and the right of access to services of general interest in particular. It is time we proved to Europe’s citizens that social Europe works. We must therefore give our body of social legislation its rightful place in EU law, by acknowledging the specific nature of social services of general interest where competition rules are concerned, bearing in mind that these services are strongly linked to local communities and rely on parties involved in the social economy. Mr De Rossa’s report is an opportunity to affirm principles that are simple and at the same strongly rooted in common sense, equality and universal access to these collectively run services, which contribute to social well-being and progress. Commissioner, you said: ‘The time has come to put ideas into practice.’ The time has come indeed, which is why I propose that in this debate you should provide real support for a European legislative instrument for public social services. I therefore call upon you to vote for the alternative motion for a resolution tabled by our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, cohesion policy must ensure harmonious and above all fair development between all territories. It is for this reason that we support the introduction of a new category of intermediary regions for the allocation of funds, as well as the application of new development indicators and indicators for social justice, well-being and environmental justice. We regret that this does not appear in the Pieper report. For the sake of fairness, cohesion policy must also tackle sub-regional development inequalities to restore meaning to the word ‘cohesion’, that is to say this solidarity which is the added value of the European Union. To achieve this, it must focus on inequalities, especially within urban areas, which are particularly affected by new challenges – social, environmental – and that is a huge task. Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there. It will also promote a new sustainable city, desirable for all, a model that meets the environmental, energetic and socio-demographic challenges, but one which places the living environment and the well-being of its inhabitants at the heart of our concerns. I will end with a clear message: after 2013, cohesion policy must have at its disposal much-needed and stable resources to be able to exist. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I am delighted that this report has been adopted, since most of our ideas (climate, social cohesion, integrated and bottom-up approach, disadvantaged neighbourhoods, cross-funding and so on) are included. However, I do regret that with regard to implementing the urban dimension, there is not a clearer signal in favour of a more widespread use of general subsidies for direct management by towns. Furthermore, this report should have elaborated on opening up deprived neighbourhoods, the role of medium-sized towns in the urban agenda, as well as the battle for climate and social mixing in our towns.

I welcome the ideas that have been taken forward, through the adoption of this report, to enhance synergies between policies with an impact on territories, on the one hand, and between funds, on the other hand, in particular by increasing financing and setting up multiregional programmes. I find it deplorable, however, that the involvement of local and regional powers in the decision-making process is not being viewed as a priority. Improving governance through the additional involvement of authorities with decentralised management capacities is the way to respond to the need for absorption, efficiency and simplification, all of which are desirable when implementing cohesion policy.

 By adopting this report, I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved, since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as ‘intermediate’ for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions.

 Mr President, first of all, I shall deal with the cultural and creative industries. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent. In this report, particular attention is paid to the working conditions in the sector, in particular, irregular income and insecure working relations, which call for an in-depth debate in order to take account of specific aspects, for instance, by fighting against discrimination in terms of remuneration, and to improve the match between job held and level of qualification. We want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content, and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards. Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes. I now turn to the ‘Youth on the Move’ scheme. Things are tough for young Europeans: whether accessing employment, education, accommodation, social services, they undergo what is tantamount to the ordeals of a social initiation ceremony. We need to restore their confidence in the future by providing adapted and ambitious answers. I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training. In this respect, I should like to stress the request, which I support, put to the European Commission, for a Green Paper on youth participation. Our report also highlights the idea of mobility, which should be accessible to all, and I welcome that. Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training. It would be regrettable to categorise young Europeans as either an educated elite, multilingual and confident in the future, or as young people left behind on the grounds that they do not have a Masters degree or because they are only doing manual work. I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme. I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people’s autonomy. Our report insists on the main desire of young people to be autonomous, to have access to healthcare in particular, and to have decent accommodation at a reasonable price. We all know that the young person who has no option but to work as well as study is heading towards failure in his/her studies. Finally, I am delighted that, in this House, it has been recognised that work placements should no longer be jobs in disguise, fully-fledged jobs. Work placements must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection. (Applause) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work. These women contribute to our economy, yet they suffer very poor working conditions and violations of their most basic rights. The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a ‘Convention on decent work for domestic workers’. This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards. The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as they have to commit to ratify this convention. At European level, we will also need to stop considering separately and systematically the immigration and labour policies. It is not right for domestic workers to be coerced into informal work, regardless of their rights, because of an immigration regulation that is too strict and ill-adapted. Karima Delli,

 Mr President, the United Nations report, published on 11 April, throws light on the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed in Sri Lanka in the conflict between the government forces of Mr Rajapaksa and the Tamil Tiger independence movement. The clashes in May and June 2009 gave rise to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and thousands of civilians lost their lives. We cannot accept the impunity of those responsible and of the authors of these crimes. The government of Mr Rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the UN report and it even contests its conclusions. In Sri Lanka, the press is muzzled, and journalists are subject to intimidation and arbitrary detention. The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations. The Tamil minority is the victim of a genocide that dare not speak its name. We must urgently send European Parliament observers to the north of Sri Lanka to see what is really happening there and reassert the principle of the self-determination of peoples.

 The European Parliament adopted a report, this Tuesday 5 April 2011, on fighting violence against women. This text emphasises the specific nature of violence against women and girls by men: it is indeed one of the most common and harmful obstacles to gender equality. Today’s report will make it possible to implement a criminal-law instrument in the form of a European Union directive to combat gender-based violence. Indeed, it establishes a European charter, which will ensure a minimum level of assistance, including the right to free legal aid and urgent psychological aid services. Furthermore, MEPs are calling on the Commission to establish a European observatory on violence against women. Thanks to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, an adopted amendment also calls for Member States to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship, as a crime.

 The European Parliament has voted in favour of the principle of creating a single work and residence permit for third-country nationals in a Member State. This procedure provides a set of common rights for these workers, particularly with regard to working conditions, such as working time and holidays. The text also sets out the principle of reimbursing pension contributions already made by workers who leave the EU, since they will be unable to receive their pensions after they retire. This text is problematic, however, since it reinforces the ‘country of origin’ principle for some categories of workers, a principle that was fought by the European left during the time of the famous ‘Bolkestein’ Directive. This principle creates a kind of two-speed labour market depending on the worker’s origin, and contributes to a form of social dumping. There is a contradiction here: do we really want to protect the European social model, and should it exclude non-European workers, or should it take a universalist approach and stop discriminating against workers by giving them different rights? This text does not yet resolve this fundamental issue, which is why I decided to abstain from voting on the text. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Parliament has adopted a good text. It emphasises Europe’s important role in ensuring the social inclusion of the Roma within the European Union, with the application of this strategy at local level. The report points out that a strategy for the Roma is possible only with the cooperation of members of the community – in short, we must work ‘with’ before we work ‘for’. The Roma should therefore be involved in any decision making. The text points out the difficult living conditions, discrimination and difficulties in accessing essential services that the Roma suffer. It points out the need to ensure respect for the freedom of movement of European citizens. It also mentions the importance, in social inclusion terms, of social protection, vocational training, education and public service provision. It denounces the insufficient allocation of funds, when the money could be put to good use. However, the real drawback of this report is the insistence by the conservatives in the European Parliament on mentioning the need to combat the Roma people’s so-called ‘prolonged dependence’ on the social welfare system. This is a scandalous prejudice aimed once again at marginalising the Roma community. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 This text does not stand out for its quality, since it is the result of a very broad compromise between the MEPs. It contains both elements that are very positive in the eyes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and certain ideas that we have sought in vain to denounce. However, the main thing is that it enables MEPs to express a rather progressive opinion on the EU 2020 strategy’s flagship programme dedicated to industry. Hence, the text calls for transport systems to be made more sustainable through the use of more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions. It points out the need to place energy and resource savings at the heart of European industrial policy. In this respect, it recalls the huge job potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield. The adoption of measures that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors. MEPs also sought to encourage all the efforts made to redress skills shortages in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry.

 I welcome the vote on this report on equality between men and women. In terms of remuneration, for example, and despite continued legislative efforts on the subject at European level, women still earn 18% less on average than men for the same work in the European Union. I would also like to emphasise that we had to battle for a long time within this Parliament merely to ensure that such a basic right as access to contraception could be mentioned. This kind of rearguard debate does little for the reputation of the European right. Luckily, the final report is a good one. It sets the objective of reducing the pay gap to less than 5% by 2020 and, in particular, calls on the Member States to do all they can to enforce the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’, with sanctions for non-compliant States. It calls for binding objectives to ensure equality in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some emotion and on behalf of my fellow Members, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Lynne, Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Protasiewicz, that I would like to express my sincere thanks for your support of Written Declaration 61/2010 on an EU homelessness strategy. While today, the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative – a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion – this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States. The time for talking is over. It is now time to act. Specific proposals can now be implemented. Let us make sure that we have put an end to rough sleeping by 2015. I wish you all a happy holiday and I believe we will get off to a good start next year. (Applause) Karima Delli,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 million people living in poverty in Europe, over 5 million homeless, millions poorly housed, one in five children victims of poverty, and, at the other end of the scale, what do we have? The number of billionaires is increasing. We have just held the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October and the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will soon draw to a close, but what will we have to show for this? What concrete solutions will Europe have offered to those who are the primary victims of a crisis for which they are not responsible? What hope can we offer my generation, this European generation bearing the brunt of unemployment, insecurity and exclusion, these young people who are mistrustful of Europe, who expect a lot from Europe and therefore from you? We are duty bound to answer their day-to-day concerns and their anxieties over the future. The Lisbon strategy has failed in its mission to eradicate poverty. We can no longer stand by idly and let things happen. Now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetoric. The time has come to be bold and show some political courage. All the organisations working with victims of poverty, ATD Fourth World, the European Anti-poverty Network (EAPN), the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), Emmaüs Europe, have been demanding this for 20 years! That is why we are asking the European Commission for a framework directive which aims to set an adequate minimum income. This framework directive will ensure eligibility for and access to an adequate minimum income so that any child, adult or elderly person living in poverty can break free from it, thus guaranteeing them their inalienable right to live in dignity. Time is running out, ladies and gentlemen, the need for action has never been more urgent. Together, we can put an end to the outrageous scandal that is long-term poverty. Poverty, end poverty, this should not be just a slogan. It is a reality and together, I hope, we will take on this battle. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Courard, Commissioner, the principal objective of the European Union, an objective which appears in the Treaty of Lisbon, is the development of a social market economy oriented towards full employment and social progress. It therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment, adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all EU policies. The recognition of social rights and, in particular, of the right to access services of general interest, is made binding in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter contains rights and principles, such as the right to access social security payments, housing benefits and social services. On the eve of the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, initiated by Parliament, how can you claim that, in applying the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, only the rules on competition and the internal market need apply to these social services of general interest, with no adaptation to their specific modes of organisation and financing? Is it not true that the Services Directive, for example, calls into question the role of social services of general interest with a strong local base consisting of community members who are not aiming for financial gain? When will you stop burying your head in the sand and when will you finally shoulder your responsibility as colegislator, in accordance with the provisions of the new Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the positive progress that this directive represents in the face of the urgent need to combat climate change. 2010 is the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The European Partnership for Energy and the Environment (EPEE) estimates that between 50 and 125 million Europeans suffer from energy poverty. However, this new legislation concerns only new buildings and will affect only 2.7 million new homes per year, when there are 200 million old homes in the European Union. The fact is, at least 150 million homes will have to be renovated by 2050 in order to attain factor 4. Commissioner, since 2007, 4% of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has been set aside to improve the energy performance of buildings, but has been used only to a very limited extent. How, then, are you going to put pressure on the Member States to really use these funds, because if they go unused, they are liable to disappear from 2013, when some of them will actually have to be increased? Karima Delli,

Mr President, 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and it is in this context that we shall adopt, I hope, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij, which represents a major advance in the improvement of the living conditions of disadvantaged populations, insofar as it makes eligible for European aid, via the ERDF, projects for renovating and building housing and for combating energy poverty in all the Member States. This proposal, which is supported by the Council of Europe, has long been awaited by all those who campaign for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities, and particularly of the Roma. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the fact that the Union is investing heavily in the improvement of housing for the most disadvantaged communities, but we must not stop now that we are doing so well. We will be very vigilant with regard to the actual use of these funds, since they must not result in the exclusion of marginalised communities. Indeed, there are numerous examples of urban renovation projects. They include the restoration of the city centre of Barcelona, and the work to regenerate the historic centres in the new Member States, which have done particularly well out of real estate speculation through the explosion in rent and rental charges. This, in turn, has led to the most disadvantaged families being driven away from the city centres. These people absolutely must receive genuine social support and access to all public services, such as education, health care and public transport, but – as we proposed during the examination in committee – they must also receive resources sufficient to enable them to remain in these neighbourhoods, so that the latter do not become gentrified. Parliament will have to evaluate the projects carried out before these funds are renewed in 2013 and will have to be involved in drafting the future regulation laying down the eligibility criteria, particularly in relation to transparency, so as to ensure that every single vulnerable population actually receives these funds and is afforded a dignified existence in the long term.

Madam President, President Václav Havel’s speech to our House highlighted one of the fundamental principles of the European Union: solidarity among human beings. We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that wall of shame. Following 9 November 1989, we were told that humanity would finally be set free. Democracy and human rights were supposed to extend to the entire planet, knocking down walls, removing barriers between peoples. However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent? The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive. Let us knock down the walls of fortress Europe, let us build bridges, not walls … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the Sri Lankan Government has maintained a wall of silence regarding the situation of the Tamil civilian population, preventing foreign media and humanitarian organisations from gaining access to them. Since March 2009, Colombo has been holding almost all of the civilians who fled the fighting between the army and the Tamil Tigers, in complete violation of international law and human rights. In July, the Sri Lankan Government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north-east of the island. The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases. In some camps, more than 1 000 people are dying every week, mainly of dysentery. The living conditions are appalling. President Rajapaksa declared last week that only 100 000 Tamil refugees would be released. In view of the scale of the tragedy, the European Union must step up the pressure on the Sri Lankan Government in order to obtain the immediate and unconditional release of all the civilians, access to the camps for journalists and the prompt delivery of humanitarian aid.

Mr President, my speech concerns the deterioration in working conditions in Europe. Today, nearly half of the people working in the world earn less than USD 2 a day. 12.3 million people are still victims of slavery, and more than 200 million children are forced to work. In Europe, the number of working poor is increasing day by day, and each year the International Labour Organisation records 160 000 deaths linked to a lack of prevention. In this context, I would like to emphasise our responsibility towards all those who are deprived of jobs and social rights, who work in unfit conditions, towards those millions of workers who suffer mentally and physically, who are, at times, driven to suicide, or who are victims of cancers or chronic diseases caused by their working conditions. It is time to break with the religion that dictates that we must work harder, and to stop the race to make profits and to compete in the short term. Guaranteeing the right to decent work and strengthening labour law must be the Union’s top priority over the next 10 years. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleagues have said, the image of the European Union that Erasmus gives is a good one. Endangering this standard-bearer for the European Union, which has done so much to create a positive image and which meets the needs of young people at a time when many of our fellow citizens are having doubts about the European project, is tragic. The Council representatives present have underlined the many problems there are in 2012 and also concerning the future funding of Erasmus, but have not given any firm answers. The question being put to the Member States today, on which there is a consensus in Parliament, is this: are you going to increase your contributions to its funding to meet the commitments you have made? Quite apart from Erasmus, the issue of funding for education programmes and also for the Cohesion Fund is equally tragic. Personally, I am a supporter of independent financing of the EU budget, which would liberate us from the Member States’ erratic decision-making. Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ever since President Mubarak’s fall in February 2011, Egypt has been run by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which gave itself the powers to legislate and to draft the Constitution. How can we not be worried? It was against this backdrop that Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, was elected on 24 June. For many Egyptian women, Mohamed Morsi's election jeopardises women’s rights. It should be pointed out that Islamist MPs had previously proposed reforming a provision that allows women to divorce without their husband’s consent. Similarly, they tried to pass a law banning women from seeking a divorce. Women must be listened to and their demands heard. Without them, democracy in Egypt will not be possible. They call for the provisions of the Charter on Women's Rights to be implemented in Egypt, a charter established last year by more than a thousand women and approved by half a million Egyptian citizens, men and women alike. This document sanctions fundamental rights such as the right to participate in political and economic life, representation in government and equality before the law. The Egyptian legal system must protect women against all forms of violence. We absolutely must support these demands, demands which are legitimate. Will Baroness Ashton support them? What steps will she consider to support Egypt on the road to democracy? How can we, as Europeans, respond to the concerns of these young people and women who fear that the arrival of the Islamists … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to add a few words to what Mr Alfonsi has said, and to applaud his work. Macro-regional strategies offer very interesting prospects for decentralised collaborative projects in the Mediterranean region. I think they provide an appropriate framework for the problems of this region, where, in the light of last year’s events, we must develop active neighbourhood policies, aimed at young people in particular. I would like to stress three particular points from my opinion. The first is cooperation in the field of youth, by promoting the European programmes designed for them, and through synergies with the work of the Mediterranean Office for Youth, which needs to be more publicised. The second is the creation of networks between Euro-Mediterranean universities and the removal of obstacles to the movement of students, lecturers and researchers, by simplifying visa procedures for these groups in particular. This is essential and urgent. The third is the quality of teaching and research in these networks, to be achieved by supporting and adequately funding the Tempus and Erasmus Mundus programmes and, I must stress, by automatically granting visas to these groups when they join the European programmes. Thank you to Mr Alfonsi for his productive collaboration, and thank you to all the Members who contributed to this report. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of Volunteering 2011 served to put volunteering under the spotlight and to give the voluntary sector an opportunity to put forward valuable recommendations. I congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission for their contributions on this issue. Mr Scurria’s report highlights the importance of ensuring that all citizens have access to volunteering activities and have the right to make their own contribution in order to support altruism and solidarity in their local area. Volunteering and community work as a whole represent an antidote to the changes in the labour market and to the risk of excluding parts of the population from enjoying basic goods and services. For our group, volunteering must not be a new way of getting people into insecure employment. It is about clearly differentiating between the value of volunteering, provided free of charge, and profit-making activities. Furthermore, we encourage Member States to recognise the rights of volunteers and to use the European Charter on the Rights and Responsibilities of Volunteers as a point of reference.

This report supports the Commission’s policy of taking a liberal approach. Deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) entail the dismantling of tariff barriers and opening of markets and may weaken these emerging economies. Social, environmental, educational and cultural issues are not addressed sufficiently, contrary to the aspirations of the people. Furthermore, DCFTAs are the result of a long process with strict criteria, particularly the obligation to align with European internal market regulations. In addition, these numerous requirements are not related to the prospect of integration into the European Union, as may have been the case for the countries of Eastern Europe. Do we need reminding of the EU’s failure in relation to the Mediterranean? These agreements focus on bilateral relations, failing to provide support for the regional integration of these countries. Instead, such agreements pit these countries against each other for the honour of being ‘champions’ who meet their criteria. At a time when Europeans are considering the possibility of European protectionism, we are demanding the opposite from our Southern partners. Is that really consistent? Is it fair? I do not believe so and that is why I am voting against this report, despite the fact that it does have some positive aspects. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, we cannot remain indifferent to or silent about the tragic situation suffered by the Syrian people as they face Bashar al-Assad’s bloody regime. We cannot abandon the Syrian people. First, let us firmly state our support for, and solidarity with, the Syrian people who are suffering. What strategy shall we build? What can we do? First, condemn the veto exercised at the UN by the Chinese and Russian governments and demand that NGOs and journalists be allowed to operate on Syrian territory. Next, support the people by supplying the medicines and medical equipment that they are lacking, bearing in mind that even rural hospitals are being attacked. Medicine cannot be used as a weapon. It is also important to contribute to the setting up of a humanitarian corridor. Finally, we must recognise and support the Syrian opposition around the Syrian National Council so that they can rebuild a state that matches the aspirations of the Syrian people. Furthermore, we must send Assad and those responsible for crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to two points regarding two of our partners on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. The first point is the concern of many Algerians regarding current reforms and, in particular, the law on associations to be voted on in the Algerian Parliament. Algerian civil society is concerned that this law could stifle society as a result of two new things that it introduces. Firstly, all associations will have to apply for a licence in order to exist. Secondly, foreign funding, including European, will no longer be allowed. The second point is that in Tunisia, at a time when the rule of law is being established and a new constitution negotiated, independent judges want our support so that they have the means to work towards establishing an independent judiciary and the training of Tunisian judges in transitional justice. Commissioner, will you respond to these concerns and these demands? Malika Benarab-Attou

 Mr President, at a time when Tunisia has just held its first democratic elections, the Member States of the European Union are still struggling to support the aspirations of those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and to demonstrate real solidarity. The Council’s reactions to the revolutions in the countries on the southern shore can no longer be limited to declarations of principle and short-term objectives. The European Union must move up a gear by proposing concrete, long-term measures. This is the purpose of this resettlement programme. The conclusion – at last – of the ordinary legislative procedure on this issue and, by extension, the application by all the Member States of the common European programme on the resettlement of refugees, at a historic moment in time, would bear witness to our will to react effectively by working together to propose suitable instruments. Currently, only 10 Member States participate annually in the resettlement of refugees, and there is no proper coordination when they do. Yet the representatives of the EU Member States have said again in recent months that they support the peoples’ aspirations. This support for the people of partner countries must result in Europe showing solidarity by accommodating refugees. The European resettlement programme should be an additional tool for protecting refugees and asylum seekers. It should allow for the implementation of a European hospitality policy for resettled populations. It needs to be implemented urgently. We must break the deadlock before the end of 2011, and it is up to the Council to do this. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Bastos, for her work and fruitful working relationship with the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, of which I am one. We agree with the Commission’s observation as regards the need to raise the qualification levels of young Europeans as well as the need to redefine certain skills that students might need today. We must not limit our proposals to satisfying the needs of labour market areas; we must also guarantee fair and universal access to quality public education and lifelong learning, so as to promote the intellectual and social development of every citizen, and particularly of young people, given the unacceptably high rate of unemployment among that age group. In order to achieve this, I believe there are two crucial aspects: firstly, digital literacy, which is becoming increasingly important for our evolving knowledge-based society. Emphasis must be placed, first and foremost, on literacy-based initiatives, and on refreshing and updating key skills in the field of communication and information technology, so as to reduce, or indeed eliminate, the digital divide. The next step for the Member States, therefore, is to integrate digital culture into teaching and training systems, while teaching a critical approach to modern forms of communication and media content. Secondly, and more generally, education and training have a place in the Green New Deal that we environmentalists wish to implement in the European Union. Indeed, we need to start by speeding up the transition towards a sustainable economy and developing the huge potential for green jobs that exists throughout Europe, with a view to protecting and restoring environmental quality and the quality of life of our fellow citizens across a wide range of sectors, such as transport, energy supply and even public services … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, how much longer are we going to ask Tunisians indirectly to bear the dramatic consequences of our poor management of aid to the refugees? The solidarity shown by Tunisian society is crumbling. We can no longer remain indifferent to the health situation and the new outbreaks of diseases in the camps. It has to be recognised that we, the European Union, have failed on several points: an inhumane migration policy; shameful humanitarian aid measures to tackle the huge needs on the ground; a lack of European solidarity, calling into question the very foundations of Europe. How do we, as European defenders of human rights, see ourselves? What support is the European Union talking about when it addresses people who have, today, effected their democratic revolution? We have the resources to help these refugees but, if there is no political will or tangible force, the Mediterranean will remain a cemetery. Is this acceptable? Can we continue in this way? We must reconsider the issue of the refugees and migration on the basis of a human rights approach taking into account the new political situations. The security approach and the ‘dusting’ carried out by the Frontex Agency are no match for our high standards and values. In the short, medium and long term, the financial assistance given by the European Union must be directed at strengthening the capacities of civil society in Tunisia, in particular, and in the countries of the south more generally. I should like to conclude by stressing that the immigrants of today are resources and not a burden. Am I not an example? Yesterday an immigrant, today a Member of the European Parliament.

 Madam President, the peoples of the southern Mediterranean expect a strong gesture of solidarity and support from us amid the upheaval and the challenges they face. These are peoples whom we colonised in the recent past, which means that we have an added responsibility. In supporting their democratic transition, we must devise, here in Europe, a true policy of hospitality that is consistent with our value of fraternity. Devising a policy of hospitality means, first of all, reviewing the reception conditions at our borders and ensuring that the fundamental rights of those who cross them are respected. It also means finding a solution for the thousands of young people who are dying in the Mediterranean, before our very eyes. This is unacceptable. This report, despite including new clauses on respect for human rights and fundamental rights in Frontex’s mandate, is not aimed at a new policy of hospitality. Despite the proposed changes, Frontex’s mandate is still confined to a repressive ‘fortress Europe’ attitude. We must continue our efforts to guarantee more thorough assessments of Frontex operations, with the help of an independent monitoring body, so as to ensure respect for democracy and fundamental rights set out in our report.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the demands for democracy, freedom and dignity of the peoples of the southern Mediterranean call for action from us here in Europe, their northern Mediterranean neighbours. We have taken too long to respond – or, in some cases, not to respond – to these long-standing needs, in keeping with the values that we preach. First Algeria, then Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Morocco, Jordan: the people of the southern Mediterranean are reminding us of a longing to be able to live according to the universal values of equality, freedom and brotherhood. The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) might be the project on which our new relationship could be based, around common values of solidarity and respect for the law. However, the UfM has come up against Israel’s policies, as it continues to flout international law and to colonise Palestinian territory. The UfM summit has been cancelled twice because of this. It is time we put our words into action and stopped applying double standards. Baroness Ashton, will you dare to take action that will allow the Palestinian state to exist within its 1967 borders and lift the blockade on Gaza? The time has come to do this if we do not want to lose credibility in the eyes of our southern neighbours. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the G8 countries decided to grant the sum of USD 40 billion to Tunisia and Egypt, as has already been said. However, the European Union must present the case for greater transparency, visibility and traceability; in short, better governance of this aid. We need to focus on four key points: first, ensuring that development cooperation is in keeping with the principles of democracy and absolute transparency; second, guaranteeing respect for human rights; strengthening the role and capacities of civil society organisations and reforming the system of governance that applies to aid, with stronger involvement by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, the EU must be able to guarantee that this aid reaches the people it is intended for. What concrete measures is the EU planning in this respect? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports by Mrs Schaake and Mrs Sanchez-Schmid remind us that culture is not a decoration motif but the fruit of complex interdependencies, showing that cultural questions should be addressed in a transverse manner and integrated into all European policies, internal as well as external, social as well as economic. In this respect, I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees, with the European Commission’s other services, as well as with Baroness Ashton’s European External Action Service. Furthermore, I would like to come back to a point that has not been expanded on in these reports, concerning the mobility of artists and of professionals in the cultural sector. Indeed, this issue is of major importance for the emergence of a European cultural area. In this regard, two aspects seem to me to be important; namely, firstly, the dissemination by the European Union and Member States of clear and understandable information on regulations and procedures currently in force. Secondly, the removal – as has already been said – of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union. I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas. Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries. Therefore, Europe should reposition itself and not abandon the battle over soft power, since what is at stake here today is respect for cultural diversity as a tool for dialogue and as a guarantee of peace and stability worldwide.

However, you forgot to mention one group, to which I myself belong. In Europe, people like me –immigrants and the children of immigrants – who come from the area that was once colonised by Europe, are still stigmatised.

 Madam President, this report is sensitive, and I must criticise its title. The use of the words ‘migration flows’ sets the tone: it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or invaders. These are historic times for the peoples of the Southern Mediterranean and us, but the fear of mass immigration is preventing the EU and the Member States from creating a new dynamic. The recent democratic movements in the South have helped make us aware of our contradictions. They have demonstrated once again the inconsistency and lack of vision of our obsolete and out-of-touch cooperation policies. It is high time the European Union implemented a migration policy that is consistent with our values, that recognises that we live in a world in which people are mobile, a world in which human beings move around. To continue to talk about migration flows is absurd and goes against our humanist values. If we Europeans want to be major players in the world, then we have to change our approach and work towards creating a solidarity-based Union for the Mediterranean; we cannot do so without revising mobility policy, or what is today referred to as migration policy. We must meet the expectations of the peoples of the South. The fear of immigration must no longer guide our policies. Strengthening border controls must no longer be our main motivation in implementing cooperation agreements, as it was in the case of Libya. We must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements, so that we respect human rights. Our actions are still characterised by a security-driven approach to mobility, which goes against our values and the requirement we have to protect populations. The scandalous position adopted by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Guéant must be vigorously denounced. Commissioner, what kind of policy must we adopt in order to establish a true Union for the Mediterranean, one in which we show solidarity with the peoples of the South, who today feel scorned by us?

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, having mistakenly supported dictatorial regimes along the southern coast of the Mediterranean, supposedly as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism, we now need to rise to the challenge presented by these historic events. Europe needs to revise its current policy on authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. President Mubarak must step down now. It behoves us to support the democracies and democratic processes chosen by the people of these countries, not simply to impose our own vision. Let us listen to their voices, let us exercise humility, let us not confuse secularism and security. Change is already happening in these countries. Our financial instruments need to be adapted in order to provide reliable support for the champions of democracy … (The President cut off the speaker

Our fellow citizens must be better informed about country of origin marking and must be able to make purchases in full knowledge of the facts. Europeans still do not know, in fact, whether they are buying goods that have genuinely been produced in Israel or which have come from Israeli colonies in Palestinian territories. The standardisation of origin marking practices in the Union, particularly for agricultural products that come from Israel and the Palestinian territories, is directed to this end.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), two out of thirteen cross-border cooperation programmes are dedicated to the Mediterranean Basin. The first is the cooperation programme for the Mediterranean Basin. With the new generation of European funds for 2007-2013, the European Union has decided to resolutely develop cooperation actions between the north and south shores of the Mediterranean. To this end, the European Union has established the Mediterranean Sea Basin ENPI programme. What territories exactly does this programme apply to? What projects could be co-financed, given that we know that the cooperation programme finances 80% of the total cost of the cooperation programmes in which partner programmes representing at least three eligible countries in a very wide range of fields participate? The second part of the ENPI cross-border programme for Italy and Tunisia has a total allocation for 2007-2013 of EUR 25 191 million. The eligible regions are in Italy and Tunisia. The management authority is the region of Sicily, with Palermo. The objective of the cross-border cooperation programme for Italy and Tunisia is to encourage economic, institutional and cultural integration of the Tunisian and Sicilian regions through a process of joint sustainable development in the context of cross-border cooperation. The programme has three priorities. The first is regional development and regional integration. The second is to encourage sustainable development, through the management of agricultural and fisheries resources, to protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage and to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. My question is as follows: what measures have been put in place to monitor the trade in coral, a fisheries resource that is endangered and the subject of illegal trafficking? The third priority is cultural and scientific cooperation, and support for networks, by strengthening cooperation at association level, training and exchanges between young people and students. My question is as follows: how, beyond the objective of funding, do we ensure that this programme of human exchanges takes place given the obstacles associated with the implementation of the Return Directive by European countries and the management of Schengen visas?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Alps are one of the most heavily built-up mountain regions in Europe. They contain the most important water resources, but their current economic situation makes them vulnerable to global warming. The Alps could play a fundamental role by becoming carbon-neutral by 2050, as defined by the four Environment Ministers of the German-speaking Alpine countries in June this year. They could become the region of choice for creating renewable energy and contributing to achieving the 20% target for 2020. (The speaker broke off) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive drying-up of the Jordan River is a direct consequence of the tragedy that Palestine is experiencing. Water is a highly political issue. Let us not forget that. Let us remember some facts: the World Bank informs us that, for two years, the one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been without chlorine, which is essential for disinfecting the water; 50% of homes did not have access to water before the bombings of January 2009, so imagine what it is like now. Médecins sans Frontières
 say that, now, following the attacks by the Israeli army on the infrastructure, 90% of the water supplied to the inhabitants is unfit for human consumption. Every day, 80 million litres of untreatable sewage is discharged into our Mediterranean as a result of the destruction inflicted on the infrastructure in Gaza. It is true that Baroness Ashton has visited Gaza on several occasions, but where is the political courage to apply to Israel the same standards as we have in Europe? Must clean water, like the land, be monopolised by the Israeli settlers? Consequently, the European Union must suspend the association agreement with the current Israeli Government, which remains deaf to all our requests, whilst the occupation and the settlements, which are illegal, remain. Without justice, there will be no peace. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the situation imposed on the Roma – their expulsion and the denial of their right to free movement in Europe – is unacceptable and goes against European values. However, this situation is but the symptom of a more serious and more general problem. It is merely the reflection of a disease in our so-called modern societies, where we are losing sight of what binds us together as human beings. No, human beings are not commodities that can be stocked and destocked. The policy that we, as the European Union, follow on issues relating to the movement of persons within the Union and to entry and exit from third countries is unacceptable. We cannot pursue this policy of a besieged and timid Europe. The free movement of persons is fundamental. It has always been so, and it is the foundation on which our present-day societies are built. Today, equality is no longer guaranteed where the movement of European and non-European citizens is concerned. While European tourists and pensioners travel freely and in huge numbers to the South, especially to the Maghreb, the citizens of those same countries are unable to move around. The Schengen visas and their application by the EU Member States are inhuman. The considerable barriers to movement prevent citizens of the South from coming to the countries of the North as tourists, friends or family members. President Barroso, what action – bold, concrete action – are you going to take to enable us to adhere to our values once again on this issue? Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean has never been as vital to our future as it is today. Together we have tried, in the report on the UfM, to support a different vision of our Mediterranean. More than just a simple free trade zone, it is a Union founded on the common civilisation of people who share fundamental values. I should like to talk about the most serious obstacle to our Mediterranean ambitions; the violence suffered by the Palestinian people, who are being occupied, expelled and killed by Israel, while Europe fails to assume its historic responsibility in this conflict and really act for peace by recognising the State of Palestine in accordance with the international laws on which our democracies are founded. This coming week, an official Parliament delegation will visit the Gaza Strip in a bid to understand why aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro which Europeans are sending Palestinians is not arriving in the schools and hospitals in Gaza, which I visited in January. I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided, without informing either his members – of whom I am one – or the co-chairs of this delegation, not to visit Gaza with Parliament’s delegation on the instructions of the Israeli Embassy. By boycotting Parliament’s delegation to Gaza, our committee chair is discrediting the whole of Parliament, which passed a resolution on the Goldstone report condemning the fact that contacts with the populations in Gaza were being blocked by the Israeli army and demanding that the block be lifted immediately. We need to remember this resolution and Parliament’s position. This being so, I call for Mr Albertini to resign as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, for failing to meet the demands of his office. What is the point of financing and supervising elections, if we then refuse to recognise those who have chosen the ballot box over arms? Finally, another obstacle to a really fraternal Union for the Mediterranean is the victims who drown on their way from the south side, partly due to the fact that European borders are completely closed to them. Our current migration policy is no longer acceptable. We need to be able, as the UNDP recommends, to ensure that the mobility of citizens from the South is equal to our own mobility to the South. We must be faithful to our project and to our values. Our children will thank us for it and we will be the proud representatives of our peoples. Malika Benarab-Attou,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the value of this report in opening up the debate, within our Parliament, on the position and role of universities in Europe. These universities must, in fact, be encouraged to participate in European integration from the inside rather than to contemplate it from the outside. Over the course of European history, universities have always been places where meetings are held, knowledge is exchanged, thought is developed and training is delivered in the various disciplines. Today, the effects of the crisis and of unemployment must not result in universities restricting their role as providers of professionals who are immediately ready to work because, in our changing societies, the ability to change jobs is becoming vital. On the contrary, universities, as places of higher education and training, must also enable learners to become critical, analytical thinkers, because this will enable them to understand the world in which we live and to use their professional skills wisely. European universities must create the conditions for lifelong learning, contribute to the enrichment of intellectual life and play a central role in the knowledge-based society of today’s digital age.

Mr President, President of the European Investment Bank, in the EIB’s 2008 report, Parliament insisted that the bank’s external activities comply with the general objectives of the European Union. That is why the project to finance a nuclear power station in Jordan would go against the foundations of Article 3(5) of the Treaty on European Union. I quote, ‘In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the sustainable development of the Earth’. In February 2009, the Jordanian authorities contacted the EIB seeking support for their nuclear energy development project, which involves, in particular, the construction of a nuclear power station by 2016. It is therefore with some satisfaction that I have received the assurance of your services that the European Investment Bank did not grant this request and that it considers that its job is to support projects in Jordan aimed at developing wind and solar power, which are energies of the future for our planet because they are renewable. Will this position be pursued for other requests to finance nuclear power stations? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europeana project is taking on a new, ambitious dimension. With this EU digital library, the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible. It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project. A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. One of our continent’s horizons is Africa, but we have blackened that horizon with slavery and colonialism. We have a duty of recognition and reparation towards its peoples. Financial compensation could not meet this need alone, but thanks to the Europeana project, we can help to return to the African peoples part of their culture in terms of its oral literature. Amadou Hampâté Bâ, a Malian intellectual, said: ‘In Africa, when an old person dies, it is a library that burns’. Working to digitise works of oral literature, which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists, and encouraging free access to them through the Europeana project, thereby making them universal in scale, would be a way of protecting and giving life to humanity’s cultural diversity, to which we are all attached.

 Mr President, I am wondering what actions the European Union will introduce to ensure that all Member States observe the right of asylum and respect the human rights of people arriving from the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Many of them are arriving in flimsy craft, and several thousand Africans are drowning without anyone protesting. Are the Council and the Commission really sensitive to these issues, which fall under the headings of both human rights and humanitarian aid? Mr Moratinos’s statements with regard to the strengthening of the security approach and the additional resources allocated to Frontex, decided recently by the Council, do not reassure me in this regard. Ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to act to bring our actions into line with our values. This is urgent, because there are lives at risk. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, on 14 January, I met with members of the Tunisian delegation. We had a frank exchange and debated our respective views. As a Franco-Algerian, I am committed to the Maghreb and I campaign for a united, pluralist and democratic Maghreb. The issue of human rights is crucially important to me, and it is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. The debate on this issue, as it appears in Tunisia, is crucial and relevant. Yesterday morning, I met Mr Ben Brik’s wife, who is leading a hunger strike, as well as activists from the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, and I am concerned. It seems that Mr Ben Brik’s life is in danger due to his illness and his detention conditions. I am sure you realise that if this concern should become a reality, the responsibility will fall very heavily on the shoulders of the Tunisian authorities. Aside from trade relations, we must also take account of social issues. The phenomenon of young Tunisians throwing themselves into the Mediterranean is the product of a closed society that offers no prospects to its young people. The defence against fundamentalism and economic imperatives must not serve as pretexts for ignoring human rights. Real progress in the field of human rights is now crucial. We are not talking here about sanctimonious dogmatism but about an urgent situation that the European Union must help to resolve. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr Barroso, I would like to inform you that, in a few days’ time, we will be observing the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The situation of the crushed, colonised, wounded, killed Palestinian population must not continue. We Europeans, through our values of solidarity and fraternity, have a responsibility to find a solution to this situation quickly, before it turns into a bloodbath. The Israeli Government is continuing its colonisations by forced march, and this after it committed war crimes at the start of this year. Symbols and tears are no longer enough. Today, the only solution to stop this deadly policy of the Israeli Government is the recognition and, above all, the existence of the Palestinian State. The Palestinian people, like other peoples, have a right to a dignified existence that fulfils their aspirations. As President of the Commission, and together with Mrs Ashton, will you take action along these lines and, if so, how? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied by the response that Commissioner Dimas was able to give on this issue and, in particular, by his speaking of the importance of aid beyond the borders of our continent. In addition to environmental protection of the Mediterranean Sea, might one formally propose, as part of the Union for the Mediterranean project, this emergency aid in the event of fire and the development of forestry expertise on this subject, to be shared and developed with the non-European countries of the Union for the Mediterranean? Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioners, in my view there has been an extraordinary degree of misinformation during this debate. Why? Because, in the first instance, we had an exhibition – I think Polish Members arranged it – that looks as if it is on the part of citizens but, when you look more closely, it turns out it is financed by a coalition of shale gas industry associations. I would say that is false advertising; it is masquerading as something it is not! That is the problem we have with this exhibition. Secondly, you may have forgotten, but the Commissioners mentioned it, there are reports which the Commission requested. I would ask you to read them carefully, because the report on the environment shows all too clearly that there is a risk of polluting surface water and groundwater and of depleting water resources. The impact on the soil can be devastating and can also lead to atmospheric pollution. Yet people say there are no such risks. It is not a question of being for or against shale gas, because decisions on energy mix are a question of national sovereignty. Our task, as elected officials, as MEPs, is to protect the European public. These reports show that there are clearly identified shortcomings in the legislation: poor adaptation of the Water Framework Directive, management of waste needs to be integrated into the Mining Waste Directive, and fracking needs to be integrated into the Environmental Impact Assessments Directive. If we do not overcome these failings, we will face serious difficulties, as seen in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, companies should be fully liable. They should have to prove that they have sufficient financial guarantees to honour the polluter pays principle in the event of environmental damage. It is not up to industry to decide what our energy future will be, but up to the citizens. Finally, with the support of around a hundred MEPs, we have tabled an amendment calling for a moratorium on fracking in the European Union. I hope as many MEPs as possible will remember their responsibilities when it comes to voting and will show that lobbyists do not hold all the power in Brussels.

 Mr President, Mr Grzyb, I would like to stress that Poland is in breach of the Water Framework Directive. You have already been asked to adhere to the standards laid down in that directive. The second problem with fracking is its social acceptability. The Commissioner mentioned this earlier. When people are made aware that exploitation comes with risks, it is still up to them to decide, as was the case in France and Bulgaria. At the same time, in relation to the risk presented by CO2
, which came up just now, shale gas cannot replace all sources of energy. You have to develop renewables. Europe is doing just that, Commissioner Oettinger spoke about it, and you also have the opportunity to do so in Poland. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I have a similar question. The problem with this exhibition is not that industrialists want to hold an exhibition. There’s no problem with that, but they must say that they are industrialists. When we have NGOS, they say they are NGOs. The problem here is the attempt to deceive us: we do not know who they really are, and when you scratch beneath the surface, as Mr Turmes said, you find out they are actually from the shale gas industry. That is what is not right and not the fact that lobbies can come to Parliament to try to influence people. There must be total transparency about who people are. Michèle Rivasi,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group
. – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since we are going to give our opinion this week on the discharge of European agencies that are under suspicion about their management, since our institutions are deemed to be too open to the lobbies and it seems that the transparency measures taken so far have not succeeded in resolving these problems, since we rightly want exemplary, certified institutions without any conflicts of interest, since the Commission’s reputation is once again in tatters, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but also on behalf of numerous other Members of the European Parliament of all political persuasions, I want to ask you about the resignation of John Dalli and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, which has been planned for a long time. This unexpected affair is intriguing and has left me somewhat bewildered. There is something fishy about this alleged story of corruption and we have the right to find out all the details. Of course, Commissioners must not be above the law. They must answer for themselves like any other citizen. However, nor must Commissioners must be beneath the law and I have the feeling that John Dalli is being deprived of basic rights and, in particular, the presumption of innocence while there is no concrete and direct proof of his guilt. Several questions come to mind, therefore, and I would like the Commission to give us some insight into this affair. What legal provision, what regulation or what Treaty has Mr Dalli infringed with his behaviour? What is the Commission’s view of his alleged guilt? Is it not possible that this affair might be a manoeuvre to derail the Tobacco Products Directive? Commissioner, I would ask you to give us some details about this extraordinary situation and I call on OLAF to send us its report as soon as possible Moreover, I read Mr Barroso’s letter assuring us that the Tobacco Products Directive would not be postponed. However, we would like more information about the timetable, which is already more than a year behind. This long-awaited Directive is ready and I would ask the Commission to make every effort to implement it. Are we going to have to wait until Tonio Borg takes up his post? We believe that this is extremely urgent from a health perspective and that the Directive should therefore get back on track, because if we do not do it now, it will have to wait until the next parliamentary term. Who will win in that case? The tobacco lobby! Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially Mr Áder and Mr Seeber, for their valuable work on the revision of the Seveso Directive. As we debate the Seveso Directive, my thoughts turn to the accident that occurred in France, AZF – you will recall – in Toulouse. On 21 September 2001, a stock of ammonium nitrate exploded killing 31 people and wounding a further 2 500, who are still traumatised to this day. The damage caused was unbelievable. This was not due to the lack of risk assessment management. It was due to the subcontracting of subcontractors, that is to say, untrained people. The training of employees is also the best form of security. In any event, give or take a few minor details, I am pleased with the final result, in particular, the essential advances in the management of industrial risks, against which we need to protect our citizens in the race to underinvestment in safety features by integrating the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. This is very important for informing citizens in the interests of transparency, and it is a sine qua non
 of the organisation of an effective risk management plan. I have one reservation, Commissioner, which is that there is no assessment of the financial consequences of a major accident and proof of the capacity of companies to address them. That, in my opinion, is a shortcoming of this directive. Michèle Rivasi,

 Mr President, it is good that we have this resolution on water because it is proof of Parliament’s good intentions. I would like to highlight some problems. Firstly, in terms of water management. As we speak, the World Water Forum is being held in Marseille. Yet, as you know, there is strong criticism with regard to the conflict of interest arising from the fact that the president of this World Water Forum, Loïc Fauchon, is also the chief executive of the Marseille water service (Société des eaux de Marseille
), an affiliate of Veolia. This has therefore become a commercial forum rather than a general interest to see water become a shared global resource. In terms of water management, it is very important that water management is reallocated to local authorities under direct state supervision. This forum ended with a declaration claiming that private investment can guarantee the right to water, which logically leads the debate towards the privatisation of water systems. This is a problem for both European and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The second problem concerns water and health. When we see that 88% of the diseases in the world come from drinking dirty water, poor hygiene practices or inadequate sanitation services, we must seriously invest in the treatment of industrial waste water and waste water in particular, which are poured untreated into nature. This, nevertheless, represents 70% of waste water. My final point relates to water and energy. We cannot replace water. Yet, as you know, the problem of shale gas management may lead to problems with groundwater pollution, hence the importance of the framework directive on groundwater, where they realised in Canada and the United States that it could cause pollution. Therefore, if we are fighting for water quality, we must do so at all levels. Michèle Rivasi,

Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, and the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Polish Presidency on their constructive work. From now on, consumers will be guaranteed better information. Ms Ries spoke about the sofas imported from Asian countries that contained fungicides and we all know the consequences these had for consumers, including extensive skin problems and severe erythema. Consumers should absolutely have been informed that items had been treated, but that was not the case until now. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is essential to reinforce the substitution of highly dangerous active substances by strengthening the exclusion criteria but also by limiting the derogations and introducing national guarantees for the adjustment of the conditions of use of product authorisations. We welcome, too, Commissioner, the specific and detailed provisions on nanomaterials, which you mentioned. This is a very important matter because we will be informed, there will be labelling, and substances such as nano-silver will have to be specifically authorised and assessed separately, which is justification for the validity of the methods used for the supporting assessment. The only damper on things – as has been mentioned – is that Parliament has lost its right of veto regarding the approval of active substances. It would seem that that was the price we had to pay for these improvements. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would actually like to inform my fellow Members, since we were there with Ms Herczog in Cadarache, that the ITER project is not insured. Since we are trying to keep the ITER budget under control, I have asked the question twice, and I have been told: ‘But it is not … (The President asked the speaker to ask her question)

 Mr President, I would like to raise two points that I feel are important. When we talk about generating electricity using this fusion, rather than fission reactor, we are talking about starting in 2100. Therefore, it is not really the most important priority at present. Secondly, people have been talking about keeping the budget under control, and I completely agree. The only problem is that in 2006, the budget was EUR 5 billion, whereas in 2011 it is EUR 15 billion: in other words, three times higher. On top of this, because of Fukushima the Japanese are now saying they will not be able to meet their commitments in two years’ time. This means that ITER will be delayed by another two years. A third factor, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, is that this is the first time that a facility like ITER, which entails certain risks, primarily of disruption – and I would invite you to read the studies that have been written on the subject – has not been insured. Why will the Indians, the Chinese and the Russians not insure it? It is because they do not want to increase the ITER budget any further. We are therefore setting ourselves on a collision course, and it would be better to stop now, rather than pour billions into a project that supposedly will be ready by 2100. For this reason, it is time we put an end to ITER. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I am grateful to Ms Ford for the work she has done, but I would like to point out that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution, one of the key points of which concerns the protection of sensitive natural areas, and specifically the Arctic. Indeed, granting exploration or exploitation licences means accepting liability, in the event of an accident of the kind we saw in the Gulf of Mexico and also in Scotland, for irreversible or very destructive damage in this unique part of the world. Furthermore, one is entitled to ask who is going to clean up this site in the event of an accident, since it is not an exclusive economic zone, and who defines its borders and hence the responsibilities relating to it: it is an area that belongs to everyone. I should like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to a number of points, the first of which is supervision. Supervision needs to be enhanced, but it would be good if it were carried out at European level and if the Maritime Safety Agency were responsible for it. Secondly, responsibilities need to be clearly defined. Amendment 76 establishes the full liability of oil companies, without any upper limit. At the same time, Amendment 47 defines civil liability, which covers not only environmental damage, but also social and economic damage, with guaranteed financial capacity to cover mandatory insurance. Including small oil companies in our deliberations is all well and good, but if they do not have any insurance, there is no point in granting them a licence. These points are therefore very important. Michèle Rivasi,

 Madam President, with what is happening with e.coli at the moment in Germany, France and other countries, I am a little surprised to note that it could be agued that, now we have solved the problem of animal-based meal, we should be able to give it to non-ruminants, including pigs, poultry and fish. To start with, I used to think that we do in fact have a lot of animal-based meal and that we could give it to all non-ruminants and herbivores, eliminate everything to give it to omnivores or carnivores. In fact, however, I see that, even if there were a whole set of constraints in place, we would not succeed. How are we going to monitor the existence of differentiated sectors? Let us take the example of a farm on which poultry and cattle co-exist. There will be animal-based meal for the poultry and other food for the cattle. The operator can easily make a mistake and give to the cattle what he gave to the poultry; there will be no guarantee, even if monitoring is carried out. I therefore asked a number of scientists, who told me that, as regards the problem of prion, which caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, there were still a huge number of scientific uncertainties. As far as consumers are concerned therefore – I know, Mr Dalli, that you are highly sensitive to the health of consumers – we must regain their confidence. You saw what happened with e.coli and you know the story about the cucumber. We learned that the cucumber was not to blame. I cannot see how, at the present time, farmers can be authorised to give animal-based meal to pigs and poultry. I believe that the solution is to say that our scientific knowledge is incomplete, draconian control and monitoring cannot be carried out, even if it is written into the texts, and that, as a precaution, it is better to place a ban on the feeding of animal-based meal to all animals.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire 
stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors. We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting. 80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors. Furthermore, we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risks. When we look at these stress tests as they relate to France, they become ‘relaxation tests’. Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France. This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue, but must be a European issue, the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I would nevertheless like to remind my fellow Members that the Fukushima accident is not over and that there are still risks of explosion relating to the molten core. I have a question to put to our Commissioner, Mr Oettinger. It is about the implementation of these stress tests. As our fellow Member has just said, how will you get a guarantee that all the criteria that you have mentioned to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are taken into account by each Member State that uses nuclear power stations? How will you force a Member State to allow independent experts to verify and monitor the power stations if it refuses? The reason I ask this is that, if they monitor themselves, I do not see how we will apply your stress tests. There absolutely must be an independent body monitoring the power stations in each Member State. How, furthermore, will we ensure that neighbouring countries – you spoke of Armenia, with Metsamor, and of other countries such as Belarus, and so on – accept such monitoring? Parliament will have to support you, Commissioner, but how will we do this? Finally, we have a real responsibility to phase out nuclear power, and this is where scenarios for achieving this must be proposed to Parliament. It is the only guarantee that there will be no further accidents. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, first of all something positive, Mr Barroso. I welcome the fact that you are going to adjust the European maximum levels in line with Japan’s levels, because at the time of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011, we realised that the levels proposed by the Commission were far too high. I welcome this therefore, and would like to see it incorporated into this regulation. My second point concerns imports of food products from Japan. There is a fundamental issue here. Are we going to be obliged to have contaminated food, although the contamination is below the maximum levels, in order to support the Japanese economy? I am sure you have children. I think to myself, am I going to give my children milk containing 500 Bq of iodine when there is an alternative milk with 0 Bq of iodine? I wonder if the Commission should perhaps consider blocking food and feed imported from Japan because it may be contaminated and instead help and support the Japanese people themselves, either financially or with uncontaminated foodstuffs. Lastly, I have an appeal to make to you Mr Barroso. I have been approached by Areva, who have travelled to Japan where their equipment had been blocked and is in storage at the airport. It is very important for you, if possible, to request the Japanese Government to release the equipment: the whole system including masks, robots and so on that has been blocked at the airport.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I fully endorse what Mrs Lepage has said and I would ask the following question: is it an opportunity or a predictable ecological disaster? We are nonetheless 10 years behind the United States in terms of exploitation. What can we see? We can see that the groundwater has been contaminated by the chemicals that have permeated this hydraulic fracturing. We can also see air pollution. We can now see that there are volatile organic compounds (VOC) and even ozone has appeared because of all the substances released into the air. We can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and, of course, the users of the phreatic nappes, because they can no longer drink the water they contain. Last week, the New York Times reported that, as well as polluting the groundwater with hydrocarbons and biocides, the contamination also emits radioactive elements. In France, as Mrs Lepage pointed out, eight licences were signed without any debate, without any consultation, without any impact assessment. And you talk of social acceptability? There is genuine rebellion. The latest demonstrations in the département of Ardèche were attended by more than 20 thousand people precisely because they care about their land. And you say, ‘It is an economic opportunity’. But whom does this gas benefit? Are we talking about cui bono
? Is it about choosing gas for the needs of industry to the detriment of the reserves of water in the phreatic nappes? The New York moratorium is a good illustration of the problem. We are therefore simply requesting that the licences be revoked. For explorations to take place while we have no guarantee of compliance with the Groundwater Framework Directive, the Air Quality Framework Directive or the Aarhus Convention is out of the question. We therefore await your responses and we will refuse, in Europe, in France and in the countries involved, to allow these non-conventional forms of gas to be exploited in the absence of these guarantees. Michèle Rivasi,

 Mr President, we all remember that H1N1 influenza was big news in 2009. The first cases were reported almost two years ago – on 25 March 2009 – and the WHO declared a phase 6 alert level on 11 June 2009. This maximum alert level issued by the WHO triggered a series of measures in Europe, including the activation of immunisation campaigns in several Member States which not only were very costly but were also overestimated in relation to the known severity of the virus, which, as the WHO stated at that time in May 2009, was moderate. As regards severity, up to the end of April 2010, this flu had caused around 2 900 deaths in Europe, in other words, a much lower mortality rate than that related to seasonal flu, which causes an estimated 40 000 - 220 000 deaths per year depending on the year. Meanwhile, the estimated costs were close to EUR 1.3 billion in the United Kingdom and over EUR 700 million in France according to the latest Court of Auditors report. The evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza shows that there was a disproportionate response in the European Union and the Member States. I and my colleagues, whom I would like to thank for their amendments, have therefore tried to produce a constructive report which aims to restore the confidence of European citizens in their health institutions. The report is structured around three major themes: cooperation, transparency and independence. In terms of cooperation, we are keen to stress the need for coherence, effectiveness, autonomy and flexibility. Future flu prevention plans, for example, must be revised in such a way as to guarantee greater coherence and effectiveness and must be made self-contained and flexible enough that they can be adapted in real time according to the latest available data. This kind of flexibility would have saved our public purses a good deal of unnecessary expense. At the same time, it is important to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the key players responsible for managing health risks. The definition of a pandemic itself must be revised so that it includes the concept of severity and does not just take account of geographical spread. Indeed, the WHO has informed us that it has this in hand. Group purchasing of vaccines is a possibility, provided that the manufacturers remain liable for the quality, safety and efficacy of their products. Under no circumstances must governments be made liable for side effects of vaccines that are supposed to be safe. As regards independence, the fast-track authorisation procedure has highlighted the problem of the lack of available scientific data. Research into vaccines and antiviral treatments must be conducted with complete independence from the pharmaceutical companies. In terms of transparency, total transparency is needed concerning the evaluation of drugs used for health emergencies, with full access to the clinical trials available. All declarations of interest on the part of the experts responsible for the evaluations must be made public. I have one regret: I would have preferred them to be checked by the agencies who recruit these experts, but this amendment was not adopted. Finally, I would like to highlight the cases of narcolepsy that have been reported in children in Finland and Sweden following vaccination with GSK’s H1N1 influenza vaccine. These cases need our attention. In the first instance, they clearly demonstrate that there are still grey areas, both in relation to the actual toxicity of the vaccines and adjuvants and in relation to possible risks as yet unknown to the manufacturers themselves. Finland has suspended the use of this vaccine until more information is available. This is not the position of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has decided instead to wait until more information is available before issuing any opinion on restricting the use of this vaccine. I would like to see the Commission adopt the same position as Finland. It is time that the precautionary principle benefited patients for once instead of always benefiting the companies.

Madam President, having participated in the observation mission to Haiti last September, I was able to realise the emergencies to be dealt with. Now we have to look beyond these emergencies to finally reach the development stage. We do not have to reconstruct but rather to construct a country whose foundations and governance have never been strong. One thing is clear, as my fellow Members have said: there are 20 million tonnes of rubble to clear and only 5%, a minute part, has been cleared in a year. At this rate, it will take more than six years to clear the ruins in Port-au-Prince. It is therefore a political project in itself and the Commission has to contribute to it. Another priority is governance and I am pleased that the European Union is making a major contribution to budgetary support for the country. We have to increase this financial effort because it is the only means of restoring competences to the Haitian country and people. Its current dependency on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is seen at the level of basic public services such as health and education. We must not, however, subcontract all public services to NGOs. Above all, we have to increase our support to organise elections quickly and complete these elections, which, I hope, should enable a corrupt political elite to be replaced. At present, an oligarchy of allegedly 20 families prevents any economic development because it controls trade but, at the same time, does nothing to develop the country’s production capacity. Finally, we have to give Haiti the resources to emerge from the dependency that was already undermining it even before the earthquake. Therefore, I call upon European institutions to establish consistent priorities and to give massive support to setting up public services with strong commitment from the future Haitian Government.

Mr President, on the subject of this text that we voted for, I would like to draw your attention – and I must congratulate Mrs McAvan for the quality of her work – to an omission regarding guinea pig populations. In fact, there is one point that has been neglected, which, on account of the agreement concluded in first reading, could not be the subject of an oral amendment: it is a question of people used as guinea pigs for clinical tests of a medicine or vaccine conducted before authorisation in order to check its harmlessness or its risk-benefit balance. These people may include men, women, children or elderly people; in this text, we are concerned with the follow-up of the possible side-effects of drugs for human use. In fact, it must be pointed out that these people who participate in clinical tests are kept in ignorance as regards the substance ingested or injected and that the effects are only likely to be triggered ten, twenty or thirty years later. These guinea pigs are the forgotten people of pharmacovigilance and it is important to remember this and mention it. Michèle Rivasi,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, I am going to take one minute and I shall speak for a further minute afterwards. I should like to speak first as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, for this report. I should like to say that it is very important in this sector to provide patients with better protection and better information, but also to fight against the stranglehold exerted by the pharmaceutical industry, which wanted to collect reports of side effects and to analyse and interpret the results. At the level of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – and, moreover, at the level of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – we therefore succeeding in ensuring that, when it comes to the collection of reports, doctors and patients will be the ones able to report side effects for transmission to the national authorities. As far as analysis and interpretation are concerned, the Member States are responsible for detecting and monitoring the adverse reactions of medicinal products. It transpired, in connection with the outbreak of H1N1 influenza, that it was the Swedish national authorities which referred to narcolepsy even though, until now, the H1N1 vaccine had not been associated with such side effects. This is very important. On the other hand, I am very disappointed that we have not achieved financial independence from the national authorities. Finally, as far as controls are concerned, there has been real progress in relation to this Pharmacovigilance Committee, which is separate from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and I hope that there will also be more information available for patients, either on package leaflets or in terms of ultra-vigilance. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I would like to come back to the environmental impact of medicinal products. Since 1965, Europe has established criteria for obtaining marketing authorisations. There are three criteria, namely efficacy, safety and the pharmaceutical quality of the medicinal product, but there is nothing about the environmental impact of medicinal products. As you know, the oestrogen found in river waters is changing the sex of fish. As you also know, there are high levels of residues of medicinal products in purification plants and in waste water from hospitals. There has been a fair amount of discussion on this matter; a debate has been held and, in the Pharmacovigilance Directive, it has finally been taken into account in the form of a recital calling on the Commission to publish a report, on the basis of data provided by the European Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Member States, on the scale of the problem and an assessment of whether or not it would be appropriate or useful to amend EU legislation on medicinal products or in other areas. What I want of the Commission is a proper report based on these data, because this indirectly affects human health in that, in numerous cases, it is the consumption of water that caused the side effects identified. Michèle Rivasi,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, I consider that progress has been made in this text, including on two fundamental aspects: the need for labelling if nanoparticles are present in a product and, more importantly, the fact that each of these nanosubstances will also be subject to separate evaluation, which is not currently the case. Progress has also been made in terms of the possibility of excluding endocrine disrupters from substances used, with specific and properly applicable exclusion criteria. But – there is a but – we disagree on the actual resources for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), because that agency’s mission should be to evaluate and authorise biocidal products. However, we have just extended the ECHA’s mission; we agree with that, but extending it means giving the ECHA the resources to really do its job. We cannot ask the ECHA to do a lot more work, to reduce substance evaluation times, while, at the same time, reducing its resources. If we do so, we risk coming up against simplified assessments, which may well be fast, but which will be superficial and therefore inadequate. That is why I call on you, Mrs Klaß, to reconsider your budgetary proposal concerning the ECHA missions in this dossier. As it stands, I must say that your proposal is not a serious one, and this will affect the standard of work of that European institution, which is essential to the safety of European citizens and consumers. This is an important issue. You cannot demand more if the resources are not available, or else the ECHA will just be an administrative agency which responds to the industrial lobby.

 Mr President, I would like to make the connection between the scanner, health and terrorism. What does the Interagency Committee on Radioprotection, which brings together the European Commission, the IAEA – the International Atomic Energy Agency – and the Nuclear Energy Agency say? It says that pregnant women and children must not be subjected to body scans, even if the doses are extremely small. Indeed, we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations. My question therefore concerns justification of the risks. Given the existence of alternative technologies that enable the same goals to be achieved, these scanners really do need to be justified in relation to the given objective, and we need to know … (The President cut off the speaker) Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, for my part, would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine. Currently, the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation, and I would like to share a number of concerns with you. Firstly, what is the relationship between the risks and benefits? At the moment, the benefits are few, since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths – nowhere near as many as seasonal flu, in any case. With regard to the risks, on the other hand, we have enough time to consider this aspect, and I would like, in particular, to address the problem of adjuvants. I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd: in the United States, the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited, but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene. The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype. I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, the current situation of migrants is a legacy of the past. With this motion for a resolution, we wish to galvanise the new Libyan Government to action with regard to migrants’ rights and to make clear that we would like very much and are prepared to assist it in establishing new policies towards migrants and asylum seekers, as this is a crucial issue. Non-governmental organisations working in Libya have reported numerous human rights violations, including sexual violence towards children and women.  Finally, in order to ensure better protection of migrants’ rights, it is vital that Libya, which has successfully started out on the path to democracy, should draw a line under the past and the legacy of the dictatorship by ratifying international conventions, including, of course, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the political message of this report, which calls on the European Union to make signature of the EU-Kazakhstan enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement dependent on progress on democracy, respect for human rights and freedom of the press. I condemn the decision of the Appellate Court in Aktau to sentence the opposition politician Vladimir Kozlov to seven and a half years in prison. His trial, monitored closely by the international community, has been described as staged, as a ‘Soviet-style’ trial. There is absolutely no concrete evidence against Mr Kozlov. He is accused of having spoken out against his country when abroad, in particular in his speeches in the European Parliament. It is unacceptable for opponents and defenders of human rights invited to Parliament to be at risk once they return home and even imprisoned. That calls into question the very credibility of this House. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, if this new generation is not given pens, they will be given guns by terrorists. Those are the words of Malala, who, at the age of 14, understands fully that educating children and combating obscurantism go hand in hand. Besides the case of this young Pakistani girl, who has become a symbol, I would remind you that young girls in Afghanistan have to deal with this unacceptable situation every day. The extensive violence to which they are subjected no longer makes the headlines, as it did 10 years ago, when we wanted to justify our military action in Afghanistan on the grounds of emancipating Afghan women. I must therefore repeat it again: we cannot forget them. That is the message that the Afghan parliamentarians wanted to get across when they visited the European Parliament a few weeks ago. They fear that in 2014, after the ISAF forces withdraw, the rights they have obtained over this last decade will quite simply be exchanged for a return to calm during the negotiations between the Afghan Government and the Taliban. For that reason, we must continue to condemn tirelessly these archaic practices. Above all, however, the European Union must provide financial support for the local women’s associations who are fighting to keep the schools open. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask you if you are aware of the reports of the European Union’s ambassadors and delegations in Jerusalem, which have stated clearly in recent years that we cannot guarantee the traceability of products from Israel and thus identify and distinguish products from the settlements. I would like to know if you are aware of these reports because I am astonished that you say that products from the settlements are not involved. In addition, have you also heard that in many countries, and mine in particular, consumers regularly spot products from the settlements on our markets? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not a simple technical agreement. It means stronger EU-Israeli relations and free access to Europe’s single market even though the EU decided in 2009 to suspend the upgrading of its economic relations with Israel. Supporting this agreement means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal settlement of the Palestinian territories; it means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza. The reports by our ambassadors in Jerusalem recommend that we adopt binding measures to put an end to the settlements. The European Union has stated that the Israeli settlement policy is an obstacle to peace so, for the sake of consistency, if we adopt the ACAA we should refuse the Nobel Peace Prize.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that we should condemn such a blatant violation of human rights and such an outburst of violence, which serve as a reminder for South Africa of the darkest days of its history. I want to highlight the fact that today, South Africa, which is often lauded as a model of democracy, has an opportunity to show us that it is capable of applying the fundamental principles of this democracy, namely, impartial justice and respect for the rule of law. I am therefore pleased that a committee of inquiry has been established in order to shed light on the tragic events of 16 August, but it seems to me that it is essential that we also condemn the use of common purpose law, a throwback to apartheid, which has only served to crystallise the anger in the country a little more. In South Africa, as in many African states, the wealth of mineral resources is in stark contrast to the rising poverty of part of the population. This part of the population, which is crying out for change, with the fall of the apartheid regime, is, on the contrary, seeing growing social inequalities and a new economic apartheid take root. The sharing of natural resources remains a key issue on the African continent, and multinationals must shoulder their responsibilities in the current conflicts. That is why Europe must promote another kind of economic and human development in these regions, by stopping imports of mining products extracted without social or environmental guarantees. In conclusion, I would add that this situation should give us cause to reflect, because in South Africa, as in other countries around the world, democracy does not simply mean free elections, but also more social justice.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on this excellent result. The compromise reached between the institutions paves the way for real progress on uniting the European continent to help particularly vulnerable people who are the victims of crime. This directive will reinforce a series of measures implemented at European level to promote the free movement and the defence of victims of crime, such as the European protection order. We can welcome the result of this trialogue, for example, the definition of gender-based violence, even though it only appears in the recitals rather than the articles. We must also welcome the fact that all victims have been included, regardless of their status, particularly their residence status. From now on, the most vulnerable people will have the right, in European territory, to protection and consideration of their needs. The text recognises the impact of crime, not only on the victim, but also on close family members, including children. Despite these advances, I would like to underline the need to consider violence against women as a social phenomenon as such and, like a number of my colleagues, I call on the Commission to prepare a specific directive on this issue.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution on EU policy on the occupied Palestinian territories. This text provides a comprehensive account of reality on the ground and openly denounces the rampant expansion of Israeli settlements, the extremism of the settlers, the expulsions and the demolition of Palestinian houses. I welcome the fact that Parliament unequivocally calls on the Israeli authorities to end the expansion of the settlements and once again reiterates the official position of the European Union, which is that Europe will not recognise any unilateral change to the borders of the future state of Palestine. I regret, however, that this resolution lacks ambition. Parliament does not openly recognise that the existing control mechanism – the 2005 technical agreement concluded by the Commission with the Israeli authorities – has never been effectively implemented and that products from the Israeli settlements continue to be imported into the European market labelled ‘made in Israel’. Instead of calling on the Commission to create a new legally binding control mechanism, Parliament is content to request that the Union’s existing legislation be implemented.

 Mr President, the issue of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Africa keeps appearing on the parliamentary agenda, and with good reason. Two thirds of African countries have repressive laws in this area and, as has already been mentioned, South Africa is currently regressing on this issue. Today, I would like to talk to you about the documentary made in Uganda by two women on the situation of LGBT people. During filming, in 2010, David Kato, an iconic figure in the fight of LGBTs in Africa, was assassinated. This documentary then changed dimension, and the message of tolerance and hope it bears must be disseminated as widely as possible. I would therefore like to invite you to see this film, which is entitled Call me Kuchu
, and to encourage its distribution in all Member States to let them know of the fate of the Kuchus and to not let silence make them disappear. I will leave you with this phrase spoken by David Kato: ‘They keep saying we do not exist, but we definitely do’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that in several Member States, including France, it is consumer associations and human rights organisations which carry out controls on the origin of products labelled ‘Made in Israel’, and these groups regularly denounce the presence on our markets of products originating in illegal settlements. It is not a rare occurrence. In a spirit of ethical consumption, civil society therefore tries to ensure the traceability of products imported from Israel, as the European Union has shown that it is incapable of implementing the 2005 technical agreement in accordance with international law. You will understand that I am very sceptical and dubious that you will give us guarantees, as you should, on legally binding provisions ensuring that no more products from the settlements are entering the European market. I should like to point out that, with regard to medicines, the children of Gaza not only do not have medicines, but do not even have access to drinking water or enough food to sustain themselves. I think it is important to keep in mind the global context, which, from a humanitarian and human rights point of view, is a dramatic context, and we cannot content ourselves with simply talking about trade without talking about that.

Mr President, the Sahel region, which has already been severely affected by climate change and weakened by the presence of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), has been destabilised by the war in Libya and the return of heavily armed mercenaries. The risk of a merger between certain Islamist groups and the Tuareg rebellion are concerning but should force us to understand the reasons behind them. The financial austerity policies that have been imposed in Africa for 30 years by international institutions, external interference and the exploitation of natural resources have led to impoverishment. In Mali, the population has barely seen the positive social and economic effects that should have come about through gold production. Mali is the third largest producer of gold in Africa. The Malian mining code does not provide for any restriction on mining companies in terms of environmental and social responsibility. This weakness in the legislation makes Mali extremely attractive. Now uranium is being coveted by a French company, which is drilling and working with absolutely no regard for the population and the environment, causing many inhabitants of the Faléa commune to protest. In Niger, France has been exploiting uranium for 40 years and the situation of the local population has not improved at all. On 25 April, the staff of the Imouraren site initiated a strike to protest against disastrous working conditions, claiming that they were working 12 hours a day. In Niger, 60% of exports rely on uranium, and the country provides close to 40% of the stock for Areva, which plans to develop what will be the second largest uranium mine in the world. Niger is classed as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of the human development index. The local population is mainly Tuareg and has long suffered the almost irreversible health consequences of this irresponsible exploitation: air pollution and contamination of the region’s scarce water resources. In conclusion, Europe must therefore promote further economic and human development in this region. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, let me tell you about my personal experience in this regard. In the context of decentralised cooperation, I had the opportunity to work with associations in Africa and came face to face with the reality of female genital mutilation, about which Ms De Keyser has just spoken. Our resolution stresses the importance of relying on local authorities and NGOs. Taking into account the realities on the ground is essential in the fight against these practices. For example, in any programme to combat female genital mutilation, it must be borne in mind that, for the women who practise it, it is a professional activity. It is sometimes their only source of income, and I know from experience that many of these women are more than willing to abandon the practice if they are offered reintegration into the labour market. I particularly wanted to share this testimony with you, as it is my personal experience. I would also like to stress the exemplary value of the delegations we send to third countries, which must ensure equal representation, as this is the best way of advancing the cause of gender equality.

If we were to compare the statements made by NATO and the Council with information coming from Afghan civil society and the NGOs, you would think that they were talking about two different countries: the resurgence of the Taliban, who are champing at the bit to stamp their authority on the entire country and take their revenge on those who collaborated with the West. I refer of course to women, and I remember how, in 2001, the plight of Afghan women was exploited to justify a military intervention that the population had not asked for. After the bombings and destruction, they were promised reconstruction, peace and democracy. They have failed. According to the Minister, Mr Eftekhari, 6 million children are suffering from extreme poverty, abuse and violence. Under pressure from the Taliban, schools have been burned, teachers threatened and killed. Nearly 550 girls’ schools have closed their doors in 11 provinces. Young people flee the country to come to the West, the land of promise. There is no point dwelling on the reception or rather the lack of reception waiting for them in Europe: we should be ashamed of ourselves. In addition, Pakistan and Iran have decided to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from their countries. Given the EU’s commitment to the Afghan people, are we prepared, Baroness Ashton, at Council level and in the European External Action Service (EEAS), to adopt a plan to help and take in these refugees? Will we welcome and support the threatened teachers, the women’s rights activists, all those who have put their trust in us and who have to choose … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues and to express my gratitude for the very interesting contributions I have received for this report which, I hope, will be the start of a growing awareness on the part of our institutions. In an ideal Parliament, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality would not exist and issues relating to gender and discrimination against women would be spontaneously integrated into all the matters we deal with here, because this is a cross-cutting issue. However, it is necessary to continue to drive the point home without any let-up because we Members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have a responsibility to remove women from the blind spot of European policies. This is particularly true of environmental issues. I would even go so far as to say that we will show in our report that women are not the green plants of ecology. The figures are staggering. Women are 14 times more likely to die during cyclones, floods and earthquakes. In the tsunami that affected Asia in 2004, for example, and also in the heat wave that hit Europe in 2003, 70% of the victims were women. Why? Women do not have the same resources – economic, social or political – to adapt or even to flee. On the other hand, in Honduras, thanks to a warning and disaster management system which included women from the outset, La Masica was the only town not to record a single death during and after hurricane Mitch. Climate change remains an absolute priority but, in a context of economic crisis, ecology is not the only thing to regress. Women’s rights, too, are eroded and it is by linking the two that we are proposing a coherent political vision and effective solutions. In the past, whenever there was a crisis, whenever there was revolution, we were told that women’s rights would come afterwards. This line of reasoning is out of date and unsound. The challenges of climate change and that of justice and equality for women are intrinsically linked. Women are not only victims to be protected. Women also have knowledge and proposals to make: not because they are, of course, different, but because we live in a society where roles are often gendered. Being a woman or a man has an impact on our daily lives, from the management of resources and access to education to the choice of occupation. These differences in experience are reflected in the solutions and ideas proposed. In the report, we have identified four types of measures. Firstly, measures of representation. We are calling for women’s representation of at least 40% in political, financial and technical bodies. The voice of women and their organisations must be heard and supported. Secondly, measures concerning protection and training, establishing a virtuous cycle for women, from victims to agents of change. Thirdly, measures of education, not only to open up the future green economy and encourage women to pursue scientific and technical careers, but also to support the necessary changes in lifestyle patterns. Finally, as regards research, we need data disaggregated by sex to be collected to improve our understanding of the subject and our policy proposals. To summarise the spirit of this report, we maintain that policies to combat climate change can be enriched through the integration of gender issues and that combating discrimination generates solutions that are more effective for the environment. It is a win-win line of reasoning. As we approach the Rio+20 Summit, it is clear that there are no simple solutions to a challenge as complex and pressing as climate change. It is by broadening our way of thinking that we will find the resources to make a significant change for the better. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I knew, after meeting Commissioner Hedegaard at a hearing organised by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, that we could count on her and on the Commission. I also know that we can count on the Danish Presidency having, in fact, heard a number of proposals. I would like to thank all my colleagues, men and women, who have spoken here today, because what they have said has simply reflected the work we have done collectively, which is very enriching for us all. I think this debate was necessary, and that we must, of course, continue to raise awareness. Each one of us here has contributed to this report and I am very satisfied. I know that we can also rely on the Institute for Gender Equality, which we created in Vilnius in 2011. I should nonetheless like to say something. I would like to pay tribute to all the women and women’s associations worldwide who have long understood that something had to be done about preserving resources and about climate issues. In some countries, women have known this for a long time. In this regard, I will mention India, where, within the Chipko movement, women attached themselves to trees to save them; Rwanda too, where women have preserved 600 kinds of beans. I would also like to pay homage to Wangari Maathai, whom no one here will have forgotten, who left us recently and who, with her Green Belt movement, preserved millions of trees. Women in developing countries recognised the need to take action a long time ago and we know we can count on them. A final point, which has been raised several times, is the issue of quotas. My political group and I, personally, are very much in favour of this tool. It is only a tool, per se
, but it has enabled us to become the only political group with equal representation in this Parliament. I believe it is the only way, unfortunately, to move things forward. If we do not use this tool of allocating quotas, we will not succeed in advancing gender equality. It is simply a tool. Finally, if you will permit me, I shall quote Einstein, who said, ‘Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, it is true that Kazakhstan is the most open country in Central Asia, economically speaking. European investments are welcome there and companies such as Total, Eni, Areva and Alstom have operations there with major interests. It is also true that Europe is hoping to use this country as a route to transport its troops and military equipment out of Afghanistan. In view of its interests, Europe is remaining discreet and pragmatic towards the Kazakh authorities. However, are we not being too pragmatic at the risk of repeating the same mistakes we made with the Arab world? Moreover, that is what civil society in Kazakhstan, and in the former Soviet Union in general, is convinced that we are doing. We must therefore be attentive to what is actually happening in Kazakhstan. By freeing Ms Sokolova, the lawyer for the trade unionists, and Mr Zhovtis, the human rights defender, the Kazakh authorities are showing proof of goodwill. However, growing and continuing repression of the political opposition, the trade unionists and the independent media persists. Forty-three strikers in Zhanaozen are being threatened with long prison sentences, as are nine members of the opposition, Mr Kozlov, Mr Viniavski and Ms Amirova. We have seen unbelievable censorship of the electronic media to silence all alternative sources of information. Following the orders of the presidential Security Council, 125 websites, judged to be dangerous, have already been blocked, with 168 others on a blacklist. A series of recently promulgated laws tracks this regression in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan: laws on audio-visual material, the Internet and information and a law on religious communities. Although the Kazakh authorities are telling us that they learned their lesson from the tragedy in Zhanaozen, they have just promulgated a law on national security which severely limits freedom of expression and the freedom to change the labour code, which restricts the rights of workers. Are we going to, once again, content ourselves with verbal promises from the Kazakh authorities and continue with business as usual or are we going to openly say to our Kazakh partners that the repression of dissident voices cannot ensure long-term stability? The European Union will, in any case, have to commit to daily monitoring of the upcoming trials of the various strikers and opponents and ensure that the legislative reforms guarantee fundamental freedoms. All of these developments should determine our position on upgrading the partnership with Kazakhstan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I would like to make the most of Mr Borys’ knowledge about the country. Do you think, Mr Borys, that the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has had a positive impact on the development of the situation? If so, what kind of impact? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, in addressing the issue of quotas, Ms Reding has brought up an old debate on the legitimacy of binding legislative measures. As far as I am concerned, I am fully in favour of proactive, binding measures on the issue that we are considering today, since it is plain that matters are not progressing at all. At university, it has been said that at the top colleges there are brilliant female students who have far higher qualifications than their male colleagues. However, as soon as students enter the world of work, it is clear that difficulties arise and that women are not managing to break through the notorious glass ceiling. At European Union level, we cannot continue to do without the skills of half of the population, once referred to as ‘half of heaven’. What I would like to say to you is that I belong to a political organisation which enshrined equality in its own rules in 1984 in France, and that we have obtained brilliant results. We have had the first female regional president in France. We have had female candidates for the presidential elections. Currently in this Parliament, I am one of eight women elected out of a total of 15 MEPs, making more women than men. I therefore believe that when a decision is taken to move things forward, all that is needed is to take measures such as these in order to achieve equality. I am 100% in favour of these binding measures because parity seems vital to me. This is, quite simply, a question of justice. It is not a question of quotas. I believe that we must talk of parity, and not of quotas. Quotas are 30-40%; they are not justice. Justice is 50:50. I believe that we absolutely must achieve that. Madam President, I would like to propose to you that we should be setting an example, particularly in respect of the Member States; why should we not introduce parity in Parliament’s executive Bureau, from the next term? I think it would be important to start with that step. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to talk to you about Kazakhstan. Did you know that the massive oil workers’ strike which began last May in the province of Mangistau has resulted in brutal repression and the arrest of trade unionists and their lawyer? On 16 December, a peaceful protest at Zhanaozen ended in bloodshed. There were many injuries, at least 15 deaths, as well as arrests and incidents of mistreatment, torture and rape. The legislative elections of 15 January were deemed neither free nor democratic by observers. Finally, human rights defenders and militants from opposition parties recently invited to give their views before the Members of our Parliament were arrested upon their return and are facing long prison sentences. Faced with this authoritarian and repressive abuse, the European Union’s silence is unacceptable. How do you intend to react, Baroness Ashton, to what I have just told you? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Baroness Ashton stated that human rights should henceforth run as a silver thread throughout all of our external actions. The European Union is one of the main trading partners of Uzbekistan and a major importer of cotton. In view of conditions during the cotton harvest, Parliament is duty-bound to shoulder its moral responsibility and refuse to consent to this agreement as long as Uzbekistan continues to deny access to the independent mission of the International Labour Organisation, and until that mission confirms that reforms have been implemented, bringing an end to forced child labour. For the first time ever, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament can use its new powers and refuse to ratify a trade agreement in the name of human rights. Our action is therefore consistent with the values we defend, and conforms to what is being demanded by NGOs, trade unions and textile retailers’ groups, who are calling for ethical production. The ball is now in the Commission’s court, and it should withdraw the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for Uzbekistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, a great deal has been achieved in the four years since we implemented the EU strategy for Central Asia. The Union has established a continuous political dialogue and regular dialogues on human rights. Initiatives and important programmes have been activated in support of the EU’s seven priority areas. However, in light of the Arab Spring, and in the context of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan, which is already under way, bearing in mind the tragic events of southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, the limitations of our strategy are much more visible today, and this requires a major re-assessment on our part. The strategy is due to be reviewed by the European External Action Service in 2012, and we therefore considered that some key recommendations should be set out in the report, based on the following observation: the EU is unable to reconcile its values and interests in effective programmes that are adapted to the realities and developments in the region. Europe lacks visibility there. Its presence is still in its early stages. The funding devoted to the strategy is modest and would even appear to be under threat. We do not give sufficient open support to civil society, independent media or human rights defenders. Sometimes, in fact, it is pro-government foundations that benefit from European financial support, much to the frustration of genuine NGOs. In the light of this situation, the European Parliament is convinced that it should develop a new EU approach based on human security and regional cooperation. All our actions, projects and initiatives should follow the guiding principle of promoting human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Europe and its Western partners, who are bogged down in the quagmire of Afghanistan and concerned about their military bases in the region, have, for too long, given priority to the stability of the regimes in place rather than human rights. However, stability based on repression does not last long, and the Arab Spring is proof of that. We should be careful not to make the same mistakes twice, and we must be capable of better responding to the political vacuum that a similar change could trigger in Central Asia, in a context of ethnic and regional conflicts. In Kazakhstan, trade unions in the oil sector have been on strike for more than six months despite merciless repression. Early legislative elections will be held on 15 January 2012, against a backdrop of unprecedented social tension and the banning of political parties. Will we have the courage and honesty to tell the Kazhak Government that the EU will draw the appropriate conclusions from these events during negotiations on future partnership and cooperation agreements? We are alarmed by the Human Rights Watch report published yesterday on the indescribably cruel torture that is carried out in Uzbekistan prisons. In Tashkent, human rights defenders have just been arrested. We were happy to hear Baroness Ashton, in Parliament, insisting that human rights should henceforth form the backbone of all of our external action. We therefore recommend carrying out a review of our strategy for Central Asia. I am especially proud of the fact that Parliament has put conditionality and the principles of differentiation and ‘more for more’ at the heart of its new approach, while recommending that we should enhance our support for civil society and independent media organisations. The EU cannot be honest in one part of the world while failing to respond to violations of its values in another. Lastly, we should consider regional cooperation. The challenges these countries are facing call for a concerted approach: ethnic conflicts, water resource management, security problems, circulation of arms and trafficking of drugs and people. These threats directly affect the security and stability of Central Asia, and also of Europe. We therefore recommend that the EU should play the role of mediator and facilitator. In order to promote dialogue between these countries, we recommend establishing an ad hoc
 parliamentary forum, which the EU, through the European Parliament delegation, could propose to the parliaments of the five Central Asian countries. MEPs would thus be able to share their experience and expertise while meeting with their counterparts. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuation of the Israeli colonisation in Palestine has brought the peace talks to a standstill and has led the Palestinians to demand their accession to the UN, now that they have put in place credible political and economic institutions. Europe is dithering at a time when it should be adopting an independent position and asserting itself as a player on the international stage. According to a very recent poll, the majority of French, German and British citizens think that the Palestinians have the right to a State that should be recognised by the UN immediately. The fact is, we represent the citizens of Europe. The democratic awakening of the Arab world creates a new context which is likely to relaunch the peace process. The aspirations of young people are the same in Tunis, Cairo, Ramallah and Gaza. If we abandon the Palestinians, despair could lead to a new intifada, for which we would be responsible. It is in fact a historic opportunity that is being presented to the European Union. It should include the recognition of this Palestinian state in its policy of support for the Arab Spring, instead of exerting pressure on the Palestinian Authority to force it to abandon its claim to fully fledged statehood at the UN, and instead of working on the Israeli Government so that it finally agrees to respect international law.

 Mr President, I raised my blue card earlier on, but you did not see it. For I could have already asked Mr Provera the question I am asking Ms Ries, since they both used the same term –‘unilateral’ – several times. I would like them to explain what they mean by that and to also tell me how they define the building by Israel of hundreds of kilometres of wall and hundreds upon hundreds of houses in the settlements. I would like them to tell me how they can talk about unilateralism when we know that this initiative of recognising a Palestinian state is supported by 130 or 140 countries. I confess that I need the word to be defined for me. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance once again deplores the conditions under which Mr Rajoelina came to power in Madagascar. The political situation of that country, which is very unstable, is extremely worrying. There have been numerous human rights violations: violence against demonstrators, illegal arrests, arbitrary detentions, as well as abuses against journalists and political opponents. The security forces enjoy total impunity. Leaders of opposition political movements have been imprisoned. We are demanding their release. In addition, the uncontrolled management of the country’s natural resources threatens prospects for development for future generations and paves the way for an ecological disaster. We condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pillaging of precious wood, particularly rosewood. The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and foremost, the European Union.

 Mr President, these assassinations are, of course, intolerable, but what is more intolerable is the climate of impunity that exists, despite the increase in attacks. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors. Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws. The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally. According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system. The European Union must therefore use all the necessary instruments at its disposal to strengthen judicial cooperation with Pakistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have observed a strange tendency within the European Union: despite statements criticising Israel’s human rights violations, the Member States and the Commission are working tirelessly to strengthen political and economic relations with Israel, with no conditions attached. On 22 February, the Union actually upgraded its association agreement with Israel, promising to step up cooperation in several apparently technical agreements in various areas: competition, access to public contracts, Israel’s integration into the European Research Area and into European agencies such as Europol, the European Space Agency and so on. On 31 January, the Commission authorised the transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to Israel, a country suspected of having used EU citizens’ passports to carry out an extrajudicial killing in Dubai last year. Israel, which already participates in more than 800 projects with European universities and businesses, will receive more than EUR 500 million in subsidies in 2013. Among the beneficiaries will be the arms manufacturers Elbit and Israel Aerospace Industries, which manufacture the drones and aircraft used against the people of Gaza. At the Association Council, the European Union welcomed the new measures announced by Mr Netanyahu for Gaza and the West Bank. Baroness Ashton, please could you indicate what this facilitation measure consists of when hundreds of lorry drivers are protesting in Gaza as we speak to denounce the closure of the Karni crossing? Also, how does Mr Netanyahu propose to stop the rapid colonisation of Jerusalem and the West Bank? I would be grateful, Baroness Ashton, if you could send a message of encouragement and a true message of hope to all those women who took to the streets in Palestine yesterday and who are expecting a great deal of the European Union.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the massacres inflicted on the Coptic Christians in Alexandria provoked international outrage. The Eastern Christians’ situation as a whole is worrying: in Iraq, in Lebanon and even in Palestine, where Christians are leaving what they see as their Holy Land, worn down by the humiliation they have suffered under Israeli occupation. I am glad that our resolution on freedom of religion gives the subject a broad interpretation and recalls the fundamental rights: the right to believe and not to believe; the right to choose a religion without being discriminated against. Whilst our text quite rightly mentions the recent attacks and killings that have gone on in the world, we must also admit that in some European countries, respect for this freedom of religion is under threat. We often witness acts of intolerance: the profaning of Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic talk. Actions such as Switzerland’s vote to ban the construction of minarets and the rise of extremist parties who express intolerant views against certain communities are all signs that we must make the fight to uphold secular principles a priority in Europe. Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and ethnic and religious minorities are all facing a worrying increase in violations of their universal fundamental rights. Europe ought to set an example on tolerance and intercommunity dialogue. Eastern Christians are increasingly suspected of representing the interests and causes of the West, while Muslims in Europe are associated with radical Islam and terrorism. Let me read you if I may two lines of a poem by Louis Aragon: ‘Celui qui croyait au ciel, celui qui n'y croyait pas, et leur sang rouge ruisselle, même couleur, même éclat

 Madam President, Mrs Ashton, may I take this opportunity to thank Mr Arlacchi for the constructive atmosphere in which we have worked. This report offers a very honest, very fair analysis of the shortcomings in the international intervention in Afghanistan since 2001. We approve its key message: there will be no military solution. The war is having a huge cost. The war is costing human lives both amongst the soldiers and the population and it only serves to strengthen the Taliban. The only solution is a political one. What the Afghans are waiting for is real investment in their country’s development, in support for good governance, in the creation of a judicial system. The problem of fundamental rights, most importantly women’s rights, remains intact. The very recent report of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan demonstrates the inability of the Afghan Government to fully safeguard the rights of women and girls. I quote: ‘As long as women and girls are subject to practices that harm them, degrade them and deprive them of their rights, little significant or lasting progress can be made in Afghanistan’. In order to safeguard the rights of Afghan women, not only do we need written legal and constitutional guarantees, but more importantly their rapid and appropriate application. The National Assembly has little influence in the country, the bulk of the power being concentrated in the hands of President Karzai. If it is not too late, unfailing support, to strengthen democracy and the state of law, must come from the European Union to the various institutions and, in particular, to the parliament that has just been elected.

 Madam President, on 8 November, the Moroccan authorities used violence in dismantling the camp set up near Laâyoune, in Western Sahara, resulting in deaths and numerous injuries. I am absolutely outraged that a Member State, in this instance France, should object to the request for a UN fact-finding mission looking into these events. Uganda’s proposal at the UN Security Council meeting on 16 November was however both legitimate and desirable. It is all very well for France to hide behind the lack of decision on the part of the Security Council when it has abused its weight of veto power to prevent any light being shed on these incidents. Would the truth be so hard to face? Europe, which likes to think itself exemplary in protecting human rights, must demand an independent and transparent fact-finding mission, under the aegis of the United Nations, and an extended mandate for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). More generally, we are counting on Baroness Ashton for a fair and lasting solution to be brought to this unacceptable situation for the Sahrawi people. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the Commission wrote in 2005 that, ‘individual expulsion decisions [taken by Member States’ competent authorities] have to comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention, the 1967 Protocol and international treaties. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The fact is, serious human rights violations do take place in Pakistan: the death penalty, torture, death while in custody, forced disappearances, honour crimes. As has already been said, there are several international agreements that it has not signed. How can we be sure that the rights of readmitted individuals and their safety will be protected? There are no guarantees for ethnic or religious minorities or for women. There is no mention of the consequences of the agreement for Afghan refugees, nor are there any plans for the implementation of the agreement to be monitored by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights. In the name of human rights and human dignity, Parliament must reject this agreement. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some people are saying that today’s debate is no longer topical. However, while pressure groups have been attacking European funding for Israeli NGOs since 2005, the working conditions of civil society in Israel continue to deteriorate. Since the publication of the Goldstone report, many representatives of organisations have been defamed, intimidated and arrested. Fourteen draft bills are currently under discussion. They all have the aim of restricting independence and freedom of association. I would remind you that Israeli defenders of human rights are no longer allowed to enter the occupied territories without a permit from the army. Israeli democrats and pacifists, who have been able to benefit from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, are concerned, because even in an amended form, this draft bill specifically targets the financing of international organisations while private funding is not affected. We will no longer accept that those people who have the courage to denounce the daily humiliations suffered by Palestinians, the expulsion of families, demolition of houses, land confiscation and water deprivation, should be reduced to silence.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to start by paying tribute to the coalition of ecologists that we welcomed some months ago in Brussels, an association of Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians. It drew up some excellent reports on the situation in the region, on the state of the Jordan River, and on the risk of its disappearance. The European Union, which allocates substantial funds to development projects in the Middle East, must play more of a role in drafting and implementing a rescue plan for the river involving all parties in the region. The countries bordering the river, such as Syria, Jordan and Israel, divert the greatest part of it, while the Palestinians – as someone just said – receive only around 5% of the resource. In the Jordan Valley, the Israeli settlers consume six times more water than the Palestinians, particularly through the polluting intensive agriculture intended for the export of agricultural products to Europe. The extension of these settlements with their lush vegetation must stop, as must the destruction of Bedouin camps and their water tanks, which happened again this summer, some weeks ago. It is madness! The preservation and fair distribution of water in the region must be a priority for us. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, the case of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, which obviously brings us together this evening, and which has mobilised many citizens in Europe, should also provide us with an opportunity to discuss the situation of a number of women. I am thinking in particular of Zahra Bahrami, who is in the same situation. She is in danger of being executed following a trial that took place in similar conditions, that is to say, that she was subjected to pressure, isolation – total isolation – for several months, violence and torture in order to make confessions that subsequently, of course, are no longer recognised. The accusations are similar: waging war against God. She does not have access to either a lawyer or a defence counsel. There is also the case mentioned just now of the young man, Ebrahim Hamidi, a minor who also has no lawyer, and the case of Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist and human rights defender. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience, and she is currently locked up in a cage in which she cannot move her arms or legs. She is also threatened with death. I believe that it is to the credit of our Parliament that it is rallying in support of Mrs Mohammadi-Ashtiani’s case and of all these situations. We demand the abolition of the death penalty, a moratorium on all these executions, the immediate release of all those who have taken part in peaceful protests and, of course, the release of minors, because many minors are also sentenced to death in that country. We also urgently call for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit the prisoners. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Mrs Parvanova’s report on the social integration of women belonging to ethnic minority groups comes at just the right time, when the French Government is embarking on a huge operation to expel Roma men, women and children – the most disadvantaged and most discriminated-against citizens of Europe. Roma women are the victims of double discrimination because of their origin and their gender. They are discriminated against with regard to the exercise of the fundamental rights that are the right to education, to employment and to healthcare. The violence they suffer as women constitutes another form of discrimination. We must demand that all Member States respect the fundamental rights of the largest ethnic minority in Europe and, first and foremost, of these women. Forced labour, trafficking, forced sterilisation, child marriage and countless abortions characterise the lives of these women, and hounding them from town to town, moving them from one end of Europe to the other, will not improve their situation. It is the duty of every Member State, including France, to guarantee the protection of these women and to guarantee the education of Roma children, both boys and girls. This is the key to their freedom and to their independence. To be free and independent, they need stability and support; expulsions are unacceptable. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Madam President, freedom of religion is not guaranteed in Pakistan. In 2009, an increase in violent attacks against religious minorities has been observed, and that includes murders. In addition, nearly 80% of people from minority groups live below the poverty line. However, this is not the only problem with regard to the violation of human rights in Pakistan: other issues include a restriction on freedom of assembly, threats against civil society organisations, the arrest of trade unionists, kidnappings and the murder of journalists. Since Pakistan declared its support for the war against terrorism waged by the United States, hundreds, if not thousands, of people suspected of having links with terrorist groups have been arbitrarily detained: arrests without warrant, detentions with no legal basis or access to a lawyer, detentions in unspecified locations, forced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture. In the only prison in Lahore, 4 651 prisoners were held in 2009, while the prison has a capacity of only 1 050 prisoners. Violence against women continues to increase: rapes, suicides, acid attacks and women being burned. I would need not two minutes or two hours but two whole days to describe the ordeal suffered by young girls and women in Pakistan. It is within this context that this House, which is concerned about respect for women, freedom of conscience and human rights, is preparing to use its new power of veto for the conclusion of a readmission agreement between the European Union and Pakistan, thus demanding additional guarantees on the conditions for the implementation of such an agreement on the readmission of Pakistani nationals and Afghans who have transited through Pakistan.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would also like to echo the condolences that were just expressed by our fellow Members. We support wholeheartedly the resolution on the mass atrocities in Nigeria, which unfortunately represent only one aspect of the bleak human rights picture in that country. I would like, in the time I have been allotted, to speak about Nigeria’s prisons, which are full of prisoners whose rights are systematically violated. As a 2008 report by Amnesty International revealed, 65% of the prisoners in that country have never been found guilty of any crime. Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years. The problems are such that Nigeria has no choice but to recognise them and to promise to reform the system. We are still waiting for this reform. I am focusing my speech on the prisons because the current situation has once again reminded us of just how little value is put on the life of a human being in Nigeria, and even more so in the prisons. The National Economic Council of Nigeria has announced its plan to execute hundreds of death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in the prisons: killing to reduce prison overpopulation. There is nothing more shocking, especially when it is certain that many of these death-row inmates are innocent and the majority of them did not have the right to a fair trial, and particularly as in February 2009 the Nigerian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs declared before the UN that his country was applying a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. This is why, during the vote, I will table an oral amendment to denounce this recent move by several Nigerian governors. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as I indicated during the debate, I propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6: ‘Calls on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons, which would constitute a gross violation of human rights; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to Nigeria’s commitments at international level’.

Mr President, the resolution on Corporal Gilad Shalit, which we are examining today, supplements the many resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament on the human rights situation in the Middle East. Corporal Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage for 1 355 days, must be released as soon as possible. We demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released. The young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who has been detained by the Israeli authorities since 13 March 2005, must be released. The children imprisoned in Israel, in violation of the provisions of international law and the conventions on the rights of the child, must be released. The militants of the Non­Violent Popular Resistance Against the Occupation, such as Abdallah Abu Rahmah from Bil’in, must be released. The elected representatives, the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council – including Marwan Barghouti – must be released. It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East. The solutions do not lie in one­upmanship, exercised under repressive and violent conditions, an example of which was the assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai, which we condemn, not least because it makes securing the release of Gilad Shalit even more difficult.

 Mr President, the Roma issue is being keenly felt in my region, the west of France. In Nantes, over 1 000 Roma are being expelled from one place after another due to a lack of government regulated sites in which to accommodate them. The few municipalities with facilities to accommodate the Roma, for example, Rezé and Indre, located in the Nantes conurbation, are stretched to the limit and lack the support of the public authorities. The most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties. Responses cannot be local. They must be global. Inclusion of the Roma must be incorporated in every European Union policy in order to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these European citizens. I would also like to draw attention to the specific situation of the women. The problems faced by Roma women are particularly striking, for example, in relation to marital violence or unwanted pregnancies. In France then, according to Médecins du monde
, one in two Roma women, or 43% of that group, will have had an abortion by the age of 22. The average age for the first pregnancy is 17. Only 10% of Roma women use contraception. The European Union must therefore include the gender perspective in all studies and laws that concern the Roma. Education must be a major priority. We must act urgently with the Roma communities to make them aware of their fundamental rights and to facilitate their access to public services. I hope that, at the second European summit on Roma inclusion, the European Union will show its determination to deal with the Roma issue in a comprehensive fashion. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, our debate today is motivated by three aspects concerning the generalised system of tariff preferences. First, the current regulation expires on 31 December 2011. To allow the European Parliament to exercise the powers it possesses under the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission must give us a new draft regulation by June 2010 at the latest. Secondly, the way the Generalised System of Preferences+ (GSP+) operates is anything but perfect. Who decides the list of beneficiary countries and on the basis of which criteria? Amazing! Who actually monitors the implementation of the 27 international conventions on social and environmental issues that are a requirement for becoming a beneficiary of the GSP+? We do not know. What results has the GSP+ shown? Has it resulted in sustainable development, the diversification of production and the creation of respectable employment, or rather in the proliferation of short­term contracts, an increase in the number of abandoned farms and the concentration of large holdings dedicated to export? We have no idea. Therefore, a thorough reform of the regulation is required to guarantee democratic control and to ensure that the measures taken do indeed achieve the desired objectives. However, the real reason for the debate this evening is the regrettable case of Colombia. Until today, the Commission has refused to launch an investigation into the very serious human rights violations in that country. Such an investigation is, however, provided for in the regulation. It is inconceivable, given the values advocated by the European Union, that, in seeking profits in the dairy, automotive, pharmaceuticals, telecoms and banking sector for our own multinationals, the EU should abandon GSP conditionality and, in the past few days, rush into a free trade agreement with Colombia. This is a fatal blow to Colombia’s trade unions, small farmers and consumers and to its national industrial production. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, the London Conference on Afghanistan has led to panic sweeping through the heart of Afghan society, and women are particularly afraid. The peace plan agreed on by 70 countries includes a fund to help reintegrate the Taliban and a Loya Jirga – peace council – must take place within the coming months in order for this reconciliation to be put into effect. Women do not want to and must not pay the price for this reconciliation. The Taliban are still demanding the suppression of women’s rights and the return of Sharia. It is to be feared that the Loya Jirga will modify the Constitution and that the articles protecting women’s rights will disappear; in particular, Article 22 of Chapter 2. Today, 8 March 2010, I solemnly request that the European Union act as guarantor of the future of Afghanistan’s women, as the re-emergence of the most femicidal regime in history cannot be countenanced. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, in Israel, Judge Goldstone’s work is demonised and completely discredited in the eyes of the public. At the same time, a violent smear campaign is being conducted against human rights defenders, notably the New Israel Fund, a foundation which funds the main Israeli organisations for the defence of human rights and, in particular, against its president, Naomi Chazan, a former Member of the Knesset, an academic and intellectual known for her commitment to the defence of women’s rights and peace. Thirteen pacifist groups, such as Bethlehem and Breaking the Silence, are the victims of a veritable witch-hunt. The European Union must provide unfailing support to human rights defenders in all countries including, of course, Israel, whose impunity is an insult to democratic values. The European Union must protect Israel from its own demons. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Back in 2006, the UN acknowledged that the most vulnerable populations and the poorest populations were the main victims of climate change. The fact is, women form the majority in both categories. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, although women are already discriminated against in terms of access to and control of land, the increasing scarcity of cultivable soil due to drought reduces their means of existence even further. A recent report forecasts that in 2050, a billion people will have fled from hostile environments. The loss of security of these climate migrants, forced to take refuge in makeshift camps, raises the level of threat against women. However, we have to admit that in the last 15 years, not one European legislative text on the environment has included the aspect of gender. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I therefore call on the European Union and its Member States to integrate the perspective of equality between women and men in all impact assessments, legislation and policies regarding the environment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is being threatened with strangulation. Subjected to a strict Israeli blockade since 2007, in 2009, Gaza’s population suffered the bloody attack that prompted the Goldstone Report, which was damning for the Israeli military authorities accused of war crimes. Today, it is the Egyptian authorities that have set about building an underground metal barrier in order to prevent any supplies getting through the tunnels. When will there be a stop to this collective punishment imposed on men, women and children, whose suffering is being manipulated on a political stage from a different era? The European Union must act. The European Union has all the trumps as Israel’s main economic partner and the principal contributor of aid to the Palestinian Territories. The Israeli Government will only accept a change of policy under pressure from the international community. The EU can play a decisive role in the resumption of the peace process and in the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state within the borders established in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Madam President, yes, we will have to emerge from the Afghan trap into which we fell because of the policy pursued by George Bush. However, the question is not when, but how, we pull out of Afghanistan. If the countless mistakes made by the international community are not called into question, we are in danger of completely losing the confidence and support of the Afghan population, for the benefit of the Taliban. The militarisation of humanitarian aid and development aid must stop because it is creating confusion in people’s minds and discrediting the NGOs. We must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the Afghan reformists. Why is Europe in Afghanistan? Because the United States said so, or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence? We need to strengthen the most effective Afghan structures, to prioritise investment in public services – education, health and transport – and to support good governance of local powers, since the culture of these countries requires us to reflect on the relevance of the nation state. Europe should, for instance, support Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan Province. Her appointment is a first in the history of this country where, you will recall, we went in 2001 to help the female population. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 – (FR) 
Mr President, the 2000s have been characterised in Europe by a proliferation of security laws: surveillance, repression, detention and imprisonment. Budgets linked to these policies have exploded. Yet violence against women is not in decline. It follows that, in 2008, 156 women died from injuries inflicted by their spouse in France, where almost one in ten women is a victim of marital violence. The security measures implemented for video surveillance, filing or biometrics do not meet the real security needs of women. This violence affects all women in all countries, whatever their origin, social background or religion. It is linked to discrimination based on gender. Sexism, just like racism, consists in denying another person an alter ego status. How do we combat sexism? What we require is strong political will to inform, prevent and protect, the political will to abolish all forms of discrimination in which violence takes root. Is not the safety of more than half of all European citizens, in other words female citizens, worth a substantial political investment? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have rightly spoken about tax evasion. You know that this struggle is extremely important for us, because it is a struggle that revolves around economic efficiency and social justice. Talking about these matters is all very well, but we would like to see action. Where are the Commission’s statements? Where is the pressure from the Commission to help Greece to try to recover the EUR 100 to 200 billion that are in Switzerland, according to the Greek Government’s estimates? I know that this is not necessarily Greece’s priority. Greece holds the primary responsibility for this inability to genuinely levy tax. All the same, where is the action by the Commission to exert pressure on Switzerland, so that the money can be taxed and then return to Greece? Just now, Daniel Cohn-Bendit was talking about what President Obama did in relation to the Swiss banks and banking secrecy. Where is the initiative by the European Commission to do exactly what Mr Obama did, namely, to impose an extra-territorial law that is binding and eliminates banking secrecy? Where is the Commission’s initiative to have a European list of tax havens? On the OECD’s blacklist, there is one state, or two states, or, from time to time, three states; they sign mutual conventions, and then there is no one left on the list. All of a sudden, the struggle is empty, because the blacklist is empty. Where is the Commission’s initiative? I want to see concrete answers, because it is all very well to make these grand declarations before Parliament, but it is actually much better to take tangible political action to put pressure on these states. I am fully aware that these states constitute the main obstacle to progress. We need you, however, to put pressure on the states. Mr Barroso, I would like to put a final question to you, not about tax havens, but about austerity. When we have informal discussions with your departments and those of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, this is what your officials tell us. When you put all the austerity policies and the requirements that have now been imposed by the Commission to reduce budget deficits into the same economic model, it is not possible to show that there is truly a path that will enable us to reduce the deficits. In fact, growth is being damaged to such a degree, and tax revenue is being decreased to such an extent, that the end result is a greater deficit, not a lower one. That is the case, for example, in Spain. The debate is also a live issue in the Netherlands, and perhaps soon will be in France too. Mr Barroso, the reality is that when you use these figures, it does not work. When are you going to admit this? When are you going to change direction? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Ms Kroes, in your speech on behalf of the Commission you said: ‘Eurobonds without fiscal consolidation will not work’. You are quite right. However, what we have today is fiscal consolidation without Eurobonds. What we are proposing here in Parliament is a balance between the two. The package you are proposing today is unbalanced. These are not our words. Listen to the rating agencies. When Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded France a few weeks ago, what it was saying was: ‘Austerity alone does not work’. You do not have to believe me, you do not have to believe the left here in the European Parliament, but you can believe the rating agencies, if you listen more closely to them. The challenge is to put in place today a roadmap because we do not underestimate the legal challenges and technical complexities. It is precisely because it is complicated, however, that we need to start immediately in order to send a message and prepare for the battle as quickly as possible. Over and above the technical and legal issues, there is also the political dimension. In Europe today do we want to do what the United States did 220 years ago, which was to pool, gradually, its public debt as a sign of solidarity and a reflection of a political will to create a political union? I believe that a majority of this House would wish to move in that direction. Surprise us in the European Commission! For once, be truly European and ambitious! Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, there are two democratic institutions in Europe: the Council, which represents the Heads of State or Government, who have been elected, and the European Parliament, which is elected by universal suffrage. For two years, the Council has had sole responsibility for resolving the crisis, and for two years, it has failed. It has failed every quarter by holding another last-chance summit. I will see you in another three months at the next last-chance summit, because last week’s summit completely failed to resolve the issues that were on the table. When you listen to the rating agencies – the infamous financial markets that you are keen to reassure – what do they say? They do not say, ‘more austerity, more discipline’. They say, ‘a comprehensive package including budgetary discipline’. No one is disputing the fact that we need to adopt this approach, but it is just one aspect of the package, not the only one. We are well aware that, today, with this package, with the outcome of this summit, you have added to the citizens’ concerns without even reassuring the markets. In other words, it is a complete waste of time. I shall see you again in three months’ time! However, there is a second European institution that is democratic, namely the European Parliament. As Mr Schulz, Mr Daul and Ms Harms said, it is our responsibility to recognise today that we need to take the lead in establishing an alternative crisis plan, one that offers a different approach from that of the Council, which is all about failure. It is our responsibility not just to vote on a resolution, but to use all the powers bestowed on us by the Treaties to their full extent, to shoulder our responsibilities and to be capable, between us, of reaching compromises. If we prove incapable of reaching compromises between us, then, at that point, we will no longer have the legitimacy to criticise others who are incapable of reaching them. However, we have three months to get there. We have a responsibility to do so; the people of Europe are watching us. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, the report we are voting on today concludes a year’s work and is the first time that the European Union will ban a financial product used to speculate on the debt of states. This report shows clearly that we have the political will to work together in this European Parliament and that we are capable of ensuring that our voices are heard, capable of negotiating, and capable of bringing the states round to our point of view. We in the European Parliament were the only ones to defend this idea of banning uncovered credit default swaps and types of speculation on sovereign debt – the Commission was against the idea – and, in the end, we have won the battle. I therefore urge you to vote in favour of this text. I am very pleased with it and I would like to thank very sincerely the European Parliament negotiators, especially Markus Ferber and Robert Goebbels, who helped me in these negotiations. (Applause) Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, in your speech you talked about peer pressure and market forces, but I think you forgot to mention people pressure because, when I look at the plan that you adopted yesterday evening, I see that you are applying the same approach to Italy as you are to Greece. This is an unpleasant approach and it does not work. If you want to increase the problems we already have in Greece by applying the same approach to Italy tomorrow, please feel free to do so, but I am sure that people pressure will change the landscape. You have not mentioned the word ‘tax’ at all. Several MEPs have mentioned in this House that tax evasion was a major problem in Europe. Our region has the greatest fiscal competition in the world. We are a single market but we do not have fiscal harmonisation. We simply must resolve this paradoxical situation. You know the figures. In Italy, according to the government, EUR 120 billion escape the Italian tax system, EUR 200 billion in Greece, EUR 100 billion in France and EUR 150 billion in Germany. There is no point in calling on casual workers, the unemployed, junior civil servants and the retired to make a contribution if you do not make it a priority to tackle tax evasion. You have not said a single word about this. This is an outrageous and unjust shortcoming in the outcome of yesterday’s summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, President Barroso, I would like to ask you a question. If it is no trouble to you, would you mind listening to it? I am not going to make a long speech. My question is a specific one: do you know how much Greek money – according to the Greek Government itself – is deposited in Switzerland and escaping Greek taxation? EUR 200 billion, which is the equivalent of Greece’s annual GDP and of two-thirds of Greece’s debt. I am still waiting for your initiative to impose taxation on this money which has escaped the Greek tax system. I am also waiting for a strong initiative on this matter from Greece’s socialist government. It would have no macroeconomic impact on Greece, since this money has already gone elsewhere, but this policy would be completely legitimate from a social point of view. However, in order to take this initiative, the Greek Government needs the EU. You will argue that this is complicated, but there is a very simple example: the United States, which is fighting a daily battle to have Swiss banking secrecy lifted for its own citizens and which is winning that battle. Meanwhile, we are either doing nothing, or doing things in an utterly disorganised and counterproductive manner, as the UK and Germany have just done by signing an agreement with Switzerland limiting the EU’s scope for action. It is up to you to take an initiative: EUR 200 billion is a very large sum. We cannot ask European taxpayers to show solidarity if rich Greek citizens do not show any either. Pascal Canfin

 Mr President, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, Mr Rehn, you have focused your comments in this debate on economic governance, that is to say, on the package of six directives that are currently being negotiated. The specific purpose of this report is to integrate this work but, also, to go beyond it. It also aims to indicate a path, a vision that goes beyond the very short-term discussions in which you are rightly involved. However, do take the time to read this report because it outlines a majority view. It is not just the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is a vision that results from a compromise, a compromise reached by a majority. Examining its contents provides a breath of fresh air with regard to the current situation. What is the issue at stake today? The issue is working out who will be paying for the crisis, who will be paying for these 20 percentage points of public debt, accumulated over three years, to save the markets, the banks, and Europe from a very significant recession. By continuing to focus on the issue of public finances, you are targeting the fire-fighter rather than the arsonist. If the Member States have spent 20 points of their Gross Domestic Product in additional debt, it was not for the pleasure of doing so, but because they had no other choice. In solely considering the consequences and limiting yourselves to a European policy focusing on managing the consequences of this crisis, and not the causes, I think you are missing the point and you are causing pro-European opinion among Europeans to become significantly weaker. We know that today, we are threatened by this trend and this isolationism. The second major issue which this report seeks to address concerns the balance of power between the Member States and the markets. We created the euro, in part, to prevent the markets from speculating on our currencies. That is what we saw in the 1990s. Currently, we are at the point at which we must prevent the markets from speculating on our public debts and, in order to do so, we have two tools available to us. The first is Eurobonds, which would involve mutualising our debt to ensure a deep liquid market, such that it is no longer possible to speculate against the single public debt market. The function of the second tool is to limit the capacity of the financial markets to speculate on public debt through a number of instruments. This is the path that a majority in Parliament is ready to propose to you. Seize this opportunity, President-in-Office, on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission.

Mr President, I wanted to propose submitting the report on the legislative proposal to the scrutiny of this House, for the same reasons that we did so regarding the report on derivatives. We have already had four negotiation meetings with the Council. We are now sending a very strong political message, but we are not voting at first reading in order that we can continue the discussions and negotiations in a very practical manner starting next week or in September. I would therefore like to request a report concerning the vote on the legislative proposal. Pascal Canfin,

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the positive atmosphere he has created in the debates we have been able to have. They have resulted in an ambitious and responsible text on which there is very broad agreement in Parliament. I would also like to emphasise two points on which we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, presented proposals, and which were subsequently taken up by all the political groups that supported this text. The first point concerns harmonisation by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the rules on collateral-related competition between clearing houses. We know that one of the great dangers of this text is that risks will be concentrated in clearing houses when they were previously spread around. They will be concentrated in clearing houses, which actually compete with each other by reducing the level of security within the system. No provision was made in the initial Commission proposal to prevent clearing houses competing on the level of security, an important criterion of which is the level of collateral. The second point that I wished to emphasise is our proposal to expand Parliament’s text; we have removed the threshold set by the Commission which limited the transmission of information – the reporting of trading information – because not all derivatives will be traded in clearing houses. We have therefore made provision for all information, be it on over-the-counter trading or on trading carried out in clearing houses, to be transmitted to the regulator so that he has an overview of the risks that exist. I hope that the Council will be receptive to this important development of Parliament’s text. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this report concerns short selling and the supervision of credit default swaps, those products that insure debt against default, in particular state default. The origins of this text lie in the Greek crisis, which began in spring 2010. Following certain movements on the financial markets that had been observed, a political request was put to Commissioner Barnier and to the European Commission to establish European rules on short selling and on sovereign debt speculation tools. The Commission drafted that regulation in September. This was followed by the adoption of our position in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March, and of the Council position in May. Since then we have been negotiating, because we have already had five trialogues, which have enabled us to reach a number of possible compromises. Although they are not here, I should like to thank the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who took part in these trialogues and helped to move this matter forward. However, after those four or five negotiating sessions, we and the shadow rapporteurs who voted by a majority for this text in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in other words, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which I represent – took the decision to vote in the July part-session for this text, but not for the legislative proposal, in order to send two messages. The first message consists in saying that we want to carry on negotiating with the Council because it has been almost a year since the Commission tabled this text and because, on this issue as on others, Parliament wishes to adopt a responsible yet ambitious attitude. We want these texts; we want the rules on financial markets to change. Too often, we have to wait for the Council, which clearly takes much longer to make its decisions than we do. Therefore, we want to carry on negotiating, which means that we will not be voting for the legislative proposal tomorrow. However, we also want to send three messages on the substance in order to reaffirm the positions adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which will become the positions of the European Parliament too when it adopts them – by a very large majority, I think – tomorrow. The first issue concerns the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). In our version we have strengthened the role of ESMA, and you have reminded us many times, Commissioner, of the importance of that institution when it comes to ensuring the consistency of the single-market rules on financial services. I have to say that the position adopted in the Council – to have a red line that is an absolute red line for us, to create a right of veto for States on European regulatory issues concerning sovereign debt – is completely unacceptable. The second point that I wished to raise is that we in Parliament want a simple rule: when you sell an asset, be it a share or a bond, you must be able to know for certain where to find it; there must be an agreement with the person who is going to lend it to you. This is what is known as the ‘hard locate’ rule in technical speak. This is Parliament’s position, and I think it is a sensible one. The final point that I should like to emphasise, and which is obviously a key element of the discussions we are having, is the ban on naked credit default swaps. This position is shared by a large majority of the European Parliament. We do not see how it is possible, in financial terms, to cover oneself against a risk with a credit default swap without being liable for that risk, in other words without owning the bond of the country that issued the security. It is a nonsense and it opens the door to speculation. To conclude, I would say that the current debates on Greece prove us right, because some of the arguments made to limit the Greek restructuring consist in saying, ‘Yes, but some people have speculated. If the debt is restructured, they are going to make money without having invested in Greece.’ That is exactly what we want to put a stop to. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, I just wanted to say something to my fellow Member, Mr Kamall − since he is one of the negotiators of this text and is very familiar with it, and if he is not, he only has to read it – concerning his argument that credit default swaps (CDSs) are used as proxy hedges and therefore should not be banned. As the text says, when CDSs are used for proxy hedging, they are not uncovered. It would be helpful, therefore, if you could change your argument or read the text, because we are debating for nothing otherwise. (Applause)
 The second point that I wished to make is that we really want to complete this text because we feel that the situation is urgent. No one is saying that CDSs caused the Greek crisis. It would be absurd to think that. However, they are clearly being used to fan the flames by financial operators whose sole aim is to exacerbate the crisis so that they can make money at some point. While we are on the subject of CDSs, I should like to tell you that this text only covers the purchase of these swaps. This presents another problem, which was also raised by Mr Kamall, concerning the fact that operators who sell CDSs, such as US banks and hedge funds, are supposed to provide a guarantee against the risk of default to banks such as BNP, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. For those banks, it is a way of getting the risk off their balance sheets. However, those who sell CDSs, such as hedge funds, have a lot less capital than the banks. This tool has the effect of reducing capital requirements and hence the security of the system. Since you are working on the Capital Requirements Directive 4, I should like it if you could also cover the sale of CDSs and the obligations incumbent on sellers of CDSs, rather than just focusing on buyers, as is the case in this text.

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, as you know, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is traditionally very attached to the EIB. We believe that it is an extremely important public policy instrument, and it is because we are very attached to it that we are also very demanding of it – the two go hand in hand. Our view of the EIB is that, ultimately, it is a bank in its own right, and as such, it is subject to bank constraints, which must be taken into account. Several of my fellow Members rightly referred to the fact that the EIB ought perhaps to take account of new constraints linked to the banking sector. At the same time, it is a truly exceptional bank, because it is indeed funded by taxpayers’ money. It is also there to do what the others are not doing, and to adopt rules that go beyond what the private sector can do. I should like to stress one or two points on which I feel that the EIB could do even better, even though progress has been made in recent months. The first point concerns the issue of tax havens. This is an extremely important fight not only for us, but also, I think, for a very large majority of my fellow Members in this House. The crisis showed that tax havens obscure, undermine and weaken the entire financial system and the world economy. Therefore, in this report, the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens. I believe that that practice should be stopped. I am well aware that you have operational constraints on the ground, but there is a political point here, which is that, if you are the power behind Europe, you have to fight battles. If you fight battles, then I think that the battle against tax havens should be one of them. As for us, we would obviously like to go further; in other words, we would like you to attach conditions to EIB loans to businesses that are not part of the entire value chain in tax havens and which are, at the very least, on the OECD’s blacklist, which is currently being revised. The second point that we wished to raise concerns the issue of monitoring and governance. Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now. I believe that we should extend the choice, that we should increase the level of joint accountability so that the choice of projects involving taxpayers’ money is made as democratically and as transparently as possible. The third point is about measuring the benefits of your action. You measure them in financial terms too, of course. As I was saying earlier, you are a bank in your own right, which means that you have challenges to meet in terms of the risk/reward ratio. However, you aim to provide other benefits too, and that is why public money is used. You aim to provide benefits in terms of social cohesion, in terms of the fight against poverty, in terms of environmental protection. I think that you could make still more progress in reporting, in measuring these non-financial benefits, which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy. I think that, rather than setting the financial benefits against the non-financial benefits, you should carry out as broad an assessment as possible, and not limit it to monetary and financial issues alone. Lastly, the final point of my speech will relate to climate change. The report specifically states that you must pursue all the EU’s objectives. One of the official objectives of the European Union is to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue to finance coal-fired power plants, which have a 40-year life span and which emit huge amounts of CO2

I have a very simple answer to that. I believe that the EIB has cost UK taxpayers a lot less than other, completely private UK banks have cost them, and I believe that the general interest, just like that of UK taxpayers, is far better served by the EIB than by other UK banks that the taxpayer has had to bail out. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that many of my fellow Members will have remembered that the background to this package for the Single Market comes from the Monti report, and the Monti report recommended a considerable compromise between those who advocate more competition, if you like, and those who advocate giving more weight to social, environmental and tax-related aspects. I believe that, here in Parliament – and as long as the texts are not unpicked in the votes we shall be having in plenary in a few hours – we have succeeded in finding this compromise, including in the 14 proposals that emerge from the three reports as a whole. I also know that you are having discussions, in the College of Commissioners, to determine which central themes you will be retaining, and we shall clearly be paying great attention to whether this balance found within Parliament and desired by Mr Monti is taken up and extended to the 12 central project themes to which you have referred. I would like to highlight three items which seem particularly important to me, further to what Mrs Turunen said a little while ago on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The first aspect concerns competition. The issue of the Single Market is to ascertain where we can focus competition. Do we focus competition on innovation, on products or do we focus competition on the rules, through environmental dumping or social dumping? I believe we have indeed struck a balance here in Parliament – and I hope you can carry it over into the Commission – which is to say ‘yes’ to more competition through innovation, ‘yes’ to more capital investment, but ‘yes’ also to a social clause, ‘yes’ to environmental standards that ensure that competition does not lead to regulatory dumping. Those are the two aspects that I believe are fundamental to our compromise. The second item that I would like to highlight concerns the tax-related aspects. When you proposed the consolidated corporate tax base for multinational companies in your first version of the Single Market Act, it was not an optional proposal: in other words, all companies had to be subject to this consolidated tax base. In the proposal put out by the Commission 10 days or so ago, it is an optional measure: in other words, instead of building up an aspect of the Single Market, the Commission is tearing one down. You will be adding a new system, you will be adding a layer of complexity, you will be adding regulatory arbitrage instead of creating tax harmonisation. The proposal tabled by the Commission a fortnight ago runs totally counter to what we in Parliament want and to what you had proposed. The last point I want to highlight very quickly is the notion of reciprocity, in exactly the same terms as you have done. The Single Market accounts for 500 million people; it is an economic entity, but it is also a political entity which must afford us more influence in shaping globalisation. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I wanted to clarify why we voted in favour of this Single Market Act. I think it is a step forward. Parliament managed to find the right compromises that do not flush the text of its content but, instead, put real pressure on those who, in the Commission, want the Single Market to continue to adopt a purely free market approach, without including social issues, tax issues or environmental issues. I also merely wanted to clarify that paragraph 54, which deals with public services, services of general interest, is problematic, and we therefore voted against part of this paragraph, which continues to call, ideologically but in veiled terms, for further liberalisation. We argue instead in favour of European public services and securing the European framework, leaving each Member State the option to continue organising public services as they wish, especially at territorial level.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission, and the European Union in particular, to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned. As you know, Brussels is the international lobbying capital, before Washington. There are more lobbyists in Brussels than in Washington, and one of the ways in which they exert their influence on the Commission is through these famous expert groups. I am a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You have, for example, a group of banking experts. Ninety-five per cent of the members of that expert group are bankers, and not just any bankers: only bankers from finance and investment banks, money market banks, and all the major US banks – J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – are represented in it. On the other hand, there are no NGOs or trade unions in that expert group. The idea that the Commission should be advised only by investment bankers, and US investment bankers at that, with regard to changing banking rules seems totally surreal to me after the financial crisis we have gone through. Hence there are some very precise questions and some very precise points in this oral question being put to you: are you going to change the composition of these expert groups? Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided? In the European Parliament, in fact, this is a completely transpartisan issue. There are left-wing MEPs, right-wing MEPs, Green MEPs and liberals who are very interested in these issues. Why were we not involved earlier in the reforms that you have introduced? Pascal Canfin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, in 2006, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the Services Directive, and today, we consider the report assessing the implementation of this Services Directive, previously known as the Bolkestein Directive, to be equally unsatisfactory. The Verts/ALE Group will therefore vote against this report. I should like to make it clear, Mrs Gebhardt, that you did everything you could to achieve the best possible compromises. However, I believe that some red lines have unfortunately been crossed in this report, which means that we cannot vote in favour of it. I should also like to state that you took great care to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I certainly do not wish to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union, either. If France, for example, transposed the Services Directive and chose to include day nurseries in it, when almost all of the other countries chose to do the opposite, it is clearly the responsibility of the French Government and not of the European Union. Therefore, the Verts/ALE Group is certainly not voting against this report in order to criticise the way in which the directive has been transposed in France. It is doing so on account of two key points. The first is that we asked time and again, during the discussions, for the Member States to assess the impact that the initial transposition of the Services Directive had on the quality of jobs and services. Unfortunately, that assessment of the impact on job and service quality could not be integrated into the report. We also called for an assessment of the cost impact for public authorities. Every time we try to take steps to regulate the financial markets, for example, we are told that it will cost a fortune. Here, we have a very high cost for public authorities at a time when budgets are tight, and no one wants to assess it in order to weigh up the pros and cons of the Services Directive. My final point is in the form of a question to Commissioner Barnier. Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain an assurance in this report that the European Commission will finally take note of Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and present a proposal for a directive on public services. Can you tell us when the Commission will finally face up to its responsibilities on this point? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn, I genuinely hope that you will look at the work done by the European Parliament on the subjects we have been dealing with today – the Berès report and the Feio report – because, of course, we are now working as colegislators on economic governance. I can tell you that together with four pro-European groups in Parliament at least, we have made a genuine effort to work on compromises that will achieve something. We have just come from the discussions to try to tie up the problems. Some people are talking about the budget, some are talking about tax measures, and some are talking about governance. What we need today is for the Commission – and it is your role to do this, we are trying to do it and it is your role to do it also – to propose an overall package: something in the spirit of the Monti report that is also along the lines of what Michel Barnier has been trying to do in the context of the internal market. I am waiting for an overall package from Mr Barroso, which should show us how to get ourselves out of the economic crisis. It should not just be about macro-economic governance, but should be along the lines of reading three or four dossiers on macro-economics, tax and the budget and then saying ‘here is the package’. I am sure that if you do that, you will have a very large majority in the European Parliament to support the initiative. If we only look at the issue of public finance, for example, two or three years ago, the Commission and its departments were themselves saying that, of all the countries, Spain was sticking to the Stability and Growth Pact most closely and that Spain’s public finances were in order. The problem is that the instability came from elsewhere and now Spain is in a terrible situation, as is Ireland. We can clearly see that focusing on public finances alone will not help us resolve the crisis. The compromises that we have proposed in the various reports that have been presented today, which will be voted on tomorrow, represent the sum of these issues. They are a way of saying that, yes, we do need to strengthen budgetary discipline. Of course we do. However, to ensure that this budgetary discipline does not lead to social breakdown, but only to public expenditure cuts, we need, at the same time, a European budget package that will finance investment and a tax package that will allow Member States to impose certain taxes. My last question for Mr Rehn, and for Mr Barroso especially, is therefore: are you genuinely in favour of the common corporate tax basis? Do you genuinely support it? It has been shelved by the Commission for 10 years now and for 10 years, you have failed to deal with the matter. It is now time that you did so. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,

 Madam President, Commissioner, my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted. It is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors. I must say that the ability to strictly limit the variable remuneration of directors of banks assisted by the public purse, and even the possibility to defer up to 70% of traders’ bonuses in the long-term interests of the bank and, potentially therefore, to take account of the risks taken and the negative effects of these risks in order to reduce these bonuses, are important rules which translate the G20’s commitments in principle into real figures at European level. However, I must also say that in negotiations with all the other shadow rapporteurs and with the rapporteur herself, we constantly came up against a lack of commitment by the States, against the huge gap between fine rhetoric on the regulation of capitalism, on the raising of the moral standards of capitalism, on the one hand, and the negotiating positions of the Council and the main States, which constantly refused to agree figures, and tried to reduce the scope of and water down all of our ambitious proposals, on the other. I must say, Commissioner, that the Commission has largely been on our side in this struggle. Therefore, I think that this is an achievement which we can share. Now, there is an important issue at stake. As we lost, we have had to make compromises. We lost a number of battles aimed at agreeing figures, and we have had to replace these figures with a number of words, often rather portmanteau words, such as ‘justified’, ‘appropriate’ and ‘balanced’. The challenge now is for the future European banking authority to translate these principles and portmanteau words into real figures, which will then be applied by all banks and all Member States. I would therefore like to know, Mr Barnier, how you intend to apply pressure on and strictly monitor this future process so that it does not distort the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, as you know, there are two ways to reduce deficits. Expenditure can be cut or taxes can be increased. All States can cut expenditure at the same time, although separately, without needing any European coordination. However, to increase taxes and, more specifically, taxes on capital, companies, profits and banks, they do need European coordination. Your communication last week contained absolutely no mention at all of this issue. My question, which is a fairly common one among Members from all groups, is as follows: over the course of the next few weeks, are you going to propose a tax coordination plan to provide Member States with the means of recovering margins for manoeuvre so that they can increase certain taxes, which is something they are unable to do separately? This is the added value which the European Commission can provide at the present time. Unfortunately, you do not have any plans in this area. Mr Verhofstadt was saying that you had a right to take the initiative. In the current situation, you have a duty to take the initiative in this area. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, Mr Barnier, in your speech you mentioned Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted to you a few days ago. There is a very interesting aspect in Mr Monti’s report, and that is the emphasis it places on the pressing need for us to move on to the next stage of fiscal cooperation. It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied, but that if they are applied solely to expenditure, through cuts in expenditure, this will almost certainly lead to a recession. It is therefore crucial to use both pillars and, in particular, the fiscal pillar, to enable the Member States to collect a number of additional receipts from the economic activities and economic operators whose tax burden has been repeatedly reduced over the last few years: the profits from companies, capital, and financial transactions. To do this, we absolutely must have European coordination. This is the conclusion reached in Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted two days ago. However, there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission. There is no mention whatsoever of this issue in Mr Rehn’s communication published a few days ago. This is one of the major pillars, one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time. Do this, and this will establish the link – Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy, the report on the governance of the euro area, on the single market, and employment and education issues. We are well aware that, if we abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact – which, incidentally, is vital – but do so only by cutting expenditure, then we are on course for social regression and economic recession. Therefore, my question is very clear: Mr Barnier, as a representative of the Commission, what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks? How are you going to convince your colleagues – assuming that you are already convinced yourself – of the need for an action plan, for a fiscal coordination plan so that Member States are able once more to raise new revenues on the basis of a number of agreements? What are your proposals? You are not entitled to stay silent. The Commission has a right to initiate legislation, but, today, on these issues, that right has become a duty. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, our public finances are in a situation of crisis and we know that part of the solution may lie in reducing some spending, but that a large part of the solution is in Member States’ ability to raise more funds. The issue at stake, therefore, is knowing what type of tax may be increased, what type of tax must be increased, and what the consequences of these tax increases will be. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance estimates that it would be difficult to significantly raise the taxes paid by small businesses, which create the majority of jobs. It is difficult to increase the taxes paid by families – with the possible exception of those paid by the richest – because in the majority of cases, these are already high enough, particularly in Europe. The question, therefore, is: which taxes should be increased? If taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises are not increased and nor is VAT, other possibilities will inevitably have to be sought. We estimate that a tax on financial transactions is, in the end, the least painful tax for the European economy. It is the tax with the least negative consequences for the global competitiveness of the European economy. Moreover, the cost of financial transactions has diminished enormously over the last ten years or so, both because of a certain number of technical improvements – if they can be called that – and because of European regulation. In fact, these reductions in costs have been entirely absorbed by the financial industry and the banks. It would not be totally unjustified if, by means of a tax on financial transactions, part of the profit saved by the banks from these decreased costs made its way back to the public authorities that saved them. As is always the case, this House is turning this into a very ideological debate, but it is actually quite technical. Transaction costs existed before; they have been reduced. Today, we are proposing that they be increased again in order for public authorities to benefit from these technical improvements and not just private actors. Naturally, the issue of whether the European Union can take this step forward on its own is being raised. It is clear to everyone that it would be better if this were done within an international framework. If others – specifically, the United States – do not follow our lead, the following question arises: is the European Union’s prospect of achieving this then ruled out? Some statements – for example, that of Mr Gauzès – suggest that the Group of the European People’s Party believes that Europe can do nothing on its own. That situation would not, of course, be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent. Does that, however, mean that the European Union should necessarily position itself at the lowest common denominator, that it should have the least possible regulation, and align itself with the least ambitious actor? That does not seem to us to be the sort of thing that will strengthen the European Union’s position of leadership in the world. Furthermore, it is possible to imagine the European Union putting this transaction in place on its own. This is quite simply because the capital flows that concern us start out in the European Union, then may move elsewhere, only to return to the European Union. When these flows leave and return, we have the opportunity to demand that they can be traced, and to know whether or not they have been subject to this tax on financial transactions. If they have, no problem. If they have not, then we can deduct an entry or exit tax. We have done so for years in the real economy with the Common External Tariff. Financial globalisation is now obliging us to do so in the financial sphere of the economy, and it is entirely possible from a technical point of view. What is needed is the political will. Pascal Canfin,

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to tell the Spanish Presidency that we fully support its analysis of the political will to progress towards new tools of governance and towards an economic union, and not just a monetary union, as Mr Bullmann also pointed out. You will have our political group’s full support in this undertaking. In actual fact, leaving aside the Greek case, which is at stake, I believe that we need to review all the tools of economic governance of the euro area and, in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact. More than half of the Member States in the euro area no longer adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, let us not forget that, until fairly recently – until the crisis – Spain was fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, but that did not stop it, two years later, from finding itself in a radically different situation, with a 20% unemployment rate, or from completely disregarding those criteria. What does this mean? It means that, with a Stability and Growth Pact that is narrowly focused on public finance criteria, which are absolutely necessary but insufficient, until recently, Spain controlled its public debt and its public deficit but, at the same time, allowed its private debt to soar. There has been an explosion in private debt, a speculative bubble on the property market, and a recession on a much greater scale than elsewhere, with the result that a massive injection of public money is required. This is indeed proof that, by having a blinkered view of the Stability and Growth Pact and a view of euro area governance that is focused solely on public debt, one fails to see the bigger picture, which would make it possible to anticipate the next crisis and to prevent it. I should therefore like to know what proposals both the Spanish Presidency and the Commission have put on the table in order, of course, to reaffirm the Stability and Growth Pact and, above all, to integrate it into a more comprehensive system. Secondly, you say – and you are right – that public finances need to be controlled better, that a return to more stable debt levels is necessary. In your view, does that depend solely on a decrease in public spending, or does it also depend on the ability to increase certain taxes? If so, which ones? Also, what role can fiscal cooperation between ourselves play in enabling the Member States to regain some room for manoeuvre that will allow them to make up their deficits, not only by reducing expenditure, but also by regaining some room for manoeuvre so as to increase their revenues? Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, in her speech, Mrs Malmström said that action was needed, not just fine words. I can tell you that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will follow the results of this summit between the United States and the European Union very closely, since it comes at a key moment in the path leading us, on the one hand, to Copenhagen and, on the other, to the reform of the international financial system. On this last point, the casino has now reopened, banks’ profits are once again reaching historic levels – USD 437 billion in profits for the US banks – and our view is that there is less political will than there was six months ago. We therefore have enormous expectations of this summit, which is intended to show that, in both the US and Europe, the political will to regulate capitalism and to regulate the financial institutions is still present. In order to achieve this, we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points. The first is combating tax havens, and this is something that was not mentioned in your speeches. The US Treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of USD 100 billion. We therefore wanted to emphasise this point and to tell you that it is important for the United States and Europe to work jointly on this issue at the summit. The second point, which has just been mentioned, is the tax on financial transactions. When Mr Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency, he expressly said that he was in favour of such a tax. A fortnight ago, the European Parliament for the first time voted, by a majority, for a tax on financial transactions, provided that they formed part of an international framework. The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States/European Union Summit in early November. My last point is that on climate, we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr Obama’s foot. President Obama wants to act, but he is blocked by his majority. The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking, at the end of October, to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30% reduction in its own emissions. Once this is done, we will be able to make progress in negotiations. This is our responsibility. We must do it before the summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

− The Verts/ALE Group voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 for several reasons, among which: – by referring to the need to develop new indicators which go beyond GDP, the EP gives a clear signal that ‘economic recovery’ must not be based on a ‘business as usual approach’, which is in line with our request to develop a ‘Green New Deal’; – the resolution insists on the need to tackle global imbalances, especially exchange rate imbalances and commodity price volatility within a multilateral framework; – the resolution sends a good signal towards the setting-up of a tax on financial transactions, which was never the case until now; – as regards the financial crisis, the EP makes a strong statement on international coordination that should aim to avoid regulatory arbitrage. It also stresses that the upgrading of prudential rules within the context of the G20 consists of a ‘minimum harmonisation’ approach that must not prevent the EU from applying higher standards; – as regards supervision of the financial sectors, the EP has made a significant move towards an enhanced and more centralised approach on financial market supervision, with the setting up of a single financial supervisory authority being a final objective.

Mr President, you spoke of the governance of the IMF. I would also like to know if you intend to raise the issue, at the G20, of the conditionality of the money that the IMF lends to states. We have seen that what were previously very liberal conditions have not been changed, and this applies in particular to the loans that were granted to some European States. What is your position on this? My second question is: what is the position of the Commission and the Council on the Chinese proposal to put in place a slightly different international currency, in an effort to regulate the financial system using an alternative to the dollar? My third question is: the G20 is also part of the preparations for Copenhagen. The Commission has proposed a total sum of between EUR 2 and 15 billion to help the countries of the South adapt to climate change. What is the Council’s position? What sum will you put on the table at the G20 next week? Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I have a question for my colleagues about the Polish demand, because I get the impression that this debate is becoming nationalised and that by authorising shale gas exploitation in Poland we are trying to give it European legitimacy. As regards potential, what do you have to say about the figures and the potential that were announced and then the subsequent discovery that there is seven times less potential for exploiting and exploring shale gas in Poland? What do you have to say about subsidiarity, seeing as you are invoking the principle? Does Poland intend to apply subsidiarity to environmental regulations? As it stands today, this falls under European jurisdiction and no country may decide not to apply the regulations. Finally, on the question of acceptance, what answer would you give to the European public, especially those who have lodged complaints with the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go on creating Europe without its citizens. The year 2013 will be the European Year of Citizens. This is good news. There is a lot at stake here, and we shall have to give ourselves the resources to enable us, in the difficult situation which the European Union is experiencing, faced with disaffection and lack of confidence, to turn the European Year of Citizens into Year One of European citizenship in everyday life. Our citizens are the reason for our presence here, and we must send them the message that Parliament and the European Union do not take citizens’ rights lightly, that they are at the heart of all the decisions that we take on a day-to-day basis. We need a campaign which matches the level of what is at stake. Savings in the budget must not be made on this aspect if we do not want the gulf between the Union and its citizens to become even wider. The action programme will have to be ambitious. The tools of participative democracy must be developed and distributed: petitions, access to the Ombudsman, European citizens’ initiatives, citizens’ forums, consultations, etc. I am sorry to say that our citizens fail to appreciate the rights and tools of participative democracy. In 2013, let us put our citizens back into the heart of our institutions and, in so doing, put Europe back into the heart of its Member States. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just got back from Hyderabad, in India, and the Eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity. Parliament was represented there alongside the Commission and the Council. The task facing this summit was an important one: to decide on financing for the biodiversity rescue plan 2010-2020 [sic
: 2011-2020], adopted two years ago at Nagoya. It was a close-run thing; the talks were difficult, but definite progress was made on maritime and coastal waters, and a commitment was secured to double the funding for biodiversity by 2015. After the disappointment of the Rio Summit, this comes as a relief. The European Union and the international community are still capable of imposing their will when it comes to the environment. But the critical state of biodiversity requires us to intensify our efforts and deliver on our commitments to preserve our natural world, here and now, in the budget, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. And soon we shall be debating measures against biopiracy and ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. I urge you to show a solid front and prove, once again, that the European Parliament seeks and feels a responsibility for biojustice at European and world level. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to say how delighted I am that we are having this discussion in this House just a few days after the Earth summit, which, as we have already heard, a number of you attended. It is time, I believe, to take stock and, most of all, to look forward. Taking stock is a simple matter: the results of this summit are disappointing. Forty years after the first Earth summit and 20 years after the commitments made in Rio, while we were expecting renewed impetus, a leap forward, the leaders of the international community were treading water. As to the future we want, the promise has not been kept and the commitments have been carried forward to 2015. The European Union set off for Rio with the ambition of sharing an action programme and we are returning with a work programme. Today, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, as well as the Member States, for the determination they have shown in the negotiations, and for embodying Europe’s ambitions in terms of the ecological transition of our economy, which we defined in this Parliament. Where do we go from here? Now, more than ever before, I am aware of the responsibility resting on our shoulders and the role that the European Union can play in promoting a new model of development to help us recover from the crisis. In Rio, we failed to set an example, and we did not provide any evidence that we were applying and following through with our ambitions in terms of sustainable development in all our European policies. What we now have to do is activate the transition at European level and at the level of the Member States. Without further ado, let us introduce innovative financing and implement the financial transaction tax and the environmental tax. Without further ado, let us initiate our energy transition so as to put an end to fossil fuels. Let us commit to the conservation of our marine and terrestrial resources. Let us get on with it! This will strengthen the credibility of the European Union and give it greater international weight. It will also enhance the prospects of the international human community for a better future. Let us resolutely commit ourselves, once again, right here and now, to the work programme adopted in Rio to accelerate change. Above all, let us also reaffirm our ambitions and try to make headway in the next two meetings in 2012: on biodiversity in Hyderabad and on climate in Doha. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, our Parliament will vote on the ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). It is because this treaty is a threat to public and digital liberties and to fundamental rights (freedom of expression, protection of personal data and private life), but also because it will lead to unacceptable restrictions in terms of information sharing in the fields of culture, agriculture, health and innovation to the benefit of certain groups, that we must reject ACTA. After three years of political and technical sparring, will our Parliament, the one and only direct representative of the European citizens, live up to the expectations and the trust of the thousands of citizens who have protested on the streets of Europe and inundated us with e-mails, the three million Europeans who have appealed to our Committee on Petitions, the citizens who elected us? Yes, by voting against ACTA and in favour of freedoms. Tomorrow, it is the citizens’ lobby which must win in order to say ‘Bye bye ACTA, welcome democracy!’. Welcome European democracy and citizens’ democracy. Welcome to the 21st century and the digital age. Our choice, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is political, and it is a rejection of the world proposed to us by ACTA. Sandrine Bélier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Seeber. This report provides a clear overview of the issues surrounding implementation of water legislation, in particular, and also gives a very good insight into possible solutions, especially in terms of more widely applicable, cohesive policies for this vital resource and its preservation. Among the report’s positive elements, and one that we must address as a matter of urgency, is its reaffirmation that water is a shared resource of humankind and that an integrated approach is needed. It also emphasises the duty of moderation of all sectors and all users in every EU country in their use of water, and calls once again for an objective assessment and urgent review – and perhaps even the phasing out – of all public subsidies and funding that are harmful to the preservation of water quality. I regret the fact that the report does not place enough emphasis on the urgency of reducing urban, industrial and agricultural diffuse pollution by all possible means. We still need to make a greater commitment to protecting aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, through regulatory oversight of our soils, among other things, so that eventually, we will achieve ‘good status’ throughout the European Union, as unfortunately, this will not be achieved by 2015. We have tools that we must develop and harmonise, but above all, we have objectives that we must meet without delay. All we need to do now is to put them into practice. We are counting on the European Commission to make sure this happens. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work. This report proposes a new strategy to 2020 to combat biodiversity loss, the pace of which, as has been pointed out, is continuing to accelerate dangerously. It aims to remind us of the extent to which our systems and our future are intimately linked to the conservation of our natural and genetic capital – for our food, our health and the fight against climate change – and it highlights the extent to which our future economic development is linked to our ability to conserve biodiversity. Let us remind ourselves that, each year, we are losing 3% of global GDP due to biodiversity loss, that the costs of inaction are far higher than the necessary investment costs and are not simply financial and that urgent measures are needed before the cost becomes too high and the loan taken out can no longer be repaid. Our report calls for two immediate measures: the development of innovative financial mechanisms and the elimination of all environmentally harmful public subsidies. However, this report also insists on the need to enshrine our development strategies in a medium and long-term vision and to place the challenges of preserving biodiversity at the heart of our sectoral policies and, first and foremost, at the heart of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the forestry policy. If this dimension of integration and ambitious commitments were to disappear from the text during today’s vote, we would be depriving ourselves of one of the main levers for action, and my group would not be able to vote for this report. Furthermore, I call on my conservative colleagues not to reject the unblocking of the framework directive on soil protection. Today, 48% of European soil is heavily degraded. This degradation has a cost estimated by the Commission at just under EUR 40 billion annually. Only ambitious action taken at European level can save us from this infernal spiral of the artificial development and sterilisation of our land. Finally, it is because we need to learn from our past mistakes and look to the future, and beyond Europe, that we have also introduced a reference to the next Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. Meanwhile, this report is one of the key stages of our determination and of the role of the European Union to succeed where yesterday we failed. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have one minute to call your attention to the ACTA treaty, an international anti-counterfeiting treaty which is not limited to counterfeiting. Patents and online activity are clearly included in the text in unacceptable conditions. Last Saturday, tens of thousands of people protested throughout Europe. More than two million citizens signed a petition against the treaty. Several governments are stepping back — Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia — in the name of defending civil rights. Germany has withheld its decision while it waits to hear the European Parliament’s position. Nineteen Sakharov Prize laureates and several NGOs have expressed their opposition. However, the European Commission is turning a blind eye and trying to force the treaty through. Today, I am launching an appeal to the representatives of the European people from all of the parties within this Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are relying on us to ensure the respect and protection of freedom of expression, freedom of information, access to generic medicines, personal data and details about their private lives, all of which are threatened by this treaty. They are relying on us to defend their freedoms and their fundamental rights and to block ACTA, as it has been presented to us in its current state. We must not disappoint them, we must be demanding and say no, vote against ACTA. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, this European Parliament resolution on the neutrality of the Internet shows our capacity to play a concrete role in the transformation from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. Ensuring that fundamental rights are respected in this new economy is crucial from all points of view. We are therefore delighted with the spirit of this resolution, which considers the Internet as a new area of democracy and which points out the importance of ensuring respect for fundamental rights related to or dependent on the web’s neutrality, such as freedom of expression, the protection of private data and media pluralism. It also highlights the importance of ensuring respect for values such as the sharing of and access to knowledge for the greatest number of people and of allowing no exceptions in the application of legal proceedings that enforce the respect of these rights. We hope that this resolution will lead us towards the recognition and enshrinement of the right to Internet access in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Finally, we also hope that this resolution will find support within the Commission and the Council so as to strengthen the European regulatory framework, and in particular, its application in all of the Member States to truly ensure an open and free Internet for every European citizen.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the context in which preparations are taking place for the fourth Earth Summit is difficult. It is incumbent upon us, of course, to tackle the financial and economic crisis in the euro area. However, one crisis does not chase away another and they are often linked. Indeed, the debt crisis does not affect only Greece and European finances. The crisis is not just financial. It is also a social and ecological crisis, which has to be brought to an end. Today, we are running an ecological deficit. We began to eat into our credit forty years ago and the debt has been growing ever since. Inequalities are getting worse, assaults on mother nature are mounting every year, with imbalances in the weather system, deforestation, collapsing fish stocks and loss of biodiversity being the most flagrant signs. There is only one solution for humanity: it must settle its debt. For this to happen, it behoves the policy makers of this world to act in solidarity, now, in 2012, not in 10 years’ time. I believe that the European Union has a crucial role to play and that the fourth Earth Summit in Rio in June 2012 is the ideal framework for making further commitments, for changing our economic development models, and for moving towards a new green economy. Let us say ‘yes’ to an economy that consumes fewer resources, a fairer economy, an economy that is committed to ecological sustainability and social justice; ‘yes’ to new indicators going beyond GDP; ‘yes’ to the principle of bioconditionality; but ‘no’ to the commoditisation and privatisation of common assets; and ‘no’ to the reproduction of the models that have brought us to where we are today. Let us say ‘yes’ to an international status for environmental refugees; ‘yes to greater responsibility, justice and environmental democracy. We, elected representatives, 20 years later, what do we say to Severn Suzuki? What will our response be if another child stands up in Rio in June 2012 and expresses her fear of the future, her inability to understand the inequalities that exist across the world and implores us to act before it is too late? The resolution we will vote on tomorrow is one of the elements of that response. This resolution, as adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is an ambitious, firm and responsible position, and I call on my fellow Members not to weaken it. I call on the Commission and the Council to give it the scope it deserves at the highest level for sustainable development on a global scale. (Applause) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to consider that the exact and original wording of paragraph 35 of the resolution, which is put to the vote and which stresses that corporate social responsibility should include biodiversity, is the French version, and that that should be the version used. Moreover, the word ‘social’, which has disappeared from the English version, should be reinserted and the version corrected. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, you invited us to vote for the original text of paragraph 16. However, there was a separate vote beforehand, and paragraph 16 was amended. There were two separate votes. Therefore, we voted for the original text but not for the amendment. Sandrine Bélier,

Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitments made in 1992 in Rio and in 2002 in Johannesburg have not been respected. Our strategies for halting the loss of biodiversity have been a failure, and we know the reasons for this failure. The climate is changing, biodiversity is diminishing, and humanity must be determined to adapt itself more and more quickly, and in ways which are more and more difficult. In Nagoya, with a few weeks to go before Cancún, the European Union has the opportunity to argue in favour of adapting our economic development model to face up to the challenges of the 21st century. Climate deregulation, halting the loss of biodiversity and combating poverty: these three challenges, and the responses needed to face up to them, are intimately linked. We have the responsibility of proposing and introducing a new development model which is fairer, more equitable and more sustainable. So let us speak clearly and practically. Parliament’s resolution identifies three key challenges which now raise several questions about the Commission’s and the Council’s position. The first challenge, of course, is to start protecting and restoring biodiversity. This presupposes adequate financing, the withdrawal of all public aid which is harmful for biodiversity and a dedicated budget which we propose should be multiplied tenfold. However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same? The second challenge is the cost of biodiversity loss to society, which has only just begun to be evaluated. It is thought to be around 1% of global GDP, but this evaluation does not take into account the social, cultural, moral and scientific value of biodiversity. Is the European Union determined to resist the monetisation of living things? Is it determined to defend the common inheritance of humankind and to reaffirm that nature is priceless and is not for sale? Finally, the third challenge is to stop the pillaging of genetic resources by businesses and industries. One solution is to regulate access to genetic resources in a way which, in particular, respects fully the rights of indigenous and local communities. The European Union will still have a particular responsibility in these negotiations. As such, is it determined, firstly, to defend the principle of the non-patentability of life and, secondly, to support the repayment of the ecological debt to the countries of the South by supporting the retroactivity of the system which is to be adopted? Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been mentioned, it is the International Year of Biodiversity and, this year, we are being asked to commit ourselves to resolving a triple crisis. The three interconnected elements require a consistent and integrated approach if we are to tackle them and emerge from an ecological crisis that has direct repercussions for our economy and our social model. This triple crisis involves food security, climate change and loss of biodiversity. I should like to remind you that biodiversity has no price attached, but its loss, its decline and its destruction do have a cost which contributes to the increase in poverty and which engenders inequalities and considerable losses in economic, welfare and cultural terms. As has already been mentioned – and we now know it for sure – 40% of our world economy depends directly on services provided by nature, and 60% of these are in sharp decline. Europe has lost 30% of its biodiversity over the past 40 years. This loss is currently valued at 1% of the EU’s GDP – EUR 50 billion per year – and it might reach EUR 14 000 billion in 2050 if we do not take action, since the decline is accelerating and the causes of the failure of previous EU policies in this area are well known and are clearly set out in the report. The measures to be taken are also set out in the report. We are therefore hoping for a large vote in its favour, and we should like to thank Mrs de Lange for her work. We now have to move from words and intentions to deeds; from objectives to means. I find it difficult to hide several regrets: the lack of responsiveness on the part of the Council and of the Commission despite the need for urgent action; the regret that Soil Directive IV is still being blocked by the Council; the regret that bio-conditionality of all public financing was rejected by just one vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; and the regret that the challenges associated with biodiversity have not been more extensively incorporated in the EU 2020 strategy, so as to ensure a sustainable exit from the crisis through the greening of our economic model. There is a need for consistency. There is still time to understand and to commit ourselves to ensuring that our natural capital is preserved and enhanced. This is a winning investment for the future.

Madam President, France is the only Member State that did not anticipate the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and that is refusing to abide by the outcome of the European elections of June 2009. By accepting the third option – the French exception – of appointing two new MEPs, we are being asked to endorse a serious violation of the Union’s primary legislation: the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, from which we have derived our legitimacy for 31 years. Are we going to abide by the Council’s decision, under pressure from one Member State, which shows a certain lack of regard for the Union and the European citizens? Our Parliament must not sanction this serious breach of the principle of European democracy. We must refuse to undermine our legitimacy and our credibility as elected representatives of the European public. It is the European citizens who choose who they want to represent them in the European Parliament, not the governments of the Member States. This French exception justifies our demand for Parliament to be involved, in the case of a convention on the revision of the Treaties, and to reject any intergovernmental conference.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you touched on the subject of storm Xynthia, which has just struck Western Europe causing the deaths of almost 60 people and considerable material damage. I am extremely sad today, but also angry because this human catastrophe could have been avoided; at the least, its impacts could have been limited. Until recently in France and throughout Europe today, coastal areas and flood zones are being developed in spite of and in violation of current European, and indeed national, legislation. These are often Natura 2000 sites, and their protection from urbanisation is essential to limit the effects of similar natural events. It is up to us to demonstrate greater accountability, to make sure that Community regulations – in particular, the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive – are strictly applied by Member States, and to make the Structural Funds conditional on the requirements of sustainability, safety and biodiversity. The EU 2020 strategy is a unique opportunity to redefine our relationship with the environment. (The President cut off the speaker) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

I am sorry, Mr President. This is my first time, I checked that the procedure was correct and meanwhile … please accept my apologies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the year that the UN has declared the ‘International Year of Biodiversity’, I would like to draw your attention to the failure of the 2004-2010 European Strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity. 40% of our natural heritage is under threat. The state of biodiversity is a measure of the state of health of the planet, of the state of health of our development system, and the crisis phenomenon is accelerating. Therefore, I hope that, today and tomorrow, the European Union and the European Parliament will be able to rise to the challenges and come up with ambitious and wide-ranging objectives to halt the loss of biodiversity in all sectoral policies in 2010. We must act, there is still time, and 2010 is a year in which anything is possible. I hope we will be able to do better than we did in Copenhagen. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 November, Parliament was given the Council’s guarantee that any restrictions on internet access can only be made if certain conditions are met: prior, fair and impartial procedure; a guarantee of the principle of presumption of innocence and the respect for privacy; and respect for the European Convention on Human Rights. This agreement is the first step towards better protection for citizens faced with growing attempts made by certain States and private operators to trivialise the principle of flexible response, data storage and the control of digital exchange on the internet. That, however, is not enough. Accepting restrictions on digital freedoms and going against net neutrality is not acceptable. It is contrary to the Lisbon Strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the Union. As the sole directly elected European institution, in order to protect citizens’ interests, Parliament now has the moral and political duty to take up this issue and define the rights and duties of internet users so as to guarantee their digital freedom and access to knowledge. We will vote in favour of this text, but we will make sure that we take the matter further tomorrow. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot address the Presidency, since it is not here. We spend our time, in our constituencies and our countries, defending Europe, saying: ‘There will be no way out of the crisis without Europe!’. Europe is complicated: it is made up of 27 states, soon to be 28, and it is always extremely difficult to come to and implement European decisions quickly. Forgive me, Commissioner, but when I listen to you, I think: ‘I hope workers in the photovoltaic sector are not watching the video of your speech!’, because they are going to say to themselves: ‘Is this the Europe that is supposed to be protecting me?’. For years, we have been told that the fight against climate change, renewable energy objectives, green industry and the green economy would be pillars of European growth and the European economy. Today, what are we seeing? We are seeing European institutions that are, in part, petrified by China, and which are taking months and months to potentially react or take provisional measures. How can we justify to these workers, and to all those who are fighting for Europe to protect industry and protect workers, the fact that the United States have, in the space of a few weeks, taken strong measures, imposing import tariffs of up to 250 %, while in Europe, we finally got around to opening an investigation in September and may have provisional measures by July, or failing that, by the end of the year? It is true that First Solar
 has already closed its sites in Germany; it is true that the news about Q Cells
 is now history. How many small and medium-sized enterprises are in difficulty today, however? Even if they do not make it into the news, they are in difficulty. Thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs are under threat. So, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee, we urge you to accelerate the process of introducing provisional measures. Europe was a leader, with ambitious goals on renewable energy and a strong renewable energy industry working alongside it. Today, we are losing that industry, while a real trade war is taking place between the United States and China in the strategic sector of renewable energy, which is so crucial to our competitiveness and our future energy policy. It seems that today, the European Union has once again opted to wait indefinitely. At this rate, the decision will be taken by default. When there is no European photovoltaic industry left, there will no longer be any point in taking measures: you will be able to rest at ease!

 Thank you, Mr Caspary, for your question, which gives me the opportunity to continue to elaborate on this subject. I find it extremely compelling that the entire Committee on International Trade – which is hardly known for its protectionism – is, through this probing oral question, calling on the Commission to go faster. It is not entirely insignificant that it should be a German coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and a German coordinator of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who are now saying that measures must be taken, while Germany has regularly said: ‘Let us avoid any problems with China, let us avoid any trade war with China!’. The European Parliament is therefore united, Commissioner, in calling on you to accelerate the procedures. We must save these jobs. We must do as China and the United States have done and finally endow ourselves with an industrial policy that defends itself through trade instruments. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, if the world warmed by 4°C we would see a torrent of disasters, including extreme heat waves, a reduction in food stocks and a rise in sea level, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Those words are not taken from the Doha briefing brochure of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, as you know, from the World Bank report, which also states that the fight against global warming is an economic opportunity. However, it seems that the international negotiations are not making any headway and are waiting for 2015. We must obviously avoid what led to the Copenhagen failure: trying to reach an agreement right before the end of Copenhagen and not preparing it adequately beforehand. Doha is an extremely important meeting. It seems that conservatism of all kinds is taking precedence over the urgency and the new economy, especially this new carbon-free economy, so the European Union needs to set an example. Here, once again, the Union seems to be dragging its feet: when it comes to aviation, climate change caused by agrofuels, the restriction on the coal market and ‘hot air’, the European Union’s most recent decisions have been bad decisions. We know that you are ambitious, Commissioner. We need to be ambitious in Doha and we need to continue to try to convince your colleagues in the Commission and us in the European Parliament to ensure that Europe continues to lead the way.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we sometimes see astonishing things in this Parliament. When we talk about human rights in China, we hear people say: ‘we need to do business with China because that will encourage respect for human rights in China’. When revolutions happen in Arab countries, we hear people say: ‘we must organise free trade agreements with the Arab countries because that is how we can support the emergence of democracy in the Arab countries’. All of a sudden, trade becomes a purely technical, and highly complicated, issue that has no connection with politics. We know, unfortunately, that this agreement does not guarantee the origin of the products that will enter the European market: firstly, pharmaceutical products and then other industrial products. Not even a week ago, Mr Netanyahu’s Government announced the legalisation of unauthorised settlements and the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank, and all this with an eye on the election on 22 January. At a time when Europe is going to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of its past and, above all, the history it must build, particularly with its neighbours, it would be an aberration for Europe to send out a message that it is upgrading its political relations with Israel, rewarding the Netanyahu Administration for all of its politics, which are constantly criticised by the EU bodies, especially Baroness Ashton. What we are doing here is sending a message to Israel: ‘you must vote for Mr Netanyahu so that he continues his settlement policy, his policy of infringing human rights’. We are in favour of referring the report back to committee for all of the reasons that Mr Moreira gave. It is crucial that Europe does not get involved in the Israeli elections and does not send a message of support to Mr Netanyahu.

As you know, it is extremely difficult to trace the origin of all of the products that come from Israel. Therefore, even if there is no definitive proof today that pharmaceutical products are produced in certain territories, that does not mean that that will be the case in the future, especially when there is a desire to expand the settlements and there may be other industrial products that would not offer a guarantee that they are not manufactured in the Occupied Territories. Sir, do not hesitate to look at the voting list of the Greens for every vote we hold on trade agreements: you will see that we are consistent with regard to respect for human rights, the environment and social rights.

 Mr President, tomorrow, Parliament should reject the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). This is good news for democracy, because it sanctions a negotiation process which has chosen confidentiality and opacity over transparency and the involvement of Parliament. I know that it is not your fault, Commissioner. This is good news for democracy, because Parliament will choose culture, agriculture, health and communication over large industrial groups. I am shocked to hear that certain Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believe that the general interest is that of large industrial groups and not that of citizens when they become involved in a social issue. This is good news for democracy, because millions of citizens have taken to the streets and have held a large-scale social debate, and I am happy that some MEPs in this Chamber have changed their minds in favour of democracy. Lastly, this is good news for democracy, because we will finally have, within our European societies, a debate on the balance between public freedom and information sharing, on the one hand, and fair remuneration for creativity and innovation, on the other.

Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that someone is taking notes for the Danish Presidency. We also share the positive view on this resolution. It is extremely important for us that the Council be able to hear the voice of Parliament on the mandate. I believe that the institutional agreement framework is clear. It is not a binding opinion but, in view of both the economic and social crises, and the trade deficits that we have in Europe, it is absolutely essential to get trade agreements and the content of the negotiations right. For that reason, should it happen, for once, that the Council listens to what Parliament has to say before establishing the negotiating mandate, I think that we could take a step forward in terms of the quality of the agreements that we can approve. I think that recent experience, including the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), shows that from a policy standpoint, it would be wise to listen to what Parliament has to say before entering into negotiations. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is not a question of obtaining, pre-negotiation, concessions from the Japanese, as certain groups understand it. We are simply saying: let us have a transparent negotiation process that is clear, and thereby not enter into several negotiation processes at the same time. Let us have a clear mandate with which we can start negotiations. That also raises some questions. Conducting negotiations with Japan and with the United States also raises some questions. In our Committee on International Trade, we have, on several occasions, had discussions with Pascal Lamy and today this process marks a break. Entering into negotiations with a large trade bloc such as Japan or the United States marks a break in the European position and, as such, puts to one side, or takes note of, the failed negotiations that took place in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must take greater consideration of the consequences of these negotiations, in particular, when they primarily concern the regulatory system, investments, public markets, and all of the regulatory frameworks rather than tariffs. We must consider what bilateral negotiations signify as opposed to multilateral negotiations. Then, Commissioner, you said that 90%, I believe, of the growth – this is your figure – will take place outside of Europe. I am not sure that Japan is the most dynamic area right now, but to benefit further from this international growth means being able to sell, which entails having a strategic vision of our economy and our industrial sector. Once again, I regret the fact that we have some 20 trade negotiations ongoing around the world without having an industrial policy, without knowing what we want for our economy, for example, for our automotive industry over the next 20 years.

 I have a quick question for Mr Caspary: is it already the case that despite the conditions that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) imposed with regard to concluding an agreement, it has already voted against a free trade agreement? Now a subsidiary question: does Mr Caspary recall a single impact assessment concerning the implementation of a free trade agreement which can confirm all the benefits which were announced when the free trade agreement was negotiated, be they social or economic benefits?

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, it goes without saying that failing to comply with social and environmental standards and human rights also creates an imbalance between the EU and China. However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States. Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries. Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy. In Europe, we try to have both targets for renewable energy and, until recently, a renewable energy industry. China has launched a price war on renewable energy and, in particular, photovoltaics. Through subsidies, it has developed production overcapacity that is killing off the European photovoltaic industry. This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not? Thousands of jobs are currently being lost, which is why we call on the European Commission to come back to Parliament with an analysis of China’s strategy in the photovoltaic market and whether the US response is the right way to go. We clearly want to be thinking along these lines. We cannot be defending our targets for renewable energy without defending the European renewable energy industry. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, you mentioned the European legislation on CO2 
emissions from cars. This was already one of the Commission’s initiatives in 1995. Yet, faced with the lobby by large car manufacturers, what should have been achieved in 2005 will not be achieved until 2015. I would like it if, at some point, democracy were allowed to function and citizens were able to see the transparency of what is being debated in Parliament, because those on the conservative benches who claim to protect the citizens are today abandoning them in the face of rocketing fuel bills. They are abandoning the workers in the face of the relocation of an industry that has failed to innovate and that has left our territories. They are abandoning the citizens of the whole world in the face of climate change. Yes, we find ourselves in a complicated situation. We are facing a twofold problem. Firstly, we have governments that seem incapable of changing their software, incapable of imagining an economic model that is anything other than household debt, State debt or climate debt. Then, we are seeing lobbies in this situation that are stepping into the breach of this conservatism. Nuclear energy, carbon sequestration, oil sands and shale gas lobbyists are trying to take advantage of this political indecision. Ms Hedegaard, your Roadmap is not perfect, Mr Davies’ report is not perfect, but it would be irresponsible of Parliament to validate the complete irresponsibility of Poland. We will vote for this report. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr Helmer, could you confirm that in Great Britain, EDF, E.ON and RWE are in the process of negotiating a feed-in tariff for nuclear energy of nine to 12 cents per kWh, a price that is currently higher than that of onshore wind energy, which is seven cents per kWh? Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you; you managed to avert disaster in Durban. You managed to put across the idea that there is a suitable framework for negotiations but, on the other hand, nothing has actually been triggered to stem climate change. With the notable exception of Poland, you gained the support of Member States to champion these negotiations but you know, unfortunately, you do not have the same consensus from Member States to implement an ambitious climate policy. What I propose, Commissioner, is that DG CLIMA, which you run, makes its contribution to getting Europe out of the crisis, by explaining how an ambitious climate policy could significantly help us get out of the crisis through energy efficiency, through energy savings, through renewable energy, through innovation in technology. Maybe then we would have a document which would allow us to fight – us in the Member States, you at European level –so that the old economy loosens its grip on our political leaders and the new economy may finally emerge.

 Mr President, it is very good of you to give me the floor. I had not planned to speak. I should just like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the teams who worked on this issue.

 Madam President, Commissioner, some of us were in Doha when we launched the Doha Round. We are well aware that the Round was, in a way, stillborn: it had so many contradictions in its genes that it could not succeed, but it was the international situation – it was just after 11 September – that ultimately forced all the countries to sign in Doha. What we are seeing above all today is not a crisis of confidence within the international community, but a crisis of globalisation. We need to stop thinking about ever more liberalisation and focus instead, of course, on regulation, in a world in which every one of us today can see the damage caused by the globalisation of trade, whether it be from an environmental point of view or from a social point of view. What kind of economy does Europe want to create for itself? How can we put a stop to environmental, social, fiscal and monetary dumping? How can we ensure that people can exercise their trade union freedom throughout the world without restriction? How can Europe make global trade dependent on the recognition and exercise of trade union freedom? These are the questions that we need to be asking ourselves today, that Europe needs to ask itself when it operates within a multilateral framework. We must acknowledge that the Doha Round is finished, adopt a package that is limited and restricted to the least developed countries and, above all, launch an ambitious and transparent process for reforming the World Trade Organisation, one that guarantees the fair participation of all stakeholders and safeguards the interests of the weakest countries in particular, that makes trade law subject to social legislation, environmental law and, of course, human rights, and that actually promotes a multilateral regulatory agenda that puts globalisation back where it belongs.

Madam President, Commissioner, you are not being attacked personally in this matter, Commissioner, but you must understand that we are extremely disappointed that the Commission has given in so easily to pressure from some Member States, and France in particular. So we do indeed want to phase out nuclear power because we believe that this is the only way to eliminate the nuclear risk. In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years. We want to have real tests, and we cannot accept the fact that France has been successful in allowing the risky option to go forward. The tests do not predict airplane crashes, either over fuel ponds or over reactors. Neither do they predict terrorist attacks. We refuse to accept the fact that the tests applied at European level have become a communications exercise by a crisis unit for the nuclear industry, which Mr Sarkozy will showcase at the next G8 in order to sell even more European pressurised water reactors (PWRs). That is what we cannot accept, Commissioner. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Indeed, Mr Liese, this resolution was co-signed, and I would also like to respond to Mrs del Castillo Vera who said that the French public is in favour of nuclear energy. That is not true. All the surveys show that 77% of French people want to move away from nuclear energy, but in France we cannot have that debate. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact the first major Free Trade Agreement that Europe has passed for some years, and when it comes to free trade agreements, it must be said that you do not lack ambition – South Korea, Canada, India, Mercosur. There is not a single country or area that escapes the European Commission’s ambitions where free trade agreements are concerned. In the case of this agreement, we have seen that there will only be winners, but I still wonder who the winners will be when I am told that they will be in the agricultural sector. As the elected representative of Brittany, I can tell you that in in that region which produces more than 60% of French pigmeat, the few benefits to be had by the agri-food product firms do not compensate for reductions in tourism, degradation of the environment and the health of workers, and farmers’ losses. There are, indeed, also a great number of losers, and do we, here, have a vision of what economic and social Europe will be like after all these free trade agreements have been signed? No we do not, and nor do we know, at the end of the day, whether there will be any industrial or economic sector left to benefit from these free trade agreements. Moreover, and most importantly, Commissioner, try as you might to tell us that we are not questioning South Korea’s environmental and climate policy, that is not true. We are going to be able to export enormous saloon cars, those cars of which the manufacturers who make the least amount of effort to combat climate change are rewarded by this agreement. For the first time, the European Union is questioning the climate policy of one of its trading partners. Has the European Commission started to change, under pressure from Canada, its directive on fuel quality? We believe that we are putting Europe’s ambitions in the wrong order: the environment and the climate must come before trade. That is why our group will vote against this agreement. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at this early stage, to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue, which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements. The subject is an important one. As you all know, the forest is receding. Every two seconds, across the world, the equivalent of a football pitch is destroyed; within a year, an area the size of Greece is deforested. Clearly, this is a tragic situation. It is tragic from the point of view of diversity: a few thousand plant and animal species are threatened, and the forests which are most affected – tropical forests – contain half of the world’s biodiversity. It is obviously tragic, too, from the point of view of climate change: deforestation is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, deforestation puts some hundreds of millions of people in danger – people who either live in the forests or live off them. Forest exploitation and the forestry industry are among the principal causes of deforestation, particularly in the area on which we are focusing today: the Congo basin. It is estimated that 20 to 40% of the timber felled and exchanged in the world is illegal timber. The issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one. These voluntary partnership agreements have been approved in the context of the approval procedure within the Committee on International Trade. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this procedure allows the European Parliament to express its view. At the same time, however, it can only say yes or no. Hence, this debate is extremely important because it allows us to go into more detail, and it allows you, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, to respond to the questions that Parliament is putting to you. These agreements are important; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber. They also put in place independent verification procedures, and supplement forest policies and governance in the countries concerned. Today, we are talking about the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. However, I would like to make an initial point before going into these agreements and Parliament’s questions: we really must differentiate between legal timber and sustainable timber. Obviously, we are dealing with the legality of timber here, but legal timber does not necessarily mean sustainable forest exploitation. Therefore, the first general question that I would ask the Commission is: how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests – 2011 is the International Year of Forests – while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún, in particular, on the REDD+ mechanism, and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated, which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber? Next, we are still waiting for an answer from the European Commission on the question of biofuels and indirect changes in land use. As you know, Parliament has asked you to integrate these issues into the criteria for evaluating the sustainability of biofuels. More specifically, concerning the voluntary partnership agreements, there are many positive elements: we greatly appreciated the negotiation efforts and, in particular, the involvement of members of civil society in Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. We know that it is not easy and, from this point of view, these voluntary partnership agreements seemed to be a success. As I was saying just now, however, a number of questions and requests remain. Commissioner, are you ready to come, for example, every six months, or six months after the signing of an agreement, to update us on the implementation of the agreement? I ask because it is clear that the negotiation and the implementation of the agreement may be of a very different quality. We would therefore like you to come and tell us if the parties concerned, in particular, the members of civil society, continue to be involved in its implementation. In countries in which it is still not easy to complain, particularly when corruption exists, have complaint mechanisms been provided for – in particular, independent ones – so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to? In the same way, we would like you to regularly report on the impacts of the implementation of these agreements, so that you can tell us where we have got to with them, both in terms of the overall consistency of the Commission’s actions on forests, and in terms of their specific implementation on the issue of the legality of timber. Lastly, a final point: you claim that there is no budget in these agreements. Yet we will obviously need budgets to support these policies, so can you clarify the budgetary issue in relation to these voluntary partnership agreements? Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, once again, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. I believe that we have almost all spoken in the same terms: making this essential point about VPAs, which provide the link between development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society. I believe that, if there is one tool that we can use today to bring about sustainable development in these countries, particularly the African countries, it is undoubtedly the strengthening of civil society. As long as the only or the main expression of democracy in those countries is the vote to elect the President, then as we have seen – as the history of Côte d’Ivoire unfortunately reminds us – we will not make sufficient progress. Therefore, strengthening civil society – the fact that it plays a constant role in the implementation of these agreements, in the monitoring of forest exploitation, in the discussion on the conditions of this exploitation and in the sharing of revenues linked to this forest exploitation – is essential. It is through this strengthening of civil society, too, that we will respond best to the argument that we often hear concerning China: ‘Why should we meet the criteria for strong cooperation with Europe – social, democratic and environmental criteria – when China makes a mockery of them in terms of corruption and pillaging?’ Well, strengthening civil society is the best defence against this system which China, in particular, is trying to impose on the countries of the South. Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also – and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry – a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries. Thank you for your desire to work with the European Parliament. We are very happy about this future collaboration. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, like Mr Leinen, I wanted to emphasise the remarkable work that Commissioner Hedegaard and her team carried out in Cancún. Today, in a way, the success of Cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that, if the others take no action, we will take no action. The positive aspect of Cancún is that everyone must now engage with the machine of international negotiation, in particular, by strengthening their national or regional objectives. In terms of the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Europe now has to reach 30%. Reaching 30% is part of the objective of obtaining a decarbonised economy by 2050; 20% will not allow us to make this transition. Finally, in reaching 30%, we will also clearly be linking up now with the emerging economies: Brazil, China and South Africa. We know that these countries have some objectives which, up to a point, are currently superior to those of the European Union. We must therefore put a stop to inaction and the strategy of the status quo. The success of Cancún means that we must engage with the process of international negotiation in a much more constructive manner. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and, in principle, clearly, to support the adoption tomorrow of the report adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Let us come now to the unbelievable potential associated with energy savings, a point that has been made here. Reports from the European Commission itself say that if we called a halt to our excessive energy consumption, if we reduced our energy wastage by 20%, we could create one million jobs, we could save almost EUR 1 000 per European household, and we could clearly reduce our external energy bill. A 20% energy saving or reduction in Europe is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos in energy terms, and we are currently missing that target. Mrs Hall made this point, and the way I see it, we have trouble calculating. If reports show today that we are far from achieving 20%, then we can evaluate the savings that we make or do not make each year. We also know that this eco-design or eco-labelling approach for cars and so on does not result in overall coherence and does enable us to obtain the results that we are seeking. I am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here. Excuse me, Commissioner, but when you say that we have a problem in defining energy efficiency, this is perhaps true from a theoretical point of view, but the climate and energy package is very clear on the objective. It says that energy consumption must be reduced by 20% below the baseline level. This problem does not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency. There are energy levels that we need to return to – that is what the climate and energy package says. We are told that we do not need a binding objective. We are thus making one on renewables. A few days ago, in Cancún, the European Commission negotiated a binding agreement on climate change and tried to defend the Kyoto Protocol, and in this House we are citing the arguments of the United States and China by saying: ‘We will go for voluntary targets, and then, if one day we realise that they are not working, we will create binding targets’. With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building. There is scope to take a large-scale European initiative on building, which nevertheless accounts for 40% of our energy consumption; we can go much further on renovation. Finally, citizens are today facing the cold. They are paying very high prices for their energy. If Europe emerges from the crisis, energy will be much more expensive internationally. Citizens will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy prices. We must move much more quickly, and I would also ask you, Commissioner, to please stress to Mr Van Rompuy that the 4 February meeting should also be a meeting about energy consumption. From this point of view, the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, we propose changing the end of paragraph 22 by replacing ‘prevent’ with ‘inform’, so the final phrase becomes:  ‘reiterates also Parliament’s request to the Commission and Member States to inform the European Parliament about loans granted by export credit agencies and the European Investment Bank to projects that have a negative impact on the climate’. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could have limited my speech to simply recalling the images of this summer in Russia or southern Asia, to reminding you of the absolutely urgent need to combat climate change and, since we are talking about Europe, to move immediately, or as soon as we possibly can, to a target of 30% by 2020 for greenhouse gas emissions. Today, if we make no changes, we shall reach 19%. We have practically already reached the target that we set ourselves, so we can no longer speak of European ambition if we speak of 20%. As far as I am concerned, I am not an obvious admirer of the carbon market, but if we stay at 20%, we can be sure that we shall be treating the carbon market as a species in danger of extinction and not as a lever in the fight against climate change. Moving to 30% would potentially raise EUR 8 billion for European budgets by auctioning quotas. We know 30% is possible. In particular, a binding 20% energy efficiency target would mean a million European jobs. This represents savings of EUR 1 000 per household in Europe and, since Commissioner Oettinger mentioned Nabucco, it is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos. Are we then going to kill off European businesses if we move to 30%? Obviously not. Every study shows this to be so. Some sectors potentially at risk are affected, but the means exist, and until now, the sectors that threaten Europe with extinction are the sectors that have been the beneficiaries of European energy policy. They have gained billions of euros thanks to European climate policy. Moving to 30% would mean clearly siding with those who are bringing about change, siding with those who are making tomorrow’s world. I should also like to cite some figures. According to the Ernst &amp; Young 2010 Barometer, China and the United States are the most attractive countries for the development of renewable energy. According to a recent study, only three of the 50 businesses identified as world leaders in green technology are located in Europe; the others are in Asia or the United States. It is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30%, and I shall conclude by echoing the words of Barack Obama when he said that we could abandon the jobs of the future to our competitors or we could seize the opportunity of the century, as they have already begun to do. The nation that pioneers the energy of the future would be the pioneer nation of the 21st century, he said. He lost the elections. Let us take up this leadership in energy transition and the new economy. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, just as the European Union is trying to redefine its trade policy after the Treaty of Lisbon, while at the same time trying to reconcile it with its industrial policy, the fact that this Parliament is simultaneously debating three reports that address issues ultimately falling within the same political and public debate on ‘what is trade and how can it be reconciled with social, environmental and human rights issues?’ is to be welcomed. In fact, we are ultimately in a state of permanent schizophrenia: everywhere, companies are relocating, social rights are being called into question, environmental degradation is increasing and, at the same time, we are negotiating free trade agreements, we are negotiating within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a whole series of measures which, unfortunately, are totally out of step with the public debate in which our citizens are trying to engage. How can we explain to our public today that a football entering the European market produced under decent working conditions, where the environment is respected, and a football produced by child labour or in a country where trade unions are prohibited is the same football? We cannot explain this to our public. Our responsibility today is therefore to integrate these environmental and social issues into trade. Regarding my report more specifically, with respect to trade there are currently a number of European countries whose imports of products largely offset the reductions in their own emissions. A third of Europe’s emissions are not produced in Europe but correspond to imported goods. It is therefore essential to integrate the climate issue into our trade policies. How can we explain to our public that, at the same time as concluding a free trade agreement which will potentially lead to deforestation, we are going to Cancún to negotiate a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) agreement aimed at providing financial compensation for non-deforestation in the countries of the South? It is therefore essential to reconcile these different issues. When we drafted this report – and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups – we tried to be as constructive as possible. I hope this will be reflected in the vote tomorrow. We also tried to put an end to black or white debates. We no longer say that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100% of our industries in Europe, where, in a way, we do not care, because the climate issue must take precedence. When we worked on the issue of carbon leakage, for example, we always tried to specify which sector of activity might be put at risk and which tools could be developed to protect that sector. The same is true for the laws governing the framework for the anti-dumping discussion at the WTO. The same is true for production processes and methods. On all these issues, we tried, with the other groups, to come up with proposals to move things forward, and I believe that we have come up with concrete proposals that are commensurate with our ambitions, with the mandate of the European Commission and of all the European institutions. I would just say once again that I hope that the cooperative, constructive spirit in which we drafted this report will be reflected in the vote tomorrow and, once again, I would like to thank all my colleagues for the work they have done. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Commissioner De Gucht for his answers and for his proposal for work. I have taken note of his reply on the climate chapter, and I hope that we will also manage to work on the remaining aspects and make proposals that will result in concrete action being taken and certain elements being included in the trade agreements. Finally, the fact that the trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, which are undoubtedly very complex, have broken down also offers the European Union various opportunities to integrate more innovative elements into bilateral agreements and to try to construct new types of trade agreements which further integrate the EU’s objectives with regard to the environment, climate, human rights or social rights. This is therefore, in a sense, an opportunity. I believe it is a very strong request, and if these reports receive broad support tomorrow, this will indeed be – and I want to believe it will be – an extremely important signal from the European Parliament to the Commission and to the Council. I would like to reply to Mrs Stassen, who has left, regarding the economy. Books on the economy have continued to be written after the 19th century. We can therefore see that the challenges concerning the way in which to integrate social and environmental issues into production costs are an important factor in terms of defining the reality of comparative advantages. Similarly, Mrs Muscardini, you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the European Union. Moreover, if you are prepared, with me and others, to combat the Blair House Agreement, which is, after all, the main obstacle to real food sovereignty, to real food security today in Europe, you will have my support. Thank you, therefore, to all my colleagues, and to you, Commissioner, for your openness towards concrete work and concrete action with a view to the agreements that will soon be negotiated and concluded.

Mr President, Commissioners, I think we must note the convergence of this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and its Committee on International Trade on this matter and on the proposals presented in connection with it. It has been said that fishing is an extremely important sector for spatial planning, employment and cultural identity in Europe. It is also a sector which has an extremely strong impact on fisheries resources, and today a great majority of stocks are considerably overfished. Too often people would have us believe that the ultimate objective of a European common fisheries policy is to adapt the fisheries sector to globalised trade in fishery products, the extremely harsh effects of which we can see today, whether it be socially, economically or, of course, environmentally. We therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products. We support the idea of withdrawing fishery products from non-agricultural market access (NAMA) rules, because a fish is not a sock or a washing machine, it is absolutely crucial to food security and biodiversity. However, we must be clear. Since we are bringing this into international negotiations, our European policy must be exemplary and we must move in the direction of having more and better paid fishermen who do not overexploit fish stocks, either in our territorial waters or in those in which we buy fishing rights.

Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment, deleting two parts of the amendment, namely the words ‘by the Colombian army’ and ‘on Colombia’. Therefore, the amendment reads as follows: ‘considers that the alarming news concerning the killings of trade unionists in Colombia, as well as the news recently received and now confirmed by Colombia’s public prosecutor that mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in recent years have been discovered in the region of La Macarena, are sufficient evidence to enable the Commission to open an investigation in accordance with the regulation.’ Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, during the night of 27 to 28 February, storm Xynthia hit western France particularly hard, claiming many lives. Naturally, our thoughts are with the victims and all those who mobilised to help them. We are calling very clearly for the European Commission to make the Solidarity Fund available quickly in order to help the most affected people. However, we must also learn lessons from this tragedy. How is it possible that there are between five and six million people in France living in flood zones? There is obviously pressure from the property lobby, but it is also true that a few months ago, President Sarkozy was calling for construction in flood zones to be permitted. Responsibilities therefore lie with politicians. We are calling for all European cofinancing linked to reconstruction and restoration to be conditional on respect for the law: coastal law and prevention plans relating to flood risk. Naturally, we are also asking once again that we show swift support for all the worst affected sectors, in particular shellfish farming. Yannick Jadot,

Commissioner, it is good that you want to debate the result of this tool before the European Parliament, but the main thing to respect with regard to the European Parliament is the ordinary legislative procedure. We will find this tool useful, but it could be more operational, more effective and more transparent. More effective, in particular, if it took into account all the decentralised energy sources. It is not a matter of counting every single solar panel, but at Member State level we have information that you could gather to see what all the plans for decentralised energy add up to. When we are talking about democracy and transparency, I am surprised to hear our Liberal fellow Member reply ‘bureaucracy’. This instrument must be transparent, it must be debated, and the Commission must consult all the stakeholders, unions and associations, among others. Finally, taxpayers are contributing a great deal to the energy transition effort, and it is important that we have information on funding, to know exactly how taxpayers are funding energy transition in Europe. I hope that the amendments that have been tabled will be adopted by a large number of Members tomorrow, by more than there are here this evening. Yannick Jadot,

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis-related protectionism into its proper context. I think that, in the context of a debate, it is wise of you to point out that a world war linked to the revival of protectionism is not about to break out. Now, I almost want to reverse the issue. For me, the issue is not ultimately about what effects the economic crisis has on trade, but more fundamentally about what effects trade, and specifically the trade policies undertaken for 20 years, have on the crisis we are experiencing today. In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets. In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us. I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it. It follows that, in all the national debates – and, as a key figure on the Belgian scene, you will know this – all the political parties are now discovering that it is impossible, in a globalised world, to manage social dumping, environmental dumping, monetary dumping and fiscal dumping. Similarly, we might consider that the strategy that all us Europeans expected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was to say ‘social democracy will come about through trade’, is not working, as we can see with the example of China. Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure. Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have. Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world? Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure. I have a more specific question: on 4 February 2010, a meeting of the WTO’s Committee on Trade in Financial Services was held, and it focused specifically on the challenges presented by the financial crisis and the liberalisation of financial services. Can you tell us what the outcome of that meeting was and what your opinion is on this matter, if you were able to follow it? Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, as you said, this agreement breaks new ground. It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it. Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties. It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship. Secondly, this agreement also breaks new ground because, in trade negotiations, it is usually the farming sectors that resist and the industrial sectors that are satisfied. In this case, we see that the opposite is true. For the first time, it is literally major industrial sectors that are complaining about the decisions made by Europe. Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market. Just what do these figures mean, however? I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany. If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem. Now, we are told that we shall earn a small amount of money from pigs by trading with South Korea. The reality, in the region I represent, is that this intensification of pig farming leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of added value, a loss of tourism and, consequently, in my region, we are the losers in this agreement. Perhaps in your overall calculation, people gain from it, but in a region like mine, people lose. Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for. We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change. The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO2
 emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO2
 emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad. We therefore clearly see once again that, when it comes to an industrial strategy, a strategy for our businesses and the choice of economy, it will be more the case that Europe suffers this agreement than that it shapes it. You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy, the green economy and innovation. I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged. Finally, your approach to discussing issues is often very balanced, but as soon as people start talking about taxes, all of a sudden … On the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the Tobin tax, I bet you, Mr De Gucht, that before the end of your mandate, the Commission will have to speak out strongly on the Tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets.

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, I have been very surprised at the self-satisfaction you show with regard to EU action in the climate field. It is true that Europe has done more and better work in the last 10 years than most of the other countries in the world, but there was clearly a failure of European leadership in Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, we also saw Europe become simply the combination of the personal communication strategies of the European Heads of State or Government, and I should like to specifically mention Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Brown in this connection. Under these circumstances, it is clearly easy to knock the UN process. It is true that the UN system is complicated, and that a G20, where the agreements are meaningless but there are opportunities for major publicity stunts, is much simpler. This means that this coming year, Europe must do more and better work. We currently have a 20% target. However, 20% actually means doing less in the next 10 years than we have done in the past 10 years; it means reducing Europe’s climate effort. This is not only absurd for the climate, when the scientists are telling us that we have to reach a 40% target, but it is also absurd for our economy and jobs. Therefore, Mrs Espinosa, please do not reduce Europe’s climate ambition to the lowest common denominator, to the objectives voiced by President Barroso, who does not want to budge from the 20% figure, or to those voiced by Italy and Poland, which will soon deny the existence of climate change. Reread Parliament’s resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30%. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as we know – according to a number of scientific studies and also Yvo de Boer – emerging countries are today making at least as much effort as Europe with a view to 2020. We also know that, in the negotiations, there is already a right of scrutiny regarding emerging economies, and that this is exercised more and more through the emissions inventory, through the report on the measures taken. The World Resources Institute has published statistics showing that China stands at around 70 tonnes per capita, a cumulative figure since 1950, whereas the United States stands at 810 tonnes and the EU-27 stands at 413 tonnes. We therefore kindly ask you to have the good sense, first and foremost, to use the European Parliament resolution as a negotiating mandate. This would be the best thing we could do for the sake of both the climate and our emergence from the crisis in Europe. Next, I call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to have the intelligence and the credibility to withdraw its amendment that says that emerging countries must do the same thing, must make the same commitments as rich countries. That is not acceptable, that is not serious. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, after 15 years of negotiating the trade aspect of the Barcelona Process, we have very serious doubts about whether the negotiation of a Euromed-type free trade agreement is the right solution to the social, political and economic problems in the region. The impact assessment, as has been said, above all revealed that there were some potentially very serious negative impacts, whether social, environmental or in terms of regional integration. In this context, Mr President, Commissioner, we believe that the proposal being made by the Commission – the road map for 2010 and beyond – is too one-sided, with its bilateral free trade agreement aspect, to be along the right lines. We support the draft resolution that is being debated today, not least because it asks all these questions relating to social impacts, environmental impacts and impacts on regional integration, and above all because, in paragraph 10, it calls for the aims of the trade agreements to be revisited, particularly in view of these social and environmental issues, and then above all because, by revisiting these agreements, we could perhaps think about reintegrating the trade aspect into the overall Barcelona Process. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths, and inaction, for us, is a crime against humanity. We know that this is an emergency, we know that there is no plan B, and yet, today, the negotiations are at a standstill. It is easy to say that it is the United States’ fault, but we believe that Europe is also hugely responsible. Europe is unfortunately no longer, as the Prime Minister claims, the leader in the climate-change negotiations. Extending Europe’s current commitments to the entire planet means having 4 degrees of global warming by the end of the century, 4 degrees of global warming! That is unacceptable, and it will no longer be enough, as President Barroso is also claiming, to hide behind the legislative character of this commitment alone. Independent studies show today that Japan, Norway and Switzerland are ready to make greater efforts than Europe. With regard to the emerging countries – China, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia – they too are making commitments domestically that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them. If there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel’s speech, it is how to be modest and how to be realistic. Let us stop pretending that everything stands still outside Europe, that the world has not changed since Kyoto, and that Europe is always far ahead of the international community. In refusing to take account of the requests of the European Parliament and, in particular, of its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has assumed responsibility for something very serious: failure at the Copenhagen Summit. It is not too late; Europe can resume its leadership by immediately increasing its reduction target to 30% and by granting at least EUR 30 billion in aid to the countries of the South. In so doing, we will lead the countries of the South and force an agreement out of the Americans. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths and will cause millions more in the future. Inaction is a crime against humanity. This is an emergency, but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill. However, countries such as Japan, Australia, Norway, China, Brazil and South Africa are making efforts that are commensurate with their responsibilities. This is not the case with the United States, and it is unfortunately no longer the case with Europe. Extending Europe’s ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees. That is totally unacceptable. However, it is Europe that holds the key to Copenhagen. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if the European summit, acting on the European Parliament’s recommendations, takes the right decisions at the end of the month, then Europe can boost the negotiations – with targets of a 30% reduction and a EUR 35 billion aid package for the countries of the South. Mr President, the way in which certain Member States today use aid for the countries of the South as a negotiating tool is, in our view, absolutely shocking. The distress of the countries of the South is not a matter for negotiation. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I am an elected representative from a region in the west of France, where there is a very high concentration of dairy farmers, and I do not believe that you have acknowledged the tragic social situation they are experiencing today. Commissioner, when you speak of ‘producers’, what I hear is ‘manufacturers’ and ‘distributors’. Dairy producers do not need your compassion, Commissioner. They do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis. Dairy producers need a genuine agricultural policy. They need strict quotas. That is why we are calling on the Council to overturn your policy and instead to create a genuine policy to support dairy producers and to put an end to this policy of destroying them en masse.Hélène Flautre,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, during those nine months of work, with the confidence and valuable support of all key players, including – and I say this most emphatically – MEPs, who never gave up the fight for truth and justice, we were able to gain an awareness of the extent of the elements incriminating Europe and the Member States in the implementation of the CIA’s secret programme. All these key players are categorical and all the elements, that is to say, the research carried out by the Council of Europe, the special UN rapporteurs, the Red Cross, national and international human rights organisations, investigative journalists, the testimony of the victims, of their lawyers and of CIA agents, concur: the Member States have to answer for their active or passive complicity in crimes of torture, secret detention and enforced disappearance. For nine months, I was able to see the patently obvious limitations of the investigative steps taken by the Member States and their stubborn determination to conceal the truth: lack of political will, prevalence of national interests, narrow remits for investigations, abuse of state secrecy, lack of transparency, restriction of the rights of victims and of their lawyers. The imagination of national authorities knows no bounds. In putting this report to the vote, Parliament aims to take a decisive step towards putting an end to the denial of reality, and hence of justice, which has characterised the strategy of the EU Member States for 11 years now. Through its recommendations to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, the report expresses a simple and clear will: every effort must be made to ensure that rigorous, independent and transparent investigations, capable of determining responsibilities and obtaining justice for the victims, are concluded. The European Union and the Member States owe it, first and foremost, to the victims, but they also owe it to Europe’s citizens, who are entitled to demand from our institutions, from their institutions, respect for democratic values and the rule of law on which they are based. To be effective, we had to be concrete and specific and to stay abreast of the issue so that we could identify the best levers to help justice move forward. We therefore chose to focus on the issue of secret prisons on EU territory. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of Eurocontrol, which I thank, and to the visits and meetings of the Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) (rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs), today there are grounds for the report to adopt recommendations of relevance to Poland, Lithuania and Romania in particular. These three countries are now before the European Court of Human Rights facing allegations of torture, secret detention and failure to investigate effectively. Your rapporteur is convinced, more than ever, that only a coordinated European approach aimed at supporting Member States can break the code of silence. The challenge for the Council is to take the matter in hand officially and to put it on its work agenda, to acknowledge its responsibility and, finally, to apologise. The Commission, while having taken note of the facts, has still not mobilised all its justice and human rights resources and instruments to ensure that Member States comply with their fundamental obligations. It must take initiatives to uphold the principle of mutual assistance and solidarity. Commissioner Reding, the report invites us, you, the Council, the victims and all those who seek the truth to return to this House in a year’s time. Last week, Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen resident in Germany who had been detained without trial for five years at Guantánamo, again came to Parliament to speak about his ordeal, still very current, and to seek justice for the victims. Commissioner Reding, if Mr Kurnaz has the strength to come back in a year’s time, will we be able to tell him that facts have been established, that responsibilities have been acknowledged, and that we can, finally, apologise to him on behalf of the European Union? (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate to support this work, which has been long and arduous and which, as I said in my introduction, will bring us together again in a year’s time. I think that a lot can be done in the Member States in a year. We are not, of course, prosecutors and we do not have to ‘provide definite proof’. We simply know – if I take the example of Romania – that an investigation has been carried out in the Senate. You have pointed it out; it has been mentioned. I am also aware that there have been numerous allegations. I know that Eurocontrol has found evidence of new flights connecting Romania to Lithuania. A case file, which is mentioned in the complaint against Romania lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, was drawn up by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Hammarberg, and submitted to the authorities. None of these elements forms part of the public findings of the investigation. I think that it is not about singling out individual countries for general opprobrium because colleagues have placed great emphasis – and it is, I hope, a strong aspect of this report – on our collective responsibility. What is, in fact, happening? The reality is that each country holds a fragment of the truth. As a result, each country must carry out its investigations to the best of its ability so as to be able to expose this system because it is, in fact, a system. We have no intention of stigmatising this or that country. It is clear and evident – no one can deny it – that, in Romania, a new investigation, a judicial investigation, must be conducted, because the elements –which do not constitute proof; we are not prosecutors – are nevertheless important enough to warrant the reopening of an investigation. The report calls for nothing more, nothing less. The report asks Romania to conduct an investigation, and calls on the Commission, in fact, to show that each country holds a fragment of the truth and that the Commission, in particular, has the means, the power, the duty and the obligation to ensure that this fragment of truth enlightens other countries so that all EU citizens can be informed. You can do a lot. The rule is noted: you are strict, and I congratulate you on your resoluteness and on your regular interventions on fundamental rights violations within the framework of the implementation of EU law. However, in flagrant cases of unexplained massive violations, the means must be found to be accountable for the violations committed. For example, as regards the issue of interest to us here, you can bring in prosecutors, you can pool, or help to pool, information. You can translate all useful documents. You can gather together information and make it available to the Member States to help them conduct these investigations. The letters you are going to send once again to each Member State – which I welcome – must contain all the new elements that have come to light, including the analyses carried out by Reprieve
 of the data provided by Eurocontrol. That is what we are expecting, that is to say, a lot of work in the next year for a meeting which, I very much hope, will be a resounding success. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, last Thursday, a vessel from Turkey ran aground: 61 people, including 31 children, drowned. Most of them were Syrian refugees. The following night, a vessel sank close to Lampedusa, resulting in the deaths of several dozen people from Tunisia. Each new shipwreck adds to the macabre head count of the thousands of deaths already recorded in the Mediterranean. One has to question the responsibilities of the European Union and its obligations concerning rescue at sea. These people are fleeing war and poverty, but they are also faced with ever more perilous routes due to the obsession with security that characterises our migration policy. I call on the Commission to propose guidelines, as the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union required it to do, concerning rescue at sea. I also call on the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), which has developed a new human rights strategy, to implement it effectively in order to ensure the security of migrants. This is a humanitarian emergency. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, Ms Schaake has raised a very relevant issue with the Presidency of the Council. I am sure its representative will endeavour to provide a response to it. The situation on the ground, as described, has peaked, reaching new levels of apocalyptic violence and horror – with 800 deaths last week. The Human Rights Watch report, systematic torture in one of the 27 detention centres and the witness reports given are quite unbearable. At the same time, for just over a week now, I think, we have seen fresh diplomatic initiatives which are maybe precursors of the wind of change needed to find a solution. I think, even so, that the meeting held in Geneva made a start – albeit limited and not totally satisfactorily – towards the proposal for a transitional government of national unity, obviously without Assad and his torturers, but including some among its numbers. This has two benefits. In this situation, just because we feel that a solution is possible does not necessarily mean there will be less violence on the ground. Quite the contrary. We could see an escalation of violence by the regime. From this point of view, this proposal both encourages the mass desertions seen among soldiers of the regular army but must also enable acceptance of members of the Assad regime and the Baath Party as part of this interim solution. As things stand, I believe that this is extremely important. I hope that this prospect, which was encouraged by the meeting of all the components of the Syrian opposition, by the Arab League this week, by the meetings of the Russian Foreign Minister with the Syrian opposition, marks a turning point in this situation which offers a glimmer of hope. Moreover, I think that the EU should fully exploit this glimmer of hope, especially at the meeting of the Friends of the Syrian people in Paris at the end of the week. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, your words are hardly of any reassurance to me regarding the European Union’s capacity to take action. To be honest, it is calling on the opposition to unite for the umpteenth time, listing the risks that the situation presents for the umpteenth time, risks that have already been proven and are still very much present: regionalisation, militarisation, communitarisation, etc. These risks are also the result of the international community’s inability to have provided its support in good time to a people’s uprising against a dictator. I also believe that the situation is now so complicated and so difficult that there is no correct solution any more. However, inaction will cost us even more dearly. In other words, in three months’ time, we will be having the same old debate and you will be telling us how militarisation, communitarisation and regionalisation have been exacerbated further. Yes, we need to act then but there is no correct solution. Faced with the need and duty to protect the people, we are practically faced with the dilemma of having to choose whether we should violate international law by bypassing the Security Council. Yet we have to put all the options on the table. I heard Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra talking about a force being present on the ground. I also heard what Ms Brantner had to say. These options need to be looked at. This is absolutely urgent. We then need to put pressure on Russia because Russia, I can assure you, is in a very comfortable position. Today in France, the largest arms-producing company is currently showing at the international exhibition of weapons, in Villepinte, with total impunity. I have not heard anyone in Europe or in France, or you yourselves, dispute this fact. I therefore think that Russia does not feel under any threat whatsoever. We all know it is about the carrot and the stick with Russia. What have you dangled in front of them in your discussions? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, finally, since the start of this debate there have not been many fellow Members who believe that this agreement does not, in one way or another, undermine the fundamental rights of European citizens. To put it simply, some people are saying ‘It’s better than nothing. It would be worse if there was no agreement. In the end, it’s worth chipping away a little at our rights if we can see a corresponding benefit in terms of security.’ That is what we have been saying recently. Yet we know perfectly well – we have not only been saying it, but we have also demonstrated it – that a policy of combating terrorism, in order to be effective, rather than just being moral or meeting international obligations, must respect the totality of human rights, international law and our obligations. It is extremely hard to believe that this agreement could not be demolished by a court, if ever we in this Chamber were not able to shoulder our political responsibilities, because that is what this is actually about. Will we manage to stand beside the citizens of Europe – past evidence shows that they can only rely on the European Parliament in these areas – or will we allow ourselves to be overawed by threats? We have seen what happened in the past. With regard to the system implemented by the CIA, when there were secret prisons, illegal transfers and torture on our territory, who stood beside us in the Council and in the Commission to set up inquiries and find out who is responsible? No one. We want to cooperate. We have no mechanism of accountability when the services operate outside the legal framework. This is a serious matter.

Mr President, I said that, during our debate here in Parliament, no one denied the fact that we were in the process of seriously eroding the rights of citizens. You say that the citizens are not properly informed. However, you have undermined your case, Mrs Foster. It is a serious problem if we take citizens’ personal details when they themselves are even less able to monitor them because they are not even informed. To be frank, I think it is not sensible to go down a road – and we are going to say this to the European citizens – which would lead to them becoming involved in an American-style system for fighting terrorism, with military tribunals in the absence of procedural safeguards, endless cases of imprisonment and detention without charge. I truly believe that European citizens deserve to be informed of the fate that you want for them, Mrs Foster. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, this is not the first time this issue has been raised. I believe that all the bodies – the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, civil society organisations – have, at some time or other, sounded the alarm. What is more, this alarm has been heard by the Commission. Greece has since launched a national asylum and immigration plan. Today, however, there is no escaping the fact that the situation in the detention centres – and I have visited some in Greece – remains an insult to human dignity, that, since the start of the year, dozens of people have been killed at the Greek-Turkish border trying to cross the River Evros, and that NGOs are now seeing, within the context of the economic and social crisis in Greece, a sudden increase in racist attacks; they have recorded 63 cases in Athens and Patras, 18 of which involved police officers, during the last six months of 2011. It is clear that, in the period leading up to the elections in Greece, we hear preposterous proposals and a surfeit of extremely xenophobic policies – which can only be described as anti-immigrant – like the proposal to build detention centres, but, in particular, the proposal to herd together migrants and asylum seekers suspected of being ill. We also hear political leaders characterise the issue of migrants as a time bomb for society and for the security of the country. Confronted with this, of course, the European Union must respond with its values, its instruments and its principle of cooperation and solidarity. In this regard, it should nonetheless be said to the Member States that threatening Greece with expulsion from the Schengen area is an absolutely scandalous proposal, when, at the same time, the Member States openly regret that the Court prevents them from sending the asylum seekers back to Greece under the Dublin Regulation. Frankly, this cowardice and this hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the European Union cannot be tolerated, and the Commission has a great responsibility in this regard to guarantee our fundamental principles. As far as Turkey is concerned, I believe we should try to look at the situation as it is. With regard to the Community readmission agreement, Turkey is calling for equal treatment. Yet this is absolutely a case of double standards, since there is no prospect of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas with Turkey … (The President urged the speaker to bring her speech to a close)
 and that, at this very moment, Turkey is welcoming thousands of refugees at the Syrian border. I therefore believe that we should stop passing the buck from one country to another and assume this fundamental responsibility jointly. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am very pleased with this report and I would like to take the opportunity to thank its rapporteur, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, who has carried out an extremely comprehensive job. I think that this report, as a whole, calls for and supports the democratic reforms and the protection of fundamental freedoms in Turkey. I believe that the messages that it sends are extremely clear and precise and that they are of course addressed to the authorities, but also to all the actors in the political arena and civil society to encourage them to become more involved in further strengthening the democratic State in Turkey. The report does not fail to make clear our grave concerns regarding the way in which the law against terrorism has been applied, directly threatening freedom of expression and opinion, the right to hold demonstrations, the freedom of the press and we are asking for this law to be amended, particularly Articles 6 and 7. We also support and call for a thoroughgoing reform of the judicial system: citizens, all citizens in Turkey, must be able to trust an efficient, impartial and independent judicial system and we support any reform that works towards this end. We have also looked at the Kurdish question and we are clearly of the view that education in one’s native language is a perfectly satisfactory proposal to provide a response to the Kurdish question that is political and not merely for reasons of security. I think that these strong messages are all more credible when we do not hold back on our demands in the Council, particularly to ensure true consistency and to enable the European Union to finally recover its ability to pioneer reforms in Turkey and to use leverage to promote them. We are asking for all these measures to be taken with a view to opening chapters 23 and 24. Our demands are also clear in the case of visas: we need a roadmap for the liberalisation of visas, as this situation in a country in the process of accession to the European Union is quite unique, and therefore totally discriminatory. We want these essential messages to be heard in Turkey and I would not wish for the readership of this excellent report and its importance in relation to the current situation in Turkey to be diminished or detracted from by questionable statements. What is the purpose of the reference in this text to the secular integrity of the armed forces? We are delighted with the huge amount of work which has been achieved in Turkey over a number of years to ensure that the armed forces recover their place, under the control of the civil authorities, and for military expenditure to be brought under the oversight of the Court of Accounts. What is the purpose of this reference to the secular integrity of armed forces which have served NATO since 1952, which are one of its largest armed forces and the presence of which is being made conditional on this secular integrity? We know the nature of the armed forces of a secular, non-religious State. That is what we want for Turkey and I think that together we must delete those words. As for the Ergenekon trial, lastly, it is not credible to cast doubt on all cases in the Ergenekon trial as we know, and the European Court of Human Rights reiterated this in December in a judgment, there are perfectly well-founded cases where arrests on the basis of accusations of crimes or criminal acts have been judged to be well founded by the European Court of Human Rights. We cannot let ourselves be suspicious of and rule out all the cases involved in the Ergenekon trial. My opinion is this: if we remove these two references, we will have the widest possible readership, which is extremely important, in Turkey, in society as a whole, and in its entire political and social fields. (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, I actually think that we are no longer talking here of repression or of an oppressed people, but of an intolerable terror, perpetrated by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. We only need to see how public hospitals have now been transformed into centres of torture, execution and kidnapping. Given that, I will not list the considerable number of people injured, the number of people who have disappeared, the number of detainees or the number of deaths. The UN Human Rights Council got it right when it said that we are dealing here with crimes against humanity. Ms De Keyser is right: Assad will have to account for his crimes before the International Criminal Court. In the face of this terror, I sincerely wish to salute the courage, determination and the incredible capacity for resistance shown by organised civil society in Syria as, despite everything, the food arrives, despite everything, information is exchanged, despite everything, protection is provided for those who demonstrate. Despite everything, medical care is provided in living rooms that have been transformed into emergency hospitals. I believe that the channels that are in place are precarious and dangerous. We should discuss and work to see how we might now intensify the movement of goods, care, food and protection via these informal channels, how we can make it secure, stronger and broader, how we can protect those who are risking their lives to move these goods. This, I feel, is the first way to give practical help, which is what we are calling for. Obviously, sanctions must be strengthened and it is necessary, above all, to ensure that they are implemented appropriately. I really do believe that the European Commission and the Council have to ask themselves how a boat laden with arms was able to sail to Syria from a Cypriot port to supply Bashar al-Assad with weapons that he is using against his own people. There is the Arab League initiative. Of course, it has to be supported, but vigilance is required too. We are well aware that the Arab League represents a set of extremely diverse interests. We are well aware that the initiatives there are proliferating before the Presidency of the Arab League is taken over by Iraq. All this is well known but, given the situation, the European Union must very clearly define its strategy and be able to deliver it on the 24th in Tunis. It is right that this meeting should take place in Tunis, because it is important. It shows that this story is, first and foremost, the story of a people at the mercy of its oppressor. We are looking at Syria as a piece on a complicated chessboard and, if we move that piece, we are wondering what the next moves might be. We have to come back to the base of the conflict, of this battle, to support the population. The story unfolding today in Syria is truly that of a society that is struggling for democracy and for rights. Without being naïve, we should see that as the main goal, towards which we should turn all of our efforts. As a result, the meeting on 24 February must allow us to isolate or bring on board those countries that currently support the Syrian regime. Of course, there is China and Russia, but there is also Algeria. We must apply maximum pressure to isolate Assad. That is one way to give practical help. We must also recognise the National Council. It has its faults, but we must maintain a political dialogue with it to help it to become the political interlocutor for the future Syria. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I would like to stress the last point raised by Ms Schaake, because, indeed, not only is it a disgrace, it is also utterly ludicrous, that the European Union and its Council have not come up with the political means to invite Turkey to the table to discuss the situation in Syria. It is now clear that the future scenario called for by Ms De Keyser can only come about through dialogue between Turkey, in particular, the Arab League and the European Union. It is true that there is no written script, but, nevertheless, we do have some assurances. Firstly, Bashar al-Assad will fall. He will fall. That is the deeply-held belief that we all share and, at best, he will be handed over to the International Criminal Court. He will therefore fall. What this tells us is that civil society has an incredible capacity, not only to mobilise itself, but also to coordinate and organise itself, and to do so neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city, through a totally effective and impressive horizontal network. Just look at what they achieved with the first of six stages of the general strike in Syria, when they called on everyone not to go to the mosque, not to go shopping, to close shops early, to stay at home, not to make telephone calls, to carry out some form of civil disobedience. ‘Dead Syria’, just like the ‘dead city’ that is often referred to. We can see how impressive the organisation behind this is. What we have here is a population adopting the approach of civil disobedience and non-violent action. I do not really want to repeat what you have said regarding the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and which was picked up by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, but I do not get the feeling at all that we are now on the brink of civil war. What is certain is that growing numbers of soldiers, including those in the Free Syrian Army, are assuming the role of protectors of the people in coordination with local committees. It is absolutely essential that we offer our assistance in this very specific battle on the ground, which is being conducted in a non-violent manner with the Free Syrian Army offering defence and protection. This is where we must be effective, offering very simple but practical things: help with radios, communications, intelligence capabilities for the opposition, capabilities in the field of new technologies once sold to al-Assad, but which we must now supply to the opposition. These are the concrete steps that we can take to strengthen their operational capability and I think ... (The President cut off the speaker) Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), we focused instead on communications regarding the new partnership for mobility, for two reasons: because of the aspirations expressed, aspirations to rights, including, it would appear, the right to mobility, and also because, to date, our migration policy with these countries clearly rested in the iron fists of dictators who, I am glad to say, are no longer in place. We therefore take a very positive view of the partnership for mobility but would like to question the link still established between the readmission agreements, legal migration and the fight against illegal immigration, relying solely on the report prepared by the Commission itself on readmission agreements. The report says that implementation is inconsistent and not transparent, that the negotiating mandate is unrealistic, that there are serious risks of human right violations and that even this assessment acknowledges that visa liberalisation has no impact on illegal immigration. I therefore think that a little further reflection is needed and then, above all, we need to develop an approach with these countries that is fully rooted in the mutual benefits of mobility, establishing a structured dialogue. And when we talk about partnership with civil society, this means both mobility and other issues, it is critical that this partnership with civil society, which is the key to success, includes a concrete mechanism for consulting civil society at all stages, early on during the implementation and evaluation.

 Mr President, neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission, nor even the Council, I was going to say, have stood helplessly by in the face of the extremely serious discrimination suffered by the Roma. Parliament is well known for its resolutions on this subject. The European Commission set up a Roma Task Force and issued a Communication on the issue in April 2011, and the Council adopted a European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies for each Member State at the end of June. Nevertheless, I feel that this text certainly has inherent weaknesses, attention to which was drawn at the time. This weakness concerned the goals that were set concerning the fight against anti-Gypsyism and discrimination. Consequently, now, with just one month to go before Member States must submit their strategies to the European Commission, we have grave doubts about the efforts governments have made to include stakeholders, local and regional authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Roma populations themselves in drawing up their national strategies. Above all, however, I have the feeling that day after day, an extremely worrying situation is emerging from the press, from eye-witness accounts, from facts related by NGOs and from reports. They speak of violence and hateful anti-Roma demonstrations, attempts on their freedom of movement, segregation at school, forced expulsions, human trafficking, forced sterilisation of women, and of the way that anti-Roma rhetoric has become commonplace in political circles. Faced with this, I believe that our positive, inclusive agenda must categorically go hand in hand with the utmost vigilance and be rigorously enforced. I believe that the European Commission must use all the means at its disposal to be extremely strict towards Member States in its role as guardian of the acquis communautaire
 and of the Treaties. Let me quote you an example. The massive expulsions that took place in France have just been unambiguously condemned by the Council of Europe as ‘an aggravated violation of human rights’. In its defence, the French Government cited the decision of the European Commission, which, as the French Government saw it, found the evictions to be completely compatible with European law. I believe that Member States should no longer be able to resort to this type of argument and that the Commission must be extremely strict. As for us, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we too must do more. In addition to our extremely important work, we should set up a monitoring group to include members of national parliaments, in association with NGOs, so that we can in any case fight much more effectively against the discrimination suffered by the Roma.

The Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from voting on the 2012 budget at first reading on 26 October 2011. We deeply regret the creation of an envelope of EUR 200 000 ‘to fund pilot projects or other support activities aiming to analyse the public acceptance of the exploration for and exploitation of shale gas and introducing a dialogue on this matter’. We cannot accept that a single European cent be used to fund propaganda in favour of shale gas. Furthermore, this first post-Fukushima budget still grants a substantial allocation to the ITER nuclear reactor, which is an extravagant and pointless project, and a dead end in terms of energy and ecology. For these two reasons at least, we were not able to vote in favour of this draft budget, despite the fact that green pilot projects, an increase in financial assistance for Palestine and substantial savings in administrative costs have been adopted. We have therefore decided to abstain, particularly so as not to weaken Parliament’s position in the difficult negotiations now due to begin with the Council. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am not sorry that we are having this debate, because at the end of the day, there has not been any discussion of Turkish-Cypriot relations nor of the situation in Cyprus since 2004. So this is the first time since then that we have had an open discussion about a European Union Member State in which there has been a United Nations international peace-keeping mission since 1964 in relation to a conflict with a country engaged in the accession process. Stating the facts naturally highlights the fairly ludicrous nature of the situation. As far as I am concerned, this debate is not about whether Cyprus is exercising its sovereign right by deciding to drill in its exclusive economic zone. That is beyond doubt. International law clearly says that Cyprus is in the right, but equally we could envisage a situation whereby, under a future agreement, the benefits from that drilling would be shared fairly between the two communities. Having said that, I feel that the timing of the operation is reprehensible because, at the end of the day, this decision is prejudicial to the negotiations due to begin in the coming days under the aegis of the United Nations. In my view, the role of our Parliament – as has already been demonstrated – is not to engage in one-upmanship but rather to make a constructive contribution to achieving overall peace within the framework of an agreement for a federal country made up of two zones and two communities. What is more, the substance of a future agreement is known and almost – I nearly said for the most part – on the table. The question that we need to ask ourselves as Europeans is what Member States and the European Union are doing to bring a political agreement into the world and to encourage all the stakeholders to take constructive confidence building measures. However, sometimes I feel that the question of Cyprus is intentionally left to one side, to be used when the need arises in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey. I would like practical measures to be taken today by the Union and the Member States to support and encourage a rapid resolution to what is essentially a European problem. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, the Frontex Agency is an agency that has been untouched by the crisis, given that its budget has increased from just over EUR 6 million in 2005 to more than EUR 80 million today. In other words, Frontex has grown without facing any awkward questions for many years. Ultimately, the Member States saw something to be gained from this: firstly, the availability of resources for their own internal operations; secondly, the opportunity to turn to Frontex when faced with countries that were seen to be failing to control their borders; and thirdly, the increase in Frontex’s powers and resources, which everyone was calling for. This also enabled the Director of Frontex, only two years ago, to tell MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who were worried about human rights being violated, that it was not Frontex’s job to deal with that issue; it was the responsibility of the Member States! Frontex has ultimately grown against this backdrop of irresponsibility with regard to human rights. I think that, today, it is really to the credit of Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, that the issue of fundamental rights protection was placed so high on the agenda of the negotiations. I say this, of course, because the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force and Frontex is now accountable for its actions to the Court of Justice, which is no small thing; and also because a number of reports show that the principle of non-refoulement has been violated several times during Frontex operations and that access to asylum application procedures, which is an inviolable and international right, has been somewhat mismanaged. We are also awaiting a report from Human Rights Watch, which will show that Frontex is responsible, to some extent, for the unfair detention of migrants. We therefore had a real problem with regard to respect for human rights, and I believe that the negotiations have enabled us to make serious progress in this area. Nevertheless, this does not mean that my group will be voting in favour of this mandate, because we believe that independence – as mentioned by Ms Lochbihler in particular – independent observation, and reliable, impartial and independent procedures for combating human rights violations, have not been established. This is what will ultimately lead my group to abstain. Moreover, I should like to take advantage of this debate in order to question the Commission and the Council on the results and the status of Operation Hermes, the most recent Frontex operation: boats, helicopters, 2 000 drowned in the Mediterranean since the NATO intervention in Libya. What did Frontex do during this time? I do not know. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, all these populations are putting a colossal amount of energy into overthrowing regimes that are enemies of freedom and are oppressing them. We cannot help but admire this energy, and it puts paid to the prejudices held in various quarters about the supposed backwardness of the Arab world. As has already been said, it requires a good deal of the European Union to rise to the challenge of these aspirations. For us to condemn the violence, support those who promote change, impose sanctions on the dictators, start again from scratch the deals we had negotiated with fallen powers, take on board the human, political and economic consequences of the upheaval that is going on, prevent counter-revolutionary attempts, mitigate the causes of destabilisation and rebuild our relationship as one of partnership, is a revolution in itself for the European Union. Who now seriously believes that Bashar al-Assad is capable of beginning a political process that would involve those who promote democracy and change, and would establish the rule of law? I certainly do not, and I do not think many people do. And yet, there is no appeal to President al-Assad to leave power in our resolution. Nor is there a majority, unless we see proof to the contrary, willing to call the atrocities committed by this regime against peaceful citizens crimes against humanity, which is what they are, and to bring a case before the International Criminal Court through a Security Council resolution. I do not think we have exhausted all the possibilities for diplomacy. Turkey could provide valuable help on this, if it can persuade the hesitant countries that have been mentioned, especially Russia and Brazil, but also China. Taking responsibility also means protecting. It means resettling refugees, activating temporary protection, rescuing people at sea. These are the concrete steps that the European Union should be proposing for refugees, instead of organising top-level crisis meetings to discuss EU law. If the EU wants to be consistent, it needs a system that will allow civil society to be involved at every stage in defining objectives and indicators and in implementing and evaluating the EU’s agreements with its future partners. This will represent real change for the European Union. Our partners are now accountable to their people, and their people are eagerly expressing their democratic demands. Baroness Ashton, you were correct in your intuition and your analysis, well before the revolutions began. At the beginning of your mandate, you said that the validity of the EU’s external policy would be tested in its own neighbourhood. How true that is! If the Union rises to the challenge of these peoples’ democratic aspirations, its role on the new world scene will no longer hang as a question mark over the suffering that is piling up. In the situation as it stands today, it is the status of the European Union in this 21st century world taking shape before our eyes that is at stake. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, it is very good news that populations are moving to reclaim their freedoms and rights, and to obtain a change of the political regime and more democracy. This is at the heart of the European Union’s foreign policy and of the European project. That can only evoke our enthusiasm and our support. The very bad news, however, is that these populations are suffering an extremely tough repression, demonstrating these values and aspirations while putting their lives at risk, and that is totally unacceptable. Thus, the imperative of protecting the populations, which has led to military action in Libya, must now take other forms to protect those who are demonstrating in these three countries. I think that the statements are extremely important – the legitimate statements, the aspirations held by these populations – but we also need action. As part of this action, we need an assurance that all those leaders responsible for using disproportionate force against their populations will not go unpunished. In order to do that, the diplomatic convocation and activation of the Member States of the United Nations Human Rights Council must be in full swing in order to get missions, reports and resolutions so that the politicians responsible get an assurance that these acts of violence will not remain unpunished. Finally, I think that we certainly do have methods for bypassing the ‘blackout’ of the press. Journalists, whether national or foreign, are facing considerable difficulties in documenting the situation. We know what to do; we have instruments for bypassing these obstacles. We absolutely must make use of them. Then, when we have the means to act, I think that we must find a way of using them. Clearly, this is not the time to chase the Syrian President to get his signature on a readmission agreement, which could, in any case, only be envisaged under certain conditions, including a very serious, effective and relevant programme, the implementation of reforms in Syria and the freeing of all prisoners of conscience and peaceful demonstrators, not just here, but also in the other two countries.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the popular movements in the Southern Mediterranean have clearly highlighted weaknesses in our European Neighbourhood Policy. As I see it, the problem lies not so much with the Neighbourhood Policy objectives, which are set out in Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty of Lisbon on promoting and respecting human rights and democracy – which are also social objectives – but rather in our flawed implementation of those objectives. Consequently, we need to learn lessons for the future. This is what is being done in the current work on reviewing the policy. The first issue, which was raised by Mr Schulz, is our ability to provide real and effective support for civil society in all neighbouring countries, irrespective of their importance in terms of trade or strategy, or their political situation. When neighbouring countries are in a state of transition, this is extremely useful and necessary. It is also undeniably easier than when they are labouring under the yoke of an authoritarian regime, as is the case in Syria, but this is a challenge, an issue, that we need to learn to address effectively. I believe that we will also need to learn to discuss these matters with our partners, not only in forums dedicated to human rights, such as sub-committees, but also at the highest political level. Yet, at the same time, we must ensure that sub-committee agendas do not become disconnected from the situation, as has happened in the past, or fail to feed into other bodies, such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA). I support the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which I believe is pivotal. It seems to me that we should also add a separate target for social justice and combating inequalities. Naturally, we will also need to rethink our understanding of mobility in the Mediterranean region. I think that the mobility partnership is a positive feature, but we will also need to learn how to promote the benefits of this mobility for individuals who travel between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and for both the host nation and the country of origin. We will also need to factor these changing movements into basic rights for those who cross the Mediterranean and settle in Europe. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, it is of course good news that we now have a concrete European framework that is going to place an obligation on every Member State to present its national Roma integration strategy. Between now and the end of the year, the Commission will assess these strategies and then in roughly one year’s time we will need to debate the issue again. Today, we are therefore in effect setting out a road map which should allow parliamentarians, public bodies and civil society to exercise ongoing, extreme vigilance in the very important areas you have mentioned. I note that the Commission communication takes on board some of the points we set out in the parliamentary report. I am talking for instance about the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency in the assessment of the strategies. I believe the Agency has proven its competence in this area. I am also talking about developing cooperation with the Council of Europe on training mediators from the Roma community. This is an important strategic factor for the success of the projects at all levels, as is the attention devoted to Roma who are nationals of third countries and the enlargement aspect, which is taken into consideration in this report. Lastly, I think that establishing common indicators to support the monitoring system is very much to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I must emphasise certain failings in this communication. I believe it is not sufficiently strong and insistent in its reference to the necessary participation of Roma at all levels, that is to say at the levels of preparing the projects, implementing the projects and evaluating them. The communication talks about information and consultation, but the involvement of the Roma community itself is vital. There is ample experience to prove this, because there have actually been good experiences in Europe as well. I find this a weakness in the communication. A second weakness in the communication is that it deals with the issue of non-discrimination as a cross-cutting theme in each of the four areas. However, I think it is very important, or would have been very important, to have a special paragraph devoted to combating discrimination and violence and to access to justice for the Roma. This anti-discrimination, fundamental rights, access to justice component is not included as a specific component in its own right. I find this another weakness in the Commission document. I think we also talked about the subject of mediators, a programme that was launched by the Council of Europe. It is good that it is mentioned in this communication. We could have mentioned, and you also could have mentioned the guidelines that have already been drawn up by the Council of Europe, so that we do not somehow end up with two strategies, or two types of framework for assessing the national strategies. I feel this would have been a plus in this communication. Finally, I think that the Commission’s work is not yet finished, and that the task force should continue its work, in order to ensure that Member States are constantly aware of the pressure on them from the Commission, civil society and local bodies to actually implement these guidelines.

 Mr President, the work that has been undertaken here on this report, under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume, is very important. As Mrs Malmström said, it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system, and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system. One ought, in fact, to call it an abyss, an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking. When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1-65%, when we have, in a State such as France for example, 75% of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal, when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect, we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission – and which is strengthened by the high quality report drafted under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume – namely, to improve the quality of decision making at first instance, is absolutely crucial. As I understand it, the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying, and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers. It should be remembered that Cyprus, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population. Let us listen to those States too, then, because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I do not think that we can welcome the revolution in Tunisia, on the one hand, and demand that the country implements the border control policy that existed in the days of the Ben Ali dictatorship, on the other. I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government, which has many other matters to attend to: its own refugees – as has been said – and overseeing its democratic transition process. The situation, then, is a new and exceptional one, and this should perhaps enable us to think up appropriate solutions while at the same time showing solidarity. Baroness Ludford is right – that is what is definitely lacking the most within the European Union. I think that the work of the European Commission, and of Parliament, could consist firstly in declaring a moratorium on the return of Tunisians, because that really is improper and inappropriate. We should also grant exceptional permission to reside to Tunisians who have already arrived in France and Italy, guarantee access to Europe to people seeking protection, and refrain from taking any steps or concluding any agreements that might get in the way of that protection, apply the provisions – as has been said – of the 2001 directive to all those eligible to take advantage of them, and accommodate refugees present at the border between Tunisia and Libya as part of the resettlement process. Next, I believe that we must think about forging cooperative links with these future fully democratic countries, so that Tunisians can come and work, study and travel perfectly legally, so as to create real channels of mobility between the two shores of the Mediterranean.

 Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work in providing rigorously detailed documentation and in drawing up a report in the utmost good faith with the aim of sending clear political messages, particularly on the eve of the legislative elections in Turkey, and I endorse this work. This report – unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable – stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution. However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors? There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations – in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 – and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner. Now, everyone can see that it is not. We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition. I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey’s accession. I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation. Today, this is very clearly in question. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, unfortunately, every day in the press, we read accounts of discriminative or racist acts against the Roma. Therefore, this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves, of course, and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union’s fundamental values. The Commission will therefore have to develop a framework, a European strategy, for the national action plans. Its responsibility will extend far beyond the development of this European framework for the national action plans, because the Member States will make progress on this subject only if they are given a strong incentive by the Commission to commit themselves to it. This will require – as the report explains very well – an extremely precise evaluation of the results obtained, with the use of benchmark criteria and indicators. It will also require the involvement of all interested parties and Roma communities in the first instance. I believe that it is very important to make the connection with the Council of Europe’s programme on the training of Roma mediators. This is an essential condition if the inclusion projects are to be crowned with success at regional level. Next, the European Commission also needs to get involved through its own projects, run by itself, pilot projects – that is what this report proposes – which could be run, for example, in the micro-regions that we have spoken about, so that exemplary, remarkable projects can convince all interested parties to become involved in this inclusion process. I believe, then, that the European Commission should also be able to use its right to officially complain when the values, European legislation and national action plans are not as they should be, bearing in mind equal access to all rights, non-discrimination and freedom of movement. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Gomes for giving us the chance to debate a mandate for negotiations that is certainly thorny, as is the content of the negotiations themselves. The Tunisian example should serve as a warning that we need to proceed very cautiously, especially in the way in which we report on the negotiations. We cannot simply notch up successes as we go through the negotiations and celebrate because a regime such as the Gaddafi regime may have agreed to certain human rights references, for example, because that regime is well-known for its major violations of all fundamental rights. What is more, all the migrants who arrive on our shores, though they are increasingly fewer in number, say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to Libya, because of the rapes, torture, abuse, forced repatriations, mass expulsions and racist acts. It has already been said, and I will repeat it: the list of serious, mass human rights abuses of migrants in Libya is long. So yes, of course, I think it is absolutely urgent that we do everything in our power to improve these people’s situation. This is a job for the High Commissioner for Refugees, and it is our task to resettle the individuals identified by the HCR. It is also a job for community-based organisations, which, at the moment, are extremely thin on the ground and need to be strengthened by all means possible. I believe that, if we truly want to abide by the goals we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties, we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants staying illegally in the EU back to Libya.

 Mr President, I think the aim of this discussion is to get the Council to finally show its hand, because I have to say that given such an ambitious, not to mention necessary, reform package on asylum, it is unbelievable that all we are getting are snippets of information, some contradictory, as to what is holding the Council up on these proposals that have been on the table for a long time now. We are getting a vague idea that the Council or the Member States may be stalling because of costs, but it is not even clear what is meant by this. Are they talking about human costs, political costs or financial costs? These different costs are sometimes linked in any case. One thing is for certain: there are instances of unsatisfactory practices and inadequate protection in Europe at the moment. In the first place, it is not true that Europe shoulders all the world’s problems. For example, in 2007, I think Europe took in only 14% of the world’s refugees. In the second place, some of the existing practices are utterly unacceptable. I am thinking of instances such as phallometric testing in the Czech Republic, right here in Europe, or the documents of the Committee against Torture, which brought to light many cases such as forced repatriation without the right to appeal or based on hurried-through procedures. I think we can certainly talk about costs: for example, we could talk about the cost of expelling migrants, which is very costly: the French Senate says that it costs EUR 20 000 per person expelled. Above all, we can talk about how we might improve the situation. There are certainly questions to be asked as to how we can improve the first-instance decision-making process, as Mrs Guillaume has done in her report, when roughly 50% of first-instance decisions are overturned on appeal. There are clearly very substantial economies to be made in terms of financial, human and political costs. We might take another look at the aberrations of the Dublin Convention, and I think the Council should look very carefully at these, because they also represent very substantial costs both in human and in financial terms. Lastly, and I will end here, one thing that is very expensive is detention, as the Parliamentary study confirms. The cost of detaining asylum seekers is prohibitive. This needs to be said, people need to be told and it needs to be discussed in the Council. This is absolutely urgent. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, this is a very good report, and the first one after the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, for her hard work, receptiveness and fruitful cooperation. I would like to come back to four messages contained in this report. The first concerns our requirement for the Commission to fulfil its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The situation of the Roma people has sadly been the first practical case, and the Commission has, in the end, only gone halfway on this matter, basing itself solely on the Free Movement Directive. The Commission has sidestepped the non-discrimination issue on the basis of Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it cannot be so half-hearted in future, with the ratification, by the Union, of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am delighted to see the Union’s commitment to seeing this through. The added value of this report also resides in the fact that it emphasises the need for early detection of potential violations through the implementation of a warning system. This system makes provision, among other things, for measures suspected of constituting such violations to be suspended while the accelerated procedure for determining whether they are contrary to fundamental rights is carried out. I would also insist on the need to set up a prevention system on the model, for example, of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism within the United Nations Council. Once again, I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes, as you have already mentioned, Mrs Reding. In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge. We are blindly endorsing these agreements when the actual terms of their implementation are being decided in joint committees from which Parliament is excluded. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, it has to be said that it is extremely odd to begin a directive which is intended to guarantee a legal framework for proper access to rights for all workers with a long list of the categories of workers excluded from that directive. That makes it seem like a project for legal migration but also for a multi-layered European labour market, where each category of workers would be assigned, according to their worth, a sort of portfolio of rights. We are therefore a long way from a horizontal and universal approach to workers’ rights. I think that those responsible in Europe have still not understood that more rights for workers means greater economic efficiency and greater social cohesion, with greater individual and collective benefits, of course, for migrants, for the host societies and for the societies of origin. Indeed, this has been shown in a study by the London School of Economics which says that regularising 600 000 irregular workers in Great Britain, who will not have access to this single application procedure, would bring GBP 3 billion into Great Britain’s coffers. We are not, I think, at all equal to the challenges. Hélène Flautre,

 Good evening Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Reding, you are quite rightly delighted today that France has responded to the European Commission's infringement proceedings at the eleventh hour and has provided a legislative programme for establishing procedural rights as required under the directive on the freedom of movement. According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice – as opposed to cancelled. We have taken note of your comments but as Members of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments. That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French authorities. However, let us not forget that you also asked France about individuals who have been escorted to the border and required to leave the country, an enquiry intended to confirm that these administrative procedures were not discriminatory. What has happened to those enquiries? Have you received a response? Just as the press revealed information about the villainous and discriminatory August circular, information was recently published about a file – a database – which contains personal information including details of ethnic or racial origin. Has this new twist not dented your confidence in the promises made by the French authorities and the accuracy of the information provided? Mrs Reding, would you not agree that the logical next step is now to tell us the current state of play in the ongoing examination of the documents requested by the Commission, both on the alleged discriminatory practices in France, but also regarding the potential infringement of data protection standards as laid down in Community law? I think that today’s European citizens are entitled to demand a responsible Commission which may publicise its successes but will also be determined in persevering with proceedings against the French authorities. After all, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which, it is widely recognised, have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma. I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data, in which the subjects are described as Gyppos, Gypsies or Roma.

 Madam President, I actually find our rapporteur very unwise in asking us MEPs to ratify and approve an agreement which really is highly problematic. First of all, it concerns Pakistan, which is not just any old country. Pakistan already admits more refugees than any other country in the world. And what are we mainly going to ask it to do? Readmit Pakistanis, of course, but also the Afghans who are here in Europe fleeing a war that we are waging in Afghanistan. I think we are starting to border on something like indecency here. It is a fact that Pakistan has not ratified the Geneva Convention, and it is a fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe asks us to ratify readmission agreements only with countries that offer a number of guarantees in terms of the right of asylum and international protection, which is not the case in Pakistan. Furthermore, there is a huge number of questions. If I had to say ‘Yes’ tomorrow, I do not even know what I am saying ‘Yes’ to. If you look closely at these various articles, the impact of this article may be anything from 20, may be anything from 100 to 20 000, and perhaps more. Why? Because nobody is saying what the responses will be to everything that is decided in the Readmission Committee. Who is responsible for proving that an individual arrived after the agreement had been ratified? Who will be responsible for proving that that individual arrived in the EU directly from Pakistan? What is going to happen at the end of the thirty day period if Pakistan does not respond and does not issue travel documents? Are we, as Members of the Commission suggest, going to accept this strange EU ‘pass’ instrument? I do not have any answers, and neither do you, Mrs Malmström; I know that you will be unable to provide me with any answers. I asked the Pakistani Ambassador, and he does not have any answers. All of that will be buried in the Readmission Committee. As we are incapable of saying what the actual impact of this agreement will be, I cannot say that I accept it. Everything depends on the answers provided to these questions. I think that we should say ‘No’ tomorrow. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, I must say that I fully share the consternation of Mr Swoboda and Mrs Weber. It is quite astounding that, after the various meetings you have been able to have and the documents you have received, you are still at this stage in acknowledging, or rather failing to acknowledge, the clear breaches that the French Government has committed in expelling the Roma. And this is not a new topic: a year ago, a group of voluntary organisations petitioned you on matters that are being raised again today, such as the failure to abide by the one month’s notice period before sending back European citizens that is enshrined in the Free Movement Directive. As regards the right to a personal examination of circumstances, I do not think you need any further expert opinions to conclude that when ‘escort to the border’ orders are handed out en masse
 in a camp, all identically addressed, this goes against the consideration of personal situations. Are six-year-old children a threat to public order? Do you really need additional proof, when justice and the French courts have judged this case and the French Government is using an extremely broad and illegitimate interpretation of a public order threat? If you need judges, experts or NGOs, we can provide you with them. However, please stop this denial of reality and this failure to fulfil your duties! The debate that took place this morning was a disgrace. We heard the leader of the European Parliament’s largest political group talking about the Roma people in connection with thefts of tractors in his local area. We heard José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, speaking during the debate on the Roma people about the security needs of European citizens. In other words, at the highest level of Europe’s political leaders, the tendency to automatically associate the Roma with crime, prostitution and trafficking is being boosted and fed. In doing so, they are placing fundamental rights and the whole point of Europe itself at stake. As Mr Cohn-Bendit said this morning: this is a test of you, Mrs Reding; this is a test of the Treaty of Lisbon, a test of your relevance. Will you be capable of proving, in this situation, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is anything other than a sham? It is down to you, it is your duty, and now is the time to proclaim this.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs in ’t Veld for her speech. At the very least, it clearly explains the reasons for her vote in favour, because from the start, in the speeches from the two large groups, I have not heard anything but smokescreens. The reality is that this agreement is not obviously any different, at least on the main points which motivated the opposition of the European Parliament in February. There are still cases of haphazard data transfer, and there is still the retention of data for five years. There is still effectively no right of recourse for European citizens on American territory, and there is the very important question raised by Mr Tavares concerning Europol. Europol is not a judicial institution, and it is not me who says that – it is the texts, the treaties. The European and national data protection supervisors are all in agreement on these essential points. As for me, I have the feeling that after having flexed our muscles – as you said, Mr De Clerck – we are now kowtowing, and this is not good news for European citizens. (Applause) Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the nine victims of the Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla, who were riddled with dozens of bullets, mostly at point-blank range and mostly in the back, could have been one of 42 nationalities, but they are nine Turkish victims. We can clearly imagine the mobilisation of the government in Turkey and the agitation of public opinion. Moreover, in the light of the actions, reactions and the pressure that Mr Erdoğan’s government is putting on the Israeli Government, today some would have us believe that this is a Turkish-Israeli issue and that it is nonetheless ultimate proof that Turkey has decided to turn its back on Europe and proof of its new foreign policy axis. Madam High Representative, I really would like you to clear up any ambiguity on this subject. It must be said loud and clear that it is a very good thing that Mr Erdoğan is being applauded by Arab public opinion because Mr Erdoğan is proving that using political instruments to act is more effective than violence and more effective than radicalism and extremism. I believe that this is a political lesson that we could encourage and support, and I call on you, Madam High Representative, to state this loud and clear. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, I would have preferred to hear from the rapporteur, Mr Tavares, but never mind; now he has finally joined us in this debate, and that is the main thing. I think that the work that he has managed to do to reach a consensus on the use of the European Refugee Fund, whose job it is to fund and encourage the Member States to develop their refugee resettlement programme, is exceptionally positive work, which Commissioner Malmström is strongly encouraging, and I am delighted to see that. We must nevertheless bear in mind a few figures, which will allow us to put the scope of this fund into perspective. If we were to allocate the entire European Refugee Fund – something that I do not want because it would inevitably be detrimental to the funding of the conditions of reception of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe – we would barely be able to resettle 20 000 refugees in Europe, a number far removed from the request of the UNHCR, which has established that there are more than 470 000 refugees worldwide in need of resettlement, that is, people who genuinely have specific needs, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and who cannot possibly return to their country of origin. We must therefore be sensible. To me, the second precaution we must take – because we have experienced this in my country, France – concerns the media coverage of the resettlement of some refugees as a tree of charity hiding a forest of malpractice, because at the same time, this country, France, has just been condemned by the United Nations Committee against Torture for returning asylum seekers to third countries where they risk facing inhumane or degrading treatment. I believe – and this is my final point – that these are the precautions that we must bear in mind. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, the Agency for Fundamental Rights reports that the Roma suffer every type of discrimination in every area, whether it be in relation to access to employment, to health care, to education or to housing. They are therefore the minority that is most discriminated against in Europe. In 2009, for example, on average, one in every four Roma was a victim of a crime against the person – specifically assaults, threats and serious harassment – on at least one occasion in the course of the previous 12 months whilst, at the same time, one in every three Roma was questioned by the police on average four times in the course of the previous 12 months. Their marginalised situation is compounded by their lack of awareness of their rights. This situation, which affects almost 10 million people at the heart of the European Union, which is now endowed with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and will soon be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, casts serious doubts over the policy of non-discrimination and effectiveness of rights, both at EU and Member State level. It took the racist violence in Italy in December 2007 to have a large-scale, high-level European mobilisation finally result in the organisation of the first European summit in September 2008. However, the call for a European Union framework strategy on the integration of the Roma, including a directive on the inclusion of the Roma, has still not seen the light of day. Member States – such as France and some others too – that maintain temporary measures for access to their markets for Bulgarians and Romanians are primarily penalising the Roma and must remove those measures as soon as possible as a sign of political goodwill. Member States must finally abandon the negotiation of bilateral readmission agreements with Kosovo, which are leading to Roma being returned to lead-contaminated camps in northern Mitrovica, as Mr Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, has been able to demonstrate. As regards the European Commission, I wish to remind it of the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2009 on the social situation of the Roma. In this year for combating poverty, I believe that we can at last decide to make the best use of our instruments and our Structural Funds with a view to resolving this serious situation.

 Mr President, firstly, I should like to welcome and congratulate Commissioner Füle. The 12th hearing of the trial of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink was held in Istanbul on Monday. For the first time, official observers at that trial felt that the court was sincerely trying to establish the truth and that the connections between this trial – that of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink – and other trials under way – such as that of the Ergenekon network – had been highlighted by the prosecutor. This fact is extremely significant because it is every political assassination, intolerance within society and the impunity that still prevails that are being put on trial here. Moreover, this is a view that the families of the victims of these political assassinations eloquently expressed when, referring to the Turkish ‘Deep State’, they declared themselves to be Hrant Dink’s ‘deep family’. I am telling you this because things are moving forward and because, within Turkish civil society, there is a desire and a movement for reform aimed at promoting democracy and rights, and this desire and this movement are exceptionally powerful. I should also like to cite another example which is making the headlines in the newspapers at the moment –family honour crimes have already been mentioned – and that is the young 16-year-old girl who was found buried in a chicken pen and who had been sentenced by the family council for having spoken to boys. This is terrifying and it is a crime. The members of that family will obviously have to be put in prison. The fact is, a few years ago, these crimes did not make the headlines. It is therefore pleasing today to see that these so-called ‘honour crimes’, which are simply barbaric crimes, are no longer being tolerated in Turkish society. Turkish society is in a state of flux, it is in turmoil even, and I think that, when we discuss Turkey, we must be keenly aware that any reform in that country deeply affects relations between citizens, the establishment, Turkish history and democracy. These are absolutely crucial elements. I believe that our process must be totally sincere. Today, the sincerity of our process is acknowledged, and it matches our ability to support the complicated, critical and historic process in Cyprus. Today, the EU must say clearly to Cyprus that we are ready to support and to guarantee, using all the means at our disposal, economic and financial means included, any agreement reached between the north and the south and that we are also determined to ensure that nothing in the body of EU law can hinder the achievement of a consensus in Cyprus. We must forge ahead; the future of Turkey’s membership of the EU is also riding on this issue. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, a question, yes, but which question? Addressed to whom and for what purpose? I believe that our delegation – of which you are a member, Mr Madlener – has committed itself and continues to firmly commit itself to human rights and gender equality and to every initiative taken to counter violence against women. I mentioned this just now in my speech. I believe that so-called honour crimes, which are crimes organised on a family or tribal basis, are utterly indefensible and that, today, it is very pleasing to see that no one in Turkey puts up with this type of archaic criminal practice any more. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, too, hope that everything is done at European level to encourage the Member States to assume their responsibilities and accommodate those Guantánamo detainees who have been proven innocent. They are victims and must be accommodated safely on European soil. Everyone knows, however, that the closure of Guantánamo will not stop questions being asked about human rights and counterterrorism, either in the United States or in Europe. In the United States, as you said, the antiterrorism law still permits unlimited pre-trial detention and trials before military courts. In Europe, well, the Guantánamo prisoners did not just fall out of the sky. I genuinely believe that there has been a failure to shed light on this subject. Mrs Hautala rightly spoke of the parliamentary investigation concluded on 22 December by Lithuania. It should be praised to the skies. It is exemplary. It must serve as an example. Conclusions were not drawn from these illegal practices on European soil, and I believe that that is the job of the European Commission; that is the job of the Council. We must draw every possible conclusion from the illegal practices which took place and which led to the opening of Guantánamo, a decision in which the Member States were fully complicit.

Mr President, I am disturbed by the speeches that I have just heard, from the Commissioner right through to my fellow Members. I feel that we really have our work cut out to gain an accurate and objective understanding of the present situation in Tunisia. Frankly, when I listen to you, I feel as though I am listening to western intellectuals talking cheerfully, many decades ago, about the economic and social success in the countries of the USSR, with a complete inability to go and see what our shared values stand for in practice in those countries. What are our shared values, Mr Michel? They are human rights, democracy and the rule of law. You have all rightly pointed out that Tunisia was our first partner to sign an association agreement. This is true, and that is why all this is very worrying, because we are not talking here about gaps, Commissioner, or about small steps. No. There is a huge, ongoing decline in human rights and democracy in Tunisia. Can you name one single newspaper, party or union that has been authorised in the last 20 years? No. The truth is that fundamental freedoms are being systematically and utterly disregarded, and, with them, our own commitments. This is not about moralising; this is about respecting the values of the European Union, and respecting the commitments that we made by signing this association agreement. Therefore, I demand that there be at least a shared analysis of this matter. I believe that we have worked hard to have this debate, but it would certainly be time better spent if we were to organise an actual delegation, one that really goes and meets this civil society in Tunisia and the various members of that society, in order to make an assessment of the continued harassment experienced by human rights defenders, students, trade unionists, workers and lawyers. There have been putsches in almost all of the associations that showed a certain degree of autonomy with regard to the authorities. I therefore believe that you are completely deluded on this matter. Having listened to your speeches, I well understand why you do not want to see the real picture in Tunisia. You do not want to see it because you believe that there are economic interests at stake, and because you believe that there are interests at stake relating to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration. You have expressed all this in the clearest of terms, and you go on about advances relating to equality between men and women and to the family, advances that date back to Bourguiba’s time. I repeat, these date back to Bourguiba. There has been no further progress since that time. I therefore believe that, if we have any respect for ourselves, for the agreements we sign, for the Neighbourhood Policy or for EU values, we certainly cannot propose an advanced status for Tunisia. Therefore, I tell you straight: if you propose that and renounce all requirements and all commitments in relation to human rights and democracy with all the countries of the Mediterranean, that will be the guaranteed outcome.

 Madam President, Commissioner Rehn, thank you for remaining with us at this late hour to discuss democratisation in Turkey, a subject on which you have done a great deal of work, for which I thank you. I believe that there were very many of us who, when the government announced its democratic initiative, its democratic opening-up, recognised just how bold a step this was and, at the same time, believed that this huge ambition represented a long road ahead, a road that would probably be full of pitfalls; the pitfalls appeared fairly quickly. The first act, as you said, was the dissolution of the DTP, but I also note that, alongside the ban on the DTP, the ban on engaging in political activity, which affects several elected members of its party, also eliminates the figures who were most heavily involved in the democratic and political dialogue to resolve the Kurdish issue. This leaves a question mark hanging over this decision. Next, there is also this wave of arrests which, today, are genuinely removing political leaders and therefore also the spokesmen on this Kurdish issue. Yet the Kurdish issue is central to the democratisation process in Turkey! Primarily because it is systemic, because it represents many years of suffering, violence, conflict and war, the tragic scars of which are still in evidence today; and these scars are also economic, social, cultural and political. This Kurdish issue is also placing a huge strain on the democratisation process. It is placing a strain on freedom of expression, on freedom of the press, on the rights of citizens and on the fight against torture. And when I see today how anti-terrorism legislation is being used as a cover for political reprisals, I say that now really is the time when we have to support the government and expect it to take another extremely ambitious initiative to emerge from this situation because, as we know, not all the established groups in Turkey are interested in a democratic settlement of the Kurdish issue. We are well aware of this fact, as we have been since the beginning. Therefore, Turkey now needs our support, our unfailing support in this process of democratisation. My fellow Member, Mrs in ’t Veld, is right to say that this unfailing support must include the renewal of that promise of membership once the democratisation process has been completed; it is absolutely crucial to say this. Next, the government will eventually have to produce reforms, which will inevitably have to lead to a new draft constitution. Immediate reforms will obviously relate to legislation on political parties. They will also relate to electoral reform – as a matter of extreme urgency – and to the independence of the judicial system. These fundamental pillars for a democratic state in Turkey must now be courageously and determinedly promoted by the Turkish Government. Moreover, this government must also implement initiatives to encourage consensus and reconciliation, because polarisation of society and of the political forces in Turkey would have a disastrous effect on the search for the consensus needed for the adoption of a new constitution, which we are all hoping for. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Malmström and the Swedish Presidency on their excellent conclusions. They revive the expectation that we all had, namely that it would be confirmed that the EU is indeed responsible for peace in the region under international law, and that, I believe, is crucial. Nevertheless, I am surprised that, one year after the military invasion of Gaza, no reference has been made, in these conclusions, to the follow-up to the Goldstone report sought by the Council. What stage are we at in the follow-up to this Goldstone report, to which the Council committed itself, notably with regard to the internal investigations involving the various parties concerned? Next, I am delighted that East Jerusalem is being considered as the capital of the future Palestinian State, or the Jerusalem of the two States. Nevertheless, these conclusions lack specific operational options. On the other hand, there are very many such options in the mission report by the Heads of State or Government who visited East Jerusalem. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to kindly clarify for us the specific methods by which, in fact, the European Union will neither recognise nor legitimise the annexation of East Jerusalem that Israel is currently seeking to achieve by, among other things, introducing economic measures, but also by orchestrating the mass displacement of Palestinian communities.

Mr President, I am talking here about so-called targeted sanctions, about intelligent sanctions, those that have a direct impact on fundamental rights too – the fundamental rights of individuals, organisations or legal bodies of any kind. These fundamental rights are important. They can include, for example, freedom of movement, but also protection of property. It is for these reasons that these targeted sanctions must comply with a number of minimum rules in terms of procedure and legal certainty. I would add, moreover, that respect for these legal and procedural rules is crucial if these targeted sanctions are to be credible and, therefore, effective. It was the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe – we in this House remember – that, through one of its then Members, Dick Marty, demanded transparency and the right of defence and which showed the absurdity of this lack of transparency where the effectiveness of listing and delisting was concerned. Listing and delisting were liable to affect innocent people too, people who were unaware of what was going on around them and unable to do anything about a situation that they generally stumbled upon by accident. That is why access to data, as mentioned by Mr Michel, communication of the grounds for listing, and protection in the transfer of personal data, are crucial elements of this procedure. Moving on, it nevertheless took a great deal of perseverance on the part of the victims of the United Nations’ and the European Union’s system of sanctions and the mobilisation of civil society, human rights organisations and also the European Parliament to have these victims’ rights recognised by the European Court of Justice. I would add that the Council’s amendments concerning blacklists depend on the proposals that have been made, including by the European Parliament. That is why the European Parliament absolutely must be involved in taking, implementing and monitoring these decisions, since history shows that it was the European Parliament that made the reform of the Council regulation possible.

 Mr President, the following is an extract from a letter written by William Bourdon, Taoufik Ben Brik’s lawyer, to Mr Sarkozy, President of the French Republic: ‘I have had the opportunity to denounce, as all his Tunisian lawyers have done, the legal farce which has resulted in Taoufik Ben Brik being sentenced, without in-depth examination, to a staggering six months in prison. I can unequivocally and formally attest to the fact that the dossier of the proceedings which led to this conviction was totally fabricated and was based on the personal vendetta of President Ben Ali. Throughout this year, 2009, he has been unable to travel since the fragility of his immune system is such that he is always at risk of being exposed to serious diseases. I believe that his family have succeeded in bringing him essential medicine, but I am not certain of this. His Tunisian lawyers have only intermittent access to their client, and some are systematically denied any possibility of visiting him. The only time that his wife has been able to see him was for a few minutes a few days ago, and she has been unable to see him again since.’ Mr President, please write to the Tunisian authorities to request the release of Taoufik Ben Brik.

Mr President, I agree, and so does my group, that the European Union’s enlargement policy is one of its most productive and most convincing policies. That is why, Mr Rehn, I am a little concerned for your future, because I am not entirely sure how you are going to be able to find a portfolio within the future Commission that is more attractive than that of enlargement. It is absolutely astounding to see what the prospect of membership can bring about as a force for change, for democracy-building, in a country such as Turkey. Yes, of course, there are still many things to achieve: the independence of the judiciary, a role for the army, freedom of expression, that all aspects of the Kurdish issue are genuinely dealt with once and for all, of course. However, I feel it is important to emphasise that this EU enlargement strategy is not just for the benefit of the countries that are going through the accession process; it is for our benefit and for the benefit of our European decision makers, too. It is irresponsible to diminish the efforts to change of a country such as Turkey by allowing doubts to remain about the outcome of the negotiation process. Yes, the outcome of the negotiation process will be that Turkey joins, and we must say so clearly. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that we are having a debate today on this issue because it is clear that the Heads of State or Government had expected the deportation of irregular migrants from the European Union to Afghanistan to be carried out without any fuss, and that is not the case. It is not the case for two reasons: firstly, because the European Commission has requested information from the United Kingdom Government and the French Government, which is a good thing, and, secondly, because we are having a debate on this subject today. Questions have already been asked. Is Afghanistan a safe country? Well, we should ask Mr Obama that, as he has just decided to send 34 000 soldiers there. No army is able to guarantee the survival of its men in Afghanistan, and are we supposed to be able to guarantee that the lives of the migrants that we send back to that country will not be endangered? This situation is a joke, and the UNHCR is not putting up with it either, as it has warmly recommended to the Member States that they do not proceed with deportations of this kind. Secondly, there is ambiguity surrounding collective expulsions. Everyone – and I most of all – welcomes the future binding character of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 19(1): ‘Collective expulsions are prohibited’. You tell us that this is not a collective expulsion. Mr Billström has a charming way of putting it, since he tells us that this is a reasonable mobilisation of resources. Soon, common charter flights are going to be sold to us in the same way as car pooling to combat global warming is. There are limits! And what are those limits? Well, I can tell you, as an elected representative from Pas-de-Calais, where there are many Afghans – who have given rise, moreover, to these deportations organised by Mr Besson in France – that, when the French Government decides, for communication purposes, to organise a collective return operation and to turn it into a media event, there are arrests in Pas-de-Calais: collective arrests, which are therefore illegal because they are discriminatory. Therefore, we absolutely cannot guarantee what you are saying, Mr Barrot, namely, that this is a joint operation for people who, following individual assessments, have been found to be irregular migrants. This is indeed a case of collective expulsion because there was a collective arrest. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, on Thursday, I was in Tunis for the trial of the poet and writer Taoufik Ben Brik, indicted in Tunisia on obscure common-law charges that fool no one. Since the ‘elections’ in Tunisia, held on 25 October, those who defend human rights have been subjected to an outburst of violence and harassment on such a scale as I have never before witnessed, familiar though I am with that country. On 25 October, President Ben Ali no doubt realised the full extent of the Tunisian people’s disaffection with their leader; and the embassies and the European Commission, which unfortunately does not have the political visa to attend this kind of trial, have displayed a general lack of interest in the issue that is unfolding. I think we must be very clear today. We are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue. What is stopping the embassies and the European Commission from rigorously questioning Mr Ben Ali – in the name of our binding agreements and mutual commitments with Tunisia – about his actions, which are entirely contrary to those commitments? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, something very simple is going to happen for our European Parliament with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon; we are going to have another 18 MEPs from 12 Member States of the European Union. We have been prudent because, in March of this year, the European Parliament asked all the Member States to anticipate this result by stating, as the method of appointment, that the elections on 7 June would be the democratic basis for sending these additional eighteen MEPs. Some Member States did so, like Spain and your country, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Other countries, which nonetheless state that they are very content, as am I, with the result of the Irish referendum and are keen to see the Treaty of Lisbon implemented, have still not done their duty, as far as their own will is concerned, by stating their method of appointment. Can we count on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to ask each Member State at the European Council on 29 and 30 October to state the method of appointment of these additional MEPs under the Treaty of Lisbon? The second thing that really shocks me is that everyone is talking about the grand ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it imposes an obligation on us in connection with one very simple thing: equality between men and women. This is a binding objective of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the Treaty of Lisbon. I understand that, for the additional two posts which remain to be filled, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and the President of the Council, only men’s names are being circulated. Your country, Sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question. I expect you to take this extremely seriously. It is not possible for us to only have men in the four major positions of responsibility in Europe. It is not worthy of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not worthy of Europe. I am counting on you to ensure that equality between men and women is respected at this level also. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, the last time we held a debate after a tragedy in the Mediterranean was on 1 April. You will recall that many hundreds of migrants perished off the Libyan coast. We had called for an investigation. To date we have received no information concerning the circumstances of that tragedy. Since then, as you know, in mid-August, 73 Africans were found dead off Lampedusa. On 25 August, 57 Eritrean migrants were finally rescued after a lengthy spell in Maltese waters. On 31 August, 75 Somalis were refused entry to Libya. Really, the external borders of the European Union have become murderous. This is the title of a report due out by the NGO ‘Migreurop’, which I invite all of you, ladies and gentlemen, to obtain and to read assiduously. Confronted with this situation, Mr Barrot, you refer to some key issues. You refer to the right of asylum, to the right to international protection. You should also refer to the right of any person to leave any country, and to the obligation placed on everyone to help others, whoever they may be. This is international maritime law. These situations are on the increase, and they are also occurring more and more at the border between Turkey and Greece. This is why I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that strengthening Frontex’s resources will be the answer to this situation. I believe that the European Union, today, is up against its own project. The European Union was born out of the refusal to deny others their dignity, and it is to this that it must remain true. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, this gives me an opportunity to clarify two small points which, I believe – and as one of my fellow Members said just now – highlight the hypocritical nature of our policy. The first point concerns the Dublin agreements. Commissioner, you know the situation in Calais well; you know that, in Calais, many people could easily apply for and obtain political refugee status. Why do they not do so? Because, as a result of the Dublin agreements, they are guaranteed to be sent to countries to which they do not want to go, and sometimes for excellent reasons. They do not want to go to Greece, where they have practically no chance of receiving refugee status. Today, the Dublin agreements are an instrument that is hostile to the protection of those people who need them most and which create inequality among the Member States. So let us stop talking about solidarity, when instruments are put in place that create inequality among the States. The second point concerns the readmission agreements. I fully understand, the aim is to negotiate these agreements with Turkey and with Libya, that is, to toy with the idea of having one huge environment of countries that are our neighbours and huge camps for holding the migratory flows. This is unacceptable for practical reasons, for moral reasons and for political reasons, and you know it, Mr Barrot! Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have a problem which means that I am not going to vote for you tomorrow, but you know what it is, since my group has explained it well. It is a political issue. You do not have a project for transforming Europe environmentally and socially. And yet that is, I believe, what needs to be done today. However, as Mr Daul elegantly put it, it was the right that won the elections, therefore you are on the right. The situation is clear. I should like, however, to be able to have respect for the President of the Commission, but I have a problem with this: when I see you, I inevitably think – and I assure you this is true – of your responsibility in the CIA’s secret flights. Between 2002 and 2006, 728 people were transferred to Guantánamo via Portuguese airspace. You were minister from 2002 to 2004. I therefore cannot believe you, Mr Barroso, when you make declamations about Europe being a champion of human rights. What I expect from you – what I hope for from you, because I would like, in the future, to respect you as President of the Commission – is not your memoirs, in however many years’ time, but that you will acknowledge your responsibilities in this serious act, which casts a shadow over European values.Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 This report on small-scale coastal fishing, artisanal fishing and the reform of the common fisheries policy is important because it underlines the importance of ‘small-scale’ fishing in the EU, particularly in terms of job creation, regional diversity and development, and because it marks Parliament’s general refusal to privatise access to fish stocks, refers to the need for a flexible definition of artisanal fishing (what is small-scale in the Netherlands is not small-scale in Greece) and supports the application of environmental and social criteria for determining access to fisheries resources and market distortion. However, the final version of the motion for a resolution crosses a line of acceptability in advocating support to cover sudden short-term increases in fuel prices. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is firmly opposed to support of this kind. I therefore abstained from the vote. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution, as it does not sufficiently address gender parity. One of its recommendations is that the Member States should propose both a male and a female candidate for the post of Commissioner, which is a positive step However, there is no requirement for gender parity in the drawing-up of lists or in the final results, even though this is of vital importance considering that only 30 % of MEPs are women.

 This resolution consents to the amendment of the Annexes to the Protocols to the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel.

 After a heated debate on shale gas extraction, and a great deal of back and forth in the Chamber, during which, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I expressed my strong opposition and outlined the concerns of developing countries, particularly in terms of land grabbing and access to water, fertile soil and food, which potentially call into question their food sovereignty. Today we voted on the two reports of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE Committee) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, at last adopting an EP position on this highly controversial subject. Although the ITRE report was in favour of shale gas, totally irresponsible and unacceptable, Mr Sonik’s report was more open to discussion. In the end, I abstained in the final vote on this report. The reasons are simple: on the one hand, this report rightly favours the adaptation of the European regulations, and demonstrates the EP’s desire to provide a framework for fracturing and to respond to the challenges; on the other hand, the moratorium, or more precisely the proposed amendment urging the Member States not to authorise any further hydraulic fracturing in the EU, was rejected. In any event, I am completely opposed to shale gas extraction. Catherine Grèze,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development
. − (FR)
 Madam President, I am absolutely against the extraction of shale gas. These are matters that go way beyond our European borders with appalling effects on our water resources. Imagine yourselves what the consequences could be, and how devastating they could be, in developing countries where access to water is vital. But the extraction of shale gas is also about land grabbing and poor land quality; in other words, it brings into question food sovereignty in many countries. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, despite the publicity, despite the brazen lobbying that has been carried out even at the very door of the hemicycle, I would urge you to shoulder your responsibilities. We need a binding legal framework for European businesses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Catherine Grèze,

 Madam President, Mr Szymański, are you really asking me to choose between the lesser of two evils? It is like choosing between the plague and cholera. Allow me to ask in return whether you are aware that in a large number of developing countries there is no water? Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, what an honour to have to reply to all of these questions! Regarding the point about which developing countries are carrying out research on shale gas extraction, as far as I know countries including South Africa and Morocco have already undertaken some research. But you can reply on multinationals the world over to seek out the last drop of a resource wherever it may be. On the issue of water, raised by my colleague, and the impact on water resources, it seems we have different sources of information. I saw an excellent film, Gasland
, which is worth seeing, and which showed the truly dramatic consequences, no pun intended, on water resources and human and animal health in the United States, which as you know is a highly developed and technologically advanced country. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) has become a very important subject in the debate on EU development policy. The Treaty of Lisbon makes eradication of poverty an overall goal of EU development policy (Article 21) and, with the aim of achieving this goal, states the need for a coherent approach in terms of EU external action, covering trade, agriculture, fisheries, climate change and tax havens (Article 208). Unfortunately, the report in question is not an evaluation of implementation of PCD or its weaknesses. Rather, it is a report on what PCD should be. There are positive elements in the report, such as recognition of the right of developing countries to define their own policies by democratic means and to protect their economy. However, I could not allow myself, in the name, indeed, of genuine Policy Coherence for Development, to vote in favour of a resolution that encourages the expansion of agri-fuels in developing countries and supports agro-industry. That contributes towards land grabbing and runs wholly contrary to the notion of food sovereignty. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

This text rejects the arbitrary cuts proposed by the Member States for the 2013 budget. In its proposal, which Parliament supports, the Commission called for an increase in payments in order to meet budgetary commitments and outstanding payments from previous years. I abstained in the vote, however, because it supports the funding for the ITER nuclear fusion programme, a pipe dream that is a money pit for the European budget. At the same time, the report calls for cuts in certain lines, including some that are linked to development cooperation. I also voted in favour of amendments that sought to use the nuclear funds to finance programmes to dismantle plants, though these were rejected. I abstained on the amendments calling for a reduction in the subsidies for tobacco production. These reductions would have a severe impact on small farmers. Unless we call for a ban on the production and marketing of tobacco, this reduction would be counterproductive. Finally, I abstained, too, on the amendments calling for a single seat for the European Parliament. We need to have a real debate on that subject, not just a few amendments, as is the case here.

I voted for this report, which emphasises the European Parliament’s strong and united position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the years 2014-2020 in the run-up to the November European Council on this issue. The report reiterates our support for a 5 % increase in the budget in relation to 2013, that is to say, an additional EUR 100 billion. The multiannual financial framework is Europe’s only way out of the current crisis. Given the stakes, it must be up to the task and it must finance the commitments made by all of the European institutions, particularly in the areas of climate, development assistance, research, employment and the fight against poverty. In addition to the issue of the percentage, the other main problem is that of the EU’s own resources. In that regard, too, Parliament sets out a united position in favour of the creation of new own resources, such as the Financial Transaction Tax. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The European Parliament has just approved the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA), which will be annexed to the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel. This agreement, as adopted, does not guarantee that the products that arrive on our market will not be partly manufactured in the settlements, contrary to the provisions of European and international law. Let us not forget that the European Union condemns Israel’s settlement policy, which it considers to be illegal, and that it decided in 2009 to suspend any upgrade of relations with Israel (following the launch of Operation Cast Lead against Gaza). We are therefore sending out mixed messages, which are contradictory and difficult to understand. It is for this reason that I voted against the adoption of the agreement. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted in favour of the report by Charles Goerens on the future of development policy as it seems to me to be positive on the whole. The aim of the report is to refocus the discussion on the priority aspects of development policy, in particular the criteria for public development aid, independent strategic reflection, the issue of differentiation (emerging countries) and aid for local trade. I am particularly happy about the positive vote on the paragraph introduced by the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the Committee on Development, which aims to refocus aid for trade facilitation instruments, which currently targets the export sectors, so that it also supports local and regional trade.

 Until now, the number of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of energy is unknown, as Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of such agreements. According to the Commission, Member States are becoming increasingly obliged to accept regulatory concessions, which is incompatible with European law on the matter. In addition, as the Commission does not know exactly how much energy is being imported, it cannot provide for market fluctuations or the means to alleviate them. Consequently, the Commission has proposed to put in place an information exchange mechanism with regard to energy agreements with third countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tried to strengthen the proposal by allowing the Commission to have access to agreements before they are signed, in order to be able to advise Member States on their compatibility with the law. Such a measure would also strengthen transparency. The Member States did not want this, and the rapporteur did not seem to care, preferring a bad agreement to no agreement on the subject at all. I personally voted against this text. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently three quality labels for agricultural products in the European Union (protected geographical indications (PGI), protected designations of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG)). The Commission wishes to reform this system in order to simplify or facilitate new entries, in particular. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it was important to take advantage of this overhaul to promote the introduction of a new ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label. We also called for the introduction of a ‘mountain’ label to highlight the considerable added value of products from these regions, where agriculture is often traditional and extensive. These two measures were passed during the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we are pleased about that. However, during the negotiations in trialogue with the Council and the Commission, the Members representing Parliament sacrificed the ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label, which is nonetheless important for encouraging these kinds of agricultural practices. That is why I voted against this text, which was initially encouraging. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Although the free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia/Peru should be ratified shortly, Parliament has just voted on a text establishing safeguard clauses for the banana sector. The safeguard clauses enable us to temporarily reinstitute normal customs duties or to suspend tariff liberalisation. The text recognises that there are problems in terms of employment rights in the countries concerned, although this recognition is not sufficient. The rapporteur also calls for greater consideration of social and environmental aspects within the framework of the forthcoming economic liberalisation. The Commission must understand this message. Moreover, the texts clearly state the need for greater consideration of overseas countries, where bananas are a pillar of the economy. This vote should not make us forget that the real issue for these regions is a transition towards a more diversified and more sustainable economy. For all of these reasons, I voted in favour of this report. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The matter at issue here is the future of the seas. The Salavrakos report deserves to be supported for its long-term perspective on the sustainable development of fishing in the EU, but we cannot allow it to be watered down in this way. I shall explain what I mean by this: Amendment 2, which was adopted with the help of the regionalists who swung the vote, has destroyed the call to allow fish stocks to increase to levels above those capable of producing a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This means that the EU has failed to meet even the requirements of international law. I therefore ended up voting against this text, for, although it does take account of some important aspects (ceilings for the renewal of fleet, areas for repopulating fish), it does not take sufficient account of numerous points including overfishing and the objectives set by the common fisheries policy.

 The Commission is proposing that Member States grant decoupled support to vine growers under the direct payments scheme. In practical terms, that will allow Member States to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the common agricultural policy (CAP) direct payments scheme (first pillar). That is positive, as the payments will now be granted for an indefinite period, which will allow small farmers to predict their incomes over the period and therefore gain stability. The introduction of this mechanism will, however, require some adjustments. This resolution will allow Member States to test this new mechanism for a period of one year prior to its definitive implementation, if they so desire. That is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this resolution which makes recommendations for improving animal welfare in Europe. Despite the fact that unfortunately it does not call clearly for a reduction in transport time, it does limit the duration of transport of live animals to eight hours as requested in a recent petition on this matter.

 The Council conclusions are mixed. Symbolically, they point towards greater solidarity and integration, the only means of tackling this interminable economic crisis, which is a good thing. However, only around 10 billion of the 120 initially promised by the Compact for Growth and Jobs are genuinely new and additional funds. Furthermore, the conclusions still have ‘growth’ as their leitmotiv. This is seen as the sole remedy to all our economic ills. This rhetoric is unacceptable as far as we, as ecologists, are concerned. What we should be questioning is our model of development as a whole and we should bear in mind the fact that resources are finite. The conclusions of the Summit do not do this, or do it very little.

 I signed this resolution calling for all public consultations to be translated into all of the languages recognised by the countries of the European Union. There is a European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that calls for resolute action to be taken to promote these languages, to prohibit any form of discrimination against them and even to facilitate and encourage their use in public life. This resolution responds precisely to this last point. Such a measure would encourage citizens to address the European Union. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 We have been asked to express an opinion on reprioritising our development cooperation with Latin America. I voted in favour of Mr Cortés Lastra’s report as it highlights the need to move towards renewed cooperation with Latin America. This is a chance for the EU to stop with the neoliberal policies of the past. Promoting growth does not provide prosperity for all. Social cohesion is key to this process. Growth and the fight against poverty cannot be systematically linked. The EP will soon be questioned about its approval of the free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru and on the association agreement with Central America. They go completely against the objectives of our development policy. The European Commission has always mistakenly interpreted development policy through the prism of international trade. It is time we turned this logic on its head and focused mainly on coherent development policies in any agreement. The report rightly points out the need for all EU policies to be coherent and for systematic compliance with environmental and social standards, while including civil society.

 As regards this road map for energy cooperation with third countries, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance succeeded in having a number of amendments incorporated, notably on reducing dependence on imports through greater input from renewable energies, the need to align the long-term climate and energy policy objectives, the need to ensure sustainable energy supply at local level in developing countries, and the need to be more sceptical about the use of agrofuels.

 I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe as it was essential for us to send out a strong message against the homophobic laws that have been recently adopted, or are in the process of being adopted in certain countries, particularly at the very heart of Europe, where homosexuality is criminalised. The European Parliament, as a great defender of fundamental rights, had a duty to examine and condemn these extremely worrying laws that demonstrate the increasing homophobia that can be seen today in Europe. It is utterly scandalous that the authorities should justify these laws by saying that they are necessary to protect public morality, while they restrict freedom of expression and are totally discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. How is it possible to consider demonstrations, support for, or the mere acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as ‘homosexual propaganda’? For the first time since the last European elections, all of the main political groups have come to an agreement: we are saying ‘no to homophobic laws’ and we clearly condemn any discrimination, hate speech or violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

 We had the opportunity to prevent the disappearance of bluefin tuna, and the EU, the main exploiter of this species, also had the opportunity to assume its responsibilities. It is regrettable, however, that the European Parliament did not succeed in adopting more ambitious measures to address the plight of this iconic endangered species. The new legislation, which I certainly could not vote against, is only the bare minimum, but it will at least make it possible to enforce existing international standards. Although the European Union has just complied with the commitments made within the framework of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), we are still far from taking the necessary measures. Measures should have been taken, for example, to close zones to fishing, especially during the spawning season. In addition, stricter measures should have been adopted concerning illegal fishing and overfishing in particular, in order to fill certain gaps, which are currently exacerbating the problem of the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It may not be too late, and the EU will once again have the opportunity to enforce more stringent regulations this November. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this report recommending the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) at EU level and therefore supporting the draft directive presented by the Commission last September. The FTT is an excellent instrument for raising new revenue to finance stimulus policies. It is one of the best ways of going beyond the austerity policies that are leading Europe straight into disaster, driving too many of Europe’s citizens into poverty and leading to political and democratic stalemate, the magnitude of which is still not being acknowledged by some. However, I regret that the European Parliament has granted an exemption to pension funds. It is the wrong signal, especially since these funds – which are long-term investors – are only marginally affected by the tax, which mostly penalises short-term players. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Amazonian countries are confronted with illegal mining, which is synonymous with the ecological and social violation of indigenous territories, with tragic consequences. At the end of August, Survival
, an NGO, provided information concerning the massacre by miners of several dozen Yanomami Indians on Venezuelan territory. Today, however, the Venezuelan Government believes there to be no evidence. Since then, voices have been raised, including that of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, denouncing the lack of will on the part of local authorities to conduct an investigation and calling for an in-depth investigation. I hope that the European Union will expressly call on the Venezuelan Government to shed light on this tragedy to the fullest extent. However, those of us who are directly concerned, through our overseas territories, send a strong message calling for the full recognition of the rights of indigenous people. Starting today, let us put an end to the illegal exploitation of mineral and forest resources. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 days ago, we were hoping that Rio+20 would be the summit that would destabilise those who profit from greater inequality and deplete our resources. We are bitterly disappointed at the lack of binding objectives. However, this should not divert us from our commitments. If we want to see future progress in the negotiations, we need to prove that the fight against poverty and for sustainable development is the true objective of EU development policy, and we need to do so through the allocation of ambitious financial resources. Let us make a commitment to implement, without delay, innovative financing mechanisms, such as the financial transaction tax, and to redirect a substantial proportion of revenues towards development aid. Let us fight more effectively against tax havens and their hoarding of the fiscal resources of those countries through the excessive use made of them by transnational corporations and, in particular, the extractive industries. Only then can we become credible advocates of sustainable development for all. Eva Joly,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some satisfaction that I present this report on tax and development to you tonight. It represents an important stage in a battle that began a long time ago, which I am now pursuing in the European Parliament. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Development, with whom the work has been extremely productive. I hope that it will find confirmation during tomorrow’s votes. Developing countries have been very badly hit by the financial and economic crisis and the rising prices of agricultural materials and now need substantial new sources of funding more than ever. Amid this context of global crisis, tax revenue, which is the oldest source of development funding, is a major issue and a genuine challenge. Effective taxation systems not only provide funding for vital public services. By promoting the transparent, responsible use of government revenue, they are also one of the foundations of a responsible democracy. Contributing towards raising equitable, progressive and transparent taxes should in no way lead to removing or reducing official development assistance (ODA). It should not provide a further excuse for Member States that are increasingly inclined to reduce their share of GDP which is devoted to ODA. Whilst ODA may be imperfect and have much room for improvement, it is no less vital for countries that have been severely affected by both economic and climate-related crises. It is not a question of replacing aid, therefore, but of redirecting it towards developing effective taxation systems, to which the multinationals must contribute on the basis of their actual profits. In this way, poor countries will be able to take ownership of their development once again, reduce poverty and compensate for the loss of customs revenue caused by the liberalisation of the markets, so that in the long term, they will be able to manage without foreign aid. However, the countries of the South are not only victims of their own ineffective taxation systems. They are also victims of the tax dumping imposed by the Bretton Woods bodies, of the cost of illicit capital flight, and of tax havens. Every year, they sustain colossal losses of tax revenue estimated at over ten times the amount of aid they receive from rich countries. This report emphasises this fact. As for the OECD guidelines, far from being adequate, they actually pose a threat. By allowing non-cooperative jurisdictions to be taken off the grey lists simply by signing cooperation agreements without imposing any automatic exchange of information, they are creating the illusion that tax havens are legitimate and conferring credibility on a system that is harmful to public finances in North and South alike. Putting an end to tax havens is a vital step towards these countries’ development, and the European Union must make it an absolute priority. The EU must shoulder its responsibilities as the United States has done and produce clear, binding legislation coupled with genuine sanction mechanisms in order to put an end to tax havens, which are like weapons of mass destruction for the development of poor countries. The EU must prevent profit and transfer price manipulation by companies, especially European companies, which both benefit from and abuse detrimental taxation systems. It must impose the introduction of a transparent, binding international mechanism that will place a duty on all multinational companies, especially those in the extractive industries, to automatically declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. This is a vital first step towards stopping those who are getting rich on the back of the Southern countries’ misery. It is also a vital step towards restoring the European Union’s credibility.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these partnership agreements between the European Union, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo should, in principle, turn out to be good news for these populations, and good news for biodiversity. However, this is only one stage in a long process which the European Parliament will follow closely. If we want this agreement to allow for the introduction of a regulated, transparent and environmentally friendly timber trade which benefits local populations, rather than a few groups of dubious legality, the European Union must ensure that the rights of the local and indigenous populations are fully respected and that the latter actually participate in the consultations. It must help strengthen the capabilities of all those involved; it must contribute to the fight against corruption and to the introduction of real forest governance. The agreements must not be a pretext for continuing to pillage the natural resources of developing countries. Rather, they must help restore a balance in relations between the European Union and these countries. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, following our visit to Gaza from 26-28 May 2010, our delegation unanimously called for an immediate, total and permanent lifting of the blockade imposed by Israel. Our joint resolution was born out of this unanimity faced with this humanitarian and political tragedy, and I hope that a large majority will vote for it. Conveying our message with one voice is not just necessary, it is vital, because it is precisely unity that the European Union has lacked until now and it is precisely unity that it needs today in order to carry weight and to make its presence felt as a major and credible actor for peace. For Europe, the worst thing would be if the flotilla tragedy were to be followed by indifference and inaction caused by a lack of unity. There needs to be a political reaction by Europe. It no longer simply has the right, but the duty, to act and hold talks as well as to condemn and impose sanctions when peace is threatened by one side or the other. Madam High Representative, we have a huge responsibility today. We can no longer content ourselves with reconstructing buildings time and again. We must build peace and we must do so now. That demands courage and firmness. You must build alliances, with the United States and Turkey in particular, and you must not relieve the diplomatic pressure on Israel until the complete lifting of the blockade and the setting up of an independent international inquiry become a reality. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to Mr Domenici’s efforts, the report on which we have to take a final vote this week is a high quality document. I sincerely hope that it will be adopted on Wednesday at our plenary sitting. Many of the advances that it contains on the issues of financial transparency, fiscal policy and the fight against tax havens, the major consequences of which are rightly stressed here, are simply without precedent. First, we should welcome the fact that the text acknowledges the considerable limits of the fight against tax havens as it has been carried out until now. Tax treaties and the OECD lists of non-cooperative jurisdictions, to reproduce the terms officially in use, are unsatisfactory and even represent part of the problem that they are meant to be solving. That is why the proposals in this report, which aim to go beyond this approach, to adopt a new definition of tax havens and to introduce new tools – including sanctions − to help in this fight are hugely important. This is obviously the case for the proposal to introduce automatic exchange of tax information, both within the European Union and at international level. It is also the case for country-by-country accounting, which the report is demanding and which will make it possible to measure the real activities of companies in the countries in which they are established and to verify that they do indeed pay the taxes which they legitimately owe there. These are two fundamental demands which have long been supported by many experts. We can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is adopting them and, in so doing, will become one of the institutions that is most involved in this fight. Ladies and gentlemen, the problem of tax havens is not a mere technical issue. It relates to fundamental choices. Do we wish to give developing countries the means to benefit from their own resources instead of seeing these confiscated? Do we wish to ensure that all of our companies and our fellow citizens contribute within their means to the financing of civic life? By voting for Mr Domenici’s report, we will be giving a positive answer to these two questions. An answer of which, I believe, we can only be proud. On a personal level, I would like to thank Mr Kovács for the seminar that we jointly organised in Brussels on 9 December to put this subject on the agenda. Thank you and good luck. Eva Joly,

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this new humanitarian crisis that Haiti is enduring is perhaps on a greater scale than all previous ones, so much so that I doubt that it is possible to find the right words to talk about the victims, to speak to the survivors and to reach out to families in order to tell them how much we share their pain and are aware of our responsibility. However violent the earthquake was, it alone does not explain the extent of the damage. The latter is also linked to the chronic poverty that Haiti has endured for many years. Until now, the international community has been incapable of changing anything there. Worse, by imposing policies on Haiti that we now know did not work, international institutions, Europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric, its economy and its institutions. In the 1970s, Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned. It used to produce 90% of its agricultural needs. Today, it imports more than half. This must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production. Before this earthquake, Haiti was a country without resources because it was deprived of the resources to which it was entitled. We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies. From this point of view, we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place. In future, we must improve our procedures. However, we must, above all, be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong. We must proceed by calling our own methods into question, and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term. The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti, and the Member States have done the same. We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term, and EUR 200 million for long-term needs. I would like to compare these figures to other figures, to the USD 155 billion that the banks of the City and Wall Street are getting ready to pay to a few thousand people who work in the banks. That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level. Urgent humanitarian aid is necessary, but it alone is not enough. It must not, under any circumstances, supplant development aid, which itself must not be experienced by the countries that are supposed to benefit from it as a veritable diktat. The first way of assisting countries in great difficulty is to continue to respect them, to allow them to benefit from their own resources. We must cancel Haiti’s debt and pay off our debt to that country. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head. (Applause) Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face: the economic and financial crisis, the social or food crisis, climate change, energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty. The dominant economic model that is the unbridled free market, and our lifestyles, have not just shown their limitations, but have actually caused these unprecedented multidimensional crises. We must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies. The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision. The main imperative to respect is consistency. European Union trade policy, fisheries and agriculture must be designed consistently and in such a way as to ensure sustainable development, to fight poverty and guarantee a decent standard of living and income for everyone. I am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today. By making trade an end in itself, and not a means to serve its development policy, the European Union is sacrificing the populations of developing countries for the benefit of its multinationals. Therefore, negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements are quite rightly causing controversy amongst the governments of the ACP, unions and civil society, which see them as a threat to their economies. Agriculture is one of the most problematic issues and remains tragically neglected in cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries. Although rural areas and this sector represent more than 60% of the population and their jobs, their share of the European funds for ACP countries is virtually non-existent. This must change. How can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority? Agriculture must be at the heart of the European Union’s development policies. Helping developing countries together with local farmers to ensure they have food sovereignty is quite simply essential, all the more so because, today, food sovereignty, like the democratic legitimacy of these countries’ governments, is threatened by a new and particularly worrying phenomenon, the acquisition of arable land by foreign investors following the rise in food prices in 2007. China, Saudi Arabia and even Qatar now own thousands of hectares in developing countries. The European Union and the ACP countries must tackle this matter, which is likely to create violent conflicts and hunger riots, in particular, by making access to natural resources such as land and water a fundamental and inalienable right of local populations. Another matter that is close to my heart is that of tax havens. The repercussions of these are bad enough for developed countries, but are even worse for the economies and the political institutions of developing countries. The illicit financial flows that they allow are thought to account for as much as ten times the amount of official development assistance. Stopping this haemorrhage is a question of consistency and credibility. A first step could be the signing of a binding agreement, requiring multinationals to automatically declare their profits and the taxes paid in every country in which they operate, thus limiting the abuses and the losses sustained by developing countries. Finally, I would like to use this debate to stress once more the democratic deficit of this revision, which our parliaments were not consulted on. The role of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly must, however, be strengthened. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the negotiators will seize the opportunity they are being given to make the necessary amendments to this partnership and to make it a success of which the principal beneficiaries will be the populations of the ACP countries. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Cotonou agreements, poverty has not subsided. We have therefore failed in our development mission. Something has to change with this second revision. I am pleased to say that there is a fairly broad consensus on the measures that I am proposing, and I think that one of the measures that we can use to eradicate poverty is to really combat tax havens, and to use this instrument to do what we can. Within the European Union and in the ACP region, we can force multinationals to declare, on a country-by-country basis, how much they earn and how much tax they pay. That is also an international demand. However, many years will go by before this demand is met at international level. So let us use the opportunities that we have within this agreement to establish this rule in Europe. This is why I am asking you to reject the proposed amendment to paragraph 16, but to preserve the initial wording, which calls on us to put our own house in order. In the same vein, what we can do is also force our own investment bank to take action with regard to tax havens. We should prohibit European Development Fund investments in companies that do not make profits in the countries in which they operate, but prefer to make profits in tax havens. This was the case in Zambia, where very substantial investments – to the tune of USD 46 million, I believe – were made in the Mopani mine, for example. This has done nothing to improve the lives of Zambians; rather, it has improved the lives of the shareholders who have benefited from this aid. It is therefore totally counterproductive. This is within our power. We can change the mandate of our bank. Let us therefore do what we can and put nothing off until tomorrow. Let us take action in this regard. Then, there are principles to which we should remain totally committed: human rights and migrant rights, and I urge you to retain my proposed wording of Article 31 and not quell the protests against bilateral agreements which, in reality, constitute an outsourcing of migratory flows. (Applause) Eva Joly,

Mr President, Mr Carlgren, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the world’s future will be at stake in Copenhagen, but before that, it is the credibility of the European Union, as the global leader in the fight against global warming, that will be at stake at the end of October in Brussels. The Member States must make climate-related financing proposals that are proportionate for a tragic situation. Together with the commitment – which I hope will be ambitious – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the issue of financing and of reducing and adapting to climate change in developing countries will represent a major theme in the forthcoming negotiations. The figures speak for themselves: 100 countries, most of them poor, account for only 3% of global emissions. Although developing countries have contributed the least to these greenhouse gas emissions, they are already the worst affected. According to a recent report by Oxfam, 26 million people have already been forced to migrate due to the effects of climate change or other forms of environmental damage. By 2050, these climate refugees could number more than 200 million. The effects of climate change could destroy the progress made in some developing countries and could quite simply prevent the Millennium Development Goals from being achieved. This is therefore not a question of charity. It is a question of us accepting our full responsibility and laying the foundations for a fair and peaceful world. The European Union’s current strategy is unworthy of the ambitions declared by the leaders of environmental diplomacy. It must lay its cards on the table now in order to relaunch the negotiations. The Union cannot reasonably pledge less than EUR 35 billion in public finances. It goes without saying that these funds can only supplement those already pledged for official development assistance, all the more so because the commitments made in this area are not always honoured by our Member States. Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our planet is in our hands. If we do not stop the damage being done to our environment and the inequalities, we can fear the worst. We have a choice between an ambitious and proactive Europe and a timid Europe that is aligned with the United States, which cares little about the fate of developing countries. I urge you to make the right choice. Eva Joly,

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, democracy and human rights are inextricably linked. It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised. We must therefore welcome the fact that, on 19 May, the Council indicated that the European Union had to adopt a more consistent approach to democratic governance. The efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a striking example of this. Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock. Where is the European Union’s consistency and credibility when its own decisions contrast so sharply with its much-vaunted principles? And what can be said of the Member States that refuse to endorse the Goldstone report? Its conclusions are fair and balanced, and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace. It is this hope that the major powers are destroying, and they are destroying it through their lack of courage and their lack of loyalty to their own values. Organising election observation missions is therefore not enough, especially when one refuses afterwards to acknowledge the result. We must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues. The Council should swiftly adopt a programme of action along these lines, with the creation of a genuine strategy for human rights, which would be imperative at all levels of the EU. We need to outline our priorities clearly and integrate them formally into all of our instruments: foreign policy, human rights policy and development policy. What kind of monitoring will we carry out in those third countries in which the European Union observes the elections in order to ensure respect for political pluralism and the involvement of civil society in the long term? What are our demands as regards the establishment of an independent judiciary and of institutions that are transparent and accountable to their citizens? The persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive. It is time to clear this up if we want the European Union and its most fundamental values to be taken more seriously at international level. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we wish the following phrase to be added to point A:  ‘as well as on the developing countries’, so that this reads ‘to analyse and evaluate the extent of the social, economic and financial crisis, its impact on the Union and its Member States, as well as on the developing countries’. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

– Mr President, we also want to include a reference to ‘development cooperation’ so the sentence reads: ‘To analyse and evaluate the current implementation of Community legislation in all the areas concerned, including development cooperation’.

Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea. The violence that was used against the opponents and, in particular, women, is utterly appalling and unacceptable. I wish to express my support for the victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones’ remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre. In addition to the current measures being initiated by the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the Guinean Government by rejecting the Report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Guinea, which we will vote on during the next plenary session. The Committee on Development already unanimously rejected, in September, this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea, expressing doubts over the use of the funds allocated by the European Union. Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population, the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims’ wounds are still fresh. Doing so would send out the wrong message to the Guinean Government. It would be a scandal which I cannot bring myself to endorse. Eva Joly,

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, while I have the pleasure of putting this oral question to you on behalf of the Committee on Development, sadly I do not have the pleasure of presenting you with the resolution on the same subject, adopted unanimously by this committee. My colleagues from the Committee on Development and I worked tirelessly to ensure that the resolution was voted on and debated in plenary before the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. However, apart from my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, no other political group supported our request to put this resolution on the agenda, and yet it is vital if we want the European Parliament to play more of a part in defining the European Union’s external policy and to have real strength behind its proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, of what benefit will it be to us to vote on this resolution, which was to put the European Parliament’s requests and proposals to the members of the G20 and, more specifically, to those of our Member States who sit on it, as well as to the European Commission, at the October plenary session, that is, after the Pittsburgh Summit? Besides the fact that this devalues the work accomplished, we cannot be content with this role of current affairs commentator either. That is not our job. Let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism: journalists. Developing countries need us now more than ever. While our fellow citizens have not been spared, the global economic and financial crisis has had a far more lasting effect on the populations of developing countries. However, the financial institutions have not made these populations the main beneficiaries of the emergency loans, since very few of them satisfy the required conditions. The countries of Africa have thus received only 1.6% of the loans granted by the IMF since the last G20 meeting in London and the increase in the IMF’s resources. The rest has gone to developed countries, European ones in particular. Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course, but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility. Public development aid must be increased as a matter of urgency. Already, most of the Member States do not meet the conditions required by the OECD since 1970, and we are facing new emergencies without having new funds. We must therefore find new sources of funding, not least by reforming the current system. The Committee on Development is asking you to take action to eradicate tax haven abuses, tax evasion and the illegal flows of capital from developing countries. According to a Norwegian report published in June, the figures of which have been verified, the illegal flows leaving developing countries are ten times the amount of our development aid. This shows just how much is at stake. There is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay, on a country by country basis, in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. Moreover, a radical reform of the system must take place involving, in particular, the introduction of new democratic and transparent regulations for trade and the international financial systems. The responsibilities are huge, the challenges many, and the task arduous, but, now more than ever, the European Union must step up to the plate and lead these reforms. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I will use the brief time I have available to express my group’s support for the report by Mr Ferreira. In our opinion, it has at least two advantages. Firstly, it focuses on a vital fishing sector that is often overlooked and sacrificed: small-scale, artisanal and coastal fishing, which is the sector in which most European vessels and fishermen operate. Secondly, this report puts the problem of small-scale fishing at the heart of the reform of the common fisheries policy. If, as we hope, the new fisheries policy is based on sustainable fishing criteria, the interests of artisanal fishermen will be guaranteed and consolidated. We will only be able to ensure the future of thousands of small-scale fishermen, and with them the global food supply to which they make a vital contribution, if we have a fisheries policy that is firmly focused on conserving marine resources, and protecting and renewing stocks.

 Mr President, I have to say that I am fairly satisfied with Mrs Damanaki’s response on this issue of the consequences of rising oil prices for fishermen. This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity – and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay. We therefore cannot provide a short-term, circumstantial solution by increasing subsidies in line with the fluctuations in oil prices. This is a question of political logic. The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy. Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools. Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, on behalf of my three fellow Members, Mrs Pietikäinen, Mrs Sârbu and Mr Davies, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 410 Members of the European Parliament who signed Written Declaration 71/2010 on support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning, which we tabled. Indeed, this fragile species, like many others, is subjected to a veritable massacring at sea as a result of finning practices and the discarding of carcasses at sea following that mutilation. Thank you for having overwhelmingly signed this Written Declaration. It sends a strong signal to the Commission to bring about the strengthening of regulations to protect this species.

Mr President, I should like to focus my speech on Mr Luhan’s report. Regional cohesion policies have a key role to play in Europe for economic development that is balanced, socially harmonious and ecologically effective, that is, at the end of the day, globally competitive. I thank Mr Luhan for including some of our amendments aimed at establishing a sustainable low carbon economy which safeguards biodiversity. Nonetheless, we cannot vote for his resolution because it promotes a vision of cohesion policy as an instrument for global competitiveness that still appears to us to be too narrow, too restricted and inadequate. We must point out two sticking points. Firstly, the rapporteur relies almost exclusively on quantitative measures in terms of infrastructure as the driving force for growth, increase being his main criterion. We do not feel that is appropriate for the current situation. For example, he mentions 246 operational programmes in research and development and is proud of these, but without questioning what they are about. Research is a good thing but we also need to know what it is that we are researching. The second sticking point is that the rapporteur does not put forward sufficiently clear plans. We would have liked a robust choice in order to meet the challenges set out in his report, the choice of a green economy, of a green new deal which is the only choice capable of moving Europe and its regions upwards. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to an aspect of this resolution, which is of central and not secondary importance to me, and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning. The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds. It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this ‘targeted approach to territorial development’, to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach. What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies? Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth. However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product. People’s well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve. If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view. To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions – which, I would point out, is our shared objective – the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres. It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment.

 Mr President, the rather forbidding title of Mr Sterckx’s report introduces a very important issue, which goes far beyond the administrative and technical matters that the title implies. It deals with an important political decision, namely, making the maritime transport sector more attractive, more efficient and more competitive. In our view, this is the sector of the future and provides the best means of transport from an environmental point of view. Mr Sterckx’s excellent report and the contributions of all the shadow rapporteurs will allow us to make significant progress in this field. From our point of view, this directive hits the mark: it will increase the level of harmonisation within the maritime transport sector, making it better coordinated and simplified. We will therefore wholeheartedly support this report when we vote on the matter, even though we would have liked to see it implemented faster and to see more strength of resolve with regard to the introduction of a common language in that sector. However, we think that the compromises achieved with the Council are still acceptable. We therefore unreservedly support this report. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, I agree with the content and conclusions in the report by my colleague and friend Mr Romeva i Rueda, and I welcome the collective work that has been done on this report. The report is based on a reality that is now unavoidable. Bluefin tuna is under threat of extinction as a species, and many fishermen, an important economic sector and a vital food resource for mankind are at risk along with it. I would like to emphasise what this situation will really mean and the shock it will cause in relation to the period in which we currently live. For it is indeed a shock. For the first time, there is a clear threat to a major consumer product that is known to all, available on supermarket shelves and consumed by us all. It is a clear signal: the sign of a change of era. Protecting bluefin tuna is now a major early warning sign from the environment, and the significance of that warning goes far beyond the single issue of bluefin tuna. The threat to fish stocks and their much-needed protection are now the symbol of humanity’s entry into a new era of scarce resources: fish resources, food resources and energy resources. The key words should no longer be waste, overproduction and overconsumption, but saving, sharing and caution. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports Mr van Dalen’s report and recommendations. He offers us a balanced text which is the result of the close collaboration he managed to establish with the other political groups. We endorse this report because it clearly sets out the challenges facing the EU’s maritime policy, namely a significant increase in maritime traffic, both inside and outside the Union, without sacrificing the environment or social issues. This text is consistent with a rationale that we wish to see applied in all areas: a policy of sustainable development. It offers positive paths to allow maritime transport to develop between now and 2018 in the best possible conditions. In particular, we highlight the fight against abuses of flags of convenience or substandard vessels. We also highlight protection against piracy. We highlight having a policy designed within the framework of a single European sea, and the importance ascribed to the multimodal linking of European sea ports with the hinterland. We highlight the support for simplification of the administrative rules governing entry and exit from European ports. We highlight the promotion of maritime occupations and continuous training for them. Lastly, we highlight the priority given to environmental issues. On the whole, we will always support anything which, in our view, helps to promote a maritime transport sector which can compete with road and air transport. Mr van Dalen’s report has taken full stock of the global environmental challenge, for which maritime transport is one of the solutions. In particular, it is a useful tool against global warming. Our only regret is that the amendment that we tabled in order to integrate the maritime transport sector into the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system has not been taken up by the rapporteur or by the Commission. From our point of view, no economic sector should depart from the general rule, and, as with the air and road sectors, maritime transport, even if it is only responsible for low gas emissions, must do its part to reduce them. We will therefore be retabling our amendment to plenary. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, nobody has mentioned this yet, but something important happened on Sunday when the World Bank published its report and announced that the Earth will be more than four degrees warmer by 2060. Given that it is the World Bank saying this, I think it is safe to say that the situation is very serious. It means in practical terms that if we want to prevent this from occurring, we need to go from 35 billion cubic metres of CO2
 in 2050 to 10 billion. This requires very strict measures, not simply just to lower our emissions but to actually reduce them by a third or a half. This means that when we are dealing with this European and global issue today, we cannot simply chase after easily available energy sources if we want to avoid the effects of global warming. I say this because today everybody knows that methane has an effect on global warming 30 times greater than that of CO2
, and between 4 to 8 % of methane escapes between the wells and the pipes when extracting shale gas. This applies to all forms of methane, obviously. It is therefore a key issue. Finally, to give an example showing the need for European regulation, I went to visit a shale gas well near Wrocław in Poland operated by Halliburton. There was nothing to capture the water. Fracking had occurred and the water had just been released into the environment. That is why we need proper legislation and a moratorium while it goes through. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we are currently experiencing a situation where production is increasing by more than 2.5%. At the same time, industrialists are lowering their prices. In Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and throughout European countries, prices are falling. This clearly means that prices are linked to production volumes and that we must organise production volumes as well as prices. At the same time, today, producers are falling victim to an increase of more than 44% in the price of vegetable proteins and 30% in the price of cereals. Parliament has already voted on the need to ensure that added value is distributed among producers and that farmers do not become the victims of companies and large-scale distribution. I would therefore ask the Commission today, but also the Council, to once again call into question controls on production, but at the same time, and I say this very clearly, Member States must get their own house in order because there are countries which have respected the quota rules and others which have not. This is another reason why these quotas have been called into question. There is therefore a double responsibility on the part of the Commission and the Member States. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Deß, I understand what you are saying and I am entirely in agreement with you. I have a very specific question on this subject. In the documents that I have managed to collect, I see that in Germany, while there are normally price negotiations between milk producers and buyers, industrialists, cooperatives and so on, Aldi – which is today a large-scale distribution group – has unilaterally decided to lower the price of a litre of milk by six cents. At the same time, all the other ‘hard discounters’ have just done the same thing. How do you explain the fact that, in Germany, large-scale distributors can set prices while, normally, according to the mechanisms put in place by the European Union, there ought to be discussions between industrialists and producers? We can clearly see that today there is a problem in the rules for setting milk prices. How do you explain this? José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I should like to speak about the issue of granting discharge to agencies and specifically, the European Food Safety Authority. More than two years ago, I questioned Mr Dali about a possible conflict of interest concerning the President of that agency, Ms Bánáti. It turned out that I was correct: yesterday, Ms Bánáti was forced to resign on the eve of the forthcoming vote. Since she resigned, she has been recruited as director of the largest international agri-food lobby, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which brings together all the companies in the sector. We now have a genuine problem. Everyone is aware of that, including the director of that agency herself. We need to take a close look at the issue of conflicts of interest and the transparency of assessments. The same goes for medicines. Today, I am asking to postpone the vote on the discharge, not for financial reasons, but, very specifically, to ask the Commission to introduce clear rules in favour of transparency and against conflicts of interest.

Blue-card answer.

 I think that this is a positive move, but it is not enough. We need clear rules. We do not, however, have clear rules on conflicts of interest at the moment, not only for the appointment of management boards, but also for the appointment of experts. That is why I think that we have to take our time. If we refuse to grant this discharge, we shall have an historic opportunity to create transparency so that there can be no ambiguity about these agencies. I am in favour of the agencies and their development, and also of an increase in their state funding to avoid conflicts of interest with the private sector. I am campaigning today to strengthen the agencies, but that can only be done by combating conflicts of interest and ensuring transparency. José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, let me make a statement of fact: our citizens increasingly want to find and consume locally produced and seasonal food, for health and quality reasons in particular. We have to find ways to enable farmers to meet this growing demand effectively and quickly. We have to support the establishment of local infrastructure for producers, such as maintaining local abattoirs which, while guaranteeing rigorous sanitary control, facilitate the development of local short food supply chains and strengthen direct selling. Support for local agriculture and direct selling should help producers sell their products and bring them to the attention of consumers. Stronger direct relations will enable farmers to retain more of the added-value created on their farms. Direct selling within the farm must be promoted and facilitated and support must be given to the collective actions of farmers who want to open collective points of sale enabling them to offer local consumers a wider range of products. The Commission must facilitate the emergence, sustainability and development of systems of selling through direct delivery to consumers, such as the Associations for the Preservation of Smallholdings (AMAP) in France, which enable approximately 3 000 farmers to supply 60 000 families. Finally, Member States must be able to add other criteria concerning, in particular, the size of the farm, the volume of production or the traditional character of the product in order to define local agriculture. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. I simply want to say that the report on the free trade agreement bears my name, and as there has been a vote in favour of the agreement within the framework of the Committee on International Trade, the report continues to bear my name, and I urge you to vote against this report. Those who are against this agreement should vote no, not yes. I just wanted to clarify that. José Bové,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, in view of the outcome, I submit to the majority and withdraw my name, of course. In any case, I wish to thank all my colleagues in Parliament who have taken part in the debate, because it is very important to have held a debate on international trade for the first time. We need to continue along those lines. I hope the Commission will take into account the debates that have taken place. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, there are some saying today that this project has nothing to do with the common agricultural policy. I tell you this is not the case. What is now very clear is that the objective of the common agricultural policy was to ensure food security, to make sure that products are affordable for all consumers, ensuring farmers’ income. Feeding all the citizens of Europe is therefore part of the fundamental charter of the first integrated European policy. When we can now transfer money from the CAP balance to fund the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) to the tune of almost EUR 500 million, how is it that, in some States, some are questioning the EUR 500 million to help the poor? We have now reached an agreement until 2014. I think that after this, there will need to be a link between the CAP and welfare systems to ensure that the poorest have access to this food. We are committed to this and I hope that in terms of agricultural policy, special efforts will be made so that the poorest can also directly access production. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Nicholson on the courage he displayed when facing the Council and the Commission. Nevertheless, I fear that the end result does not strike a balance between producers and manufacturers. This agreement reminds me of the children’s tale about a paradise where vegetarian lions would lie down with lambs and eat grass. I do not believe it for a second! From 2003 Ms Fischer Boel did everything in her power to destroy the milk quotas from an ideological perspective. In October 2009, despite these efforts, the Court of Auditors recognised the effectiveness of the milk quotas. Today, however, we find ourselves in a situation that is going to be even worse and we can see what is already happening in Denmark, where the most solid farms, with rising production, are all going bankrupt, with a 40% reduction in land prices. Do we want to see the same thing right across Europe? Surely not! We need to control production with the participation of the public authorities. José Bové,  
rapporteur
. − (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU–Morocco agreement encourages both sides of the Mediterranean to concentrate on capital-intensive corporate farms at the expense of family and peasant farming. The rise in the number of quotas at reduced rates for a wide range of fruit and vegetables makes it difficult for EU producers to continue to compete, but at the same time does not help the development of balanced agriculture in Morocco. Labour costs are the principal factor determining the price of fruit and vegetables. Morocco has an undeniable advantage today due to the widespread use of child labour and the ban on agricultural workers forming trade unions. Workers in Morocco earn around EUR 5 per day, compared with EUR 50 in Spain. How can we cope with this type of competition and this social dumping? Respect for trade union rights and a ban on child labour are essential preconditions for ratification of a new trade agreement with Morocco. The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is a cause for concern among EU producer organisations. The problems with the system allow operators to reduce the import duties they pay. The European Commission has never equipped itself with the means to combat this type of fraud and it needs to resolve this issue before proposing a new agreement. In Morocco the way in which export quotas are managed favours large groups. In the tomato sector 70% of Moroccan exports come from just three groups. Moroccan family-run farms do not benefit from this agreement. According to a study funded by the European Union, the Abu Dhabi Tiris Euro Arab investment fund obtained 700 000 hectares in the south of Morocco to plant and harvest citrus fruits, olives and market-garden crops. The monopolising of land, which is so shocking to our fellow citizens, is also happening on a large scale in Morocco. In the Souss region, where tomato growing is concentrated, the water table is falling by two metres per year. In Western Sahara agri-businesses are drawing on coastal ground water. This irrigation results in the salinisation of fresh water, jeopardising the local population’s drinking water supply. Exporting 350 000 tonnes of tomatoes is equivalent to exporting 35 million cubic metres of water from Morocco to Europe. The social, environmental and economic effects have not been assessed by the Commission. We are still waiting for the impact study. A study is required to allow Parliament to reach a decision in full knowledge of the facts. We have never allowed an agreement to be adopted before identifying its social, economic and environmental repercussions. I have raised the question of the territorial scope of the EU–Morocco agreement. A number of countries, including the United States, have signed free trade agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco that expressly excluded Western Sahara. This was done so as not to influence the outcome of international negotiations being held under the aegis of the United Nations to enable the various parties to find a peaceful settlement. As the Commission and Parliament’s Legal Service hold diverging views on this issue, we cannot guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that this free trade agreement will comply with the international treaties that are binding on the European Union and all of its Member States. Consequently, the European Parliament should reject the agreement. That will enable us to reopen the negotiations on a new footing. I think that it will also send a strong message to the Commission to change its working method by allowing the European Parliament to participate from the initial stages of the discussions among the parties. The European Commission must produce concrete, serious impact studies on the economic, social, environmental and budgetary effects of the agreements it is negotiating. We can no longer accept the fact that Parliament only has the option of saying yes or no. I must inform you that, contrary to the opinion adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which opposes the agreement, the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade is to approve the agreement between the European Union and Morocco. I am bound to state that publicly. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the arguments that I have just set out, you will no doubt realise that I am asking you very clearly to vote against the conclusion of this agreement. This is not just in the interests of European farmers, who are unanimously opposed to the agreement right across the trade union spectrum, but also, and above all, it is in the interests of Moroccan farmers, who are today being deprived of their land by large exporter groups and who, because of this unbalanced agreement, are going to have their meat, dairy and cereal production capacity destroyed by imports by large European groups. I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject this agreement, which is a bad agreement. By rejecting it, we will reopen the debate but we will not prevent the previous agreement from continuing. It is thus simply the extension of the agreement that I am asking you to reject, in the interests of farmers on both sides of the Mediterranean. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, we have just had a debate that, in spite of everything, was interesting because for the first time it was a real debate on a free trade agreement. Some people referred to the facts, others to ideology, even belief, belief in free trade as a stepping stone to democracy. I hope that those people do not find themselves one day in a situation where they have to face the people who have suffered because of free trade agreements, of any kind: today the peasant farmers who produce fruit and vegetables, or tomorrow the meat producers when it is time for the Mercosur agreement. I believe that this free trade agreement is a bad agreement, especially for Morocco’s peasant farmers. If the ‘yes’ vote prevails on Thursday – which is of course possible as I do not know what will happen – it will mean that you are creating all of the conditions for the Arab Spring to arrive finally in Morocco. That means that you will be in a bit of a strange situation tomorrow. In fact, the agreement provides for an increase of more than 50% for European products on Moroccan territory, compared with just 15% for Moroccan products in Europe, which means that hundreds of thousands of Moroccan families are going to be thrown out on the street because of these exports to their country. Is that what you want? I get the impression today that you are not talking about the reality. You refuse to talk about the reality. We are accepting this agreement because Morocco is promising to protect us from the immigration from Africa. That is what is happening and it also features in all of your texts. Are we concluding economic agreements solely to build a wall on the other side of the Mediterranean to protect Europe? We have to get serious! We have to get back to the actual facts, and the actual facts all come down to agriculture. However, this agreement is a bad plan for agriculture. A 1% increase in volume over what is offered could lead to prices collapsing. As you are all too aware, Commissioner, the balance between supply and demand is very fragile. A 1% adjustment can make prices collapse and have devastating consequences. We know that Perpignan is currently a key transit point for tomatoes. We know that the head offices of the two largest firms, Azura and Idyl, are located in France. We know that today. So why are we continuing in this manner? We also know that the Commission has internal EU documents that show that more than 700 000 hectares were given to the Persian Gulf fund. You cannot deny that today; it is the Commission’s own documents that prove it. We need to get serious when it comes to the issue of water, too. We are told today that there is no information about water, even though European universities, in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, in addition to Moroccan universities are providing figures. I do not need to say any more. As regards our obligation to Western Sahara, I did not want to turn it into a political battle, but simply to raise a point of law. Indeed, the law is clear-cut. If Western Sahara is not excluded from this agreement tomorrow, you could face the possibility of action before the European Court of Justice. José Bové,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2010, Parliament adopted the report by the Committee on Agriculture aimed at ensuring fair revenues for farmers. In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other. The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work. On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation. The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources. European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products. We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production. In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions. Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances. However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc. The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves. Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP. The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm. Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource. This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing. Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers! José Bové,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important. The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain. Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial. Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense. José Bové,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, now that this text has been adopted, I think that it is important to point out that a collective effort was made on the part of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and that, thanks to this collective effort, we shall be able to step up the pressure on the Commission and the Council to ensure that, finally, farmers in Europe are taken into consideration, both in terms of their costs and their income. I should therefore like to thank this Assembly for that and to thank my fellow Members who helped me draw up this report, in particular, Mr Lorensen. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not want to repeat what everyone has already said, but I believe that, today, Europe does in fact have a real problem of credibility as a result of what is happening. We are being put on trial. We are being told, on the one hand, that there is the European policy and, on the other, that there is the policy of the Member States. However, if the Treaty of Rome of 1958 tells us that we must ensure that all Europeans are fed and that we must guarantee food security, this is a European policy. It is not a policy of the Member States Today, this situation shows, in addition to the selfishness of a number of Member States, that what is lacking is not more Europe but rather a European will on the part of a number of Heads of State or Government. At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the European Commissioner, Mr Cioloş, who, in an opinion piece published in the Le Monde
 newspaper, had the courage to say that this policy was essential for the poorest Europeans. If we are incapable of challenging the decision of the Council, Europe will be disowned by its citizens. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I wanted to speak as we met in your country, in Warsaw, with the delegation from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, when we decided to speak on a number of very specific issues. It was pointed out, with regard to climate, that the Polish Presidency was somewhat cautious and did not want to make this issue a priority, as the Durban climate change conference is taking place at the end of the year. The European Parliament has very clearly stated the need to reduce CO2
 emissions by 25% or even by 30%. Yet, when it comes to environmental safety, I unfortunately do not sense the same will from you as you asserted this morning – which I was pleased to hear – regarding energy security and food security. Environmental security seems to be just as fundamental to me and we will not have one without the other. I think this is a central point. On food security, I would like your Presidency to be more active. Yesterday, the European Parliament said very clearly that countries should have the right to opt out of cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately, while we were voting on that, you changed the law in Poland on 1 July to allow GMOs in, under pressure from Mr Barroso. I would like you to enable this procedure in order to ensure that countries have the right to resist, as you have done for many years. Another point, now, at the end of the year … (The President interrupted the speaker)
 … the meeting of energy ministers is going to take place; I would like you to take into account the requirement to have a policy for a moratorium on shale gas. (Applause) José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lepage, I think that the rapporteur has tried to do the best she could do in a bad situation. The European Commissioner has presented a proposal for renationalisation, which has been a total failure from a legal point of view, because, as we have seen, the legal services of Parliament and of the Council said that this solution was contrary to competition law and would pose major problems at an international level. So proposing to Member States now that this debate can be taken up again without a clear legal basis will create more problems than it will solve. I will be brief. Commissioner, what I want to hear from you today is a very clear statement on whether you will commit yourself to integrating into European legislation the rules that will be adopted by Parliament in the context of the revision of the directive on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do agree that, as well as liberty and fraternity, there should be equality for farmers and the new Member States in Eastern Europe. Yes, I agree with you. I think that this report marks a huge step forward. It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational. However, the important thing is that we reached a consensus. This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision, and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament’s great strength. We have succeeded, despite the difficulties, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and all the Members. The first phase is complete. In this document, we have reiterated the need for equality, justice and fairness for producers and regions. I think that is important. We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms, that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity. In my opinion, this was another fundamental point. The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts. We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations. This is not a question of ideology. Lastly, at present, we are worried about the real budgetary threats. We need to come up with unequivocal responses. What we want now is to move into the second phase, which is obviously the legislative debate. Why? Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going. That is essentially what we are waiting for. Let me close, however, by expressing my fury at Germany’s attitude. It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe’s poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount. That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget. I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat. José Bové,

 Madam President, Commissioner, as in 2008, the price of agricultural raw materials is soaring on world markets. We are only at 3% of the 2008 level. The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission. The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day. Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line. Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States? Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets. This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators. The impact is also dramatic for European farmers. They are no longer able to feed their animals. Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300. This is a whole new ball game. The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well, today, to follow its own advice. Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions. The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions. Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price. Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices. Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, a year ago, you told me that GMOs had polluted your first term of office and that you wanted to refer the issue back to the Member States. A few days ago, 1 200 000 signatures were collected from European citizens asking for an independent expert report on GMOs. A few days ago again, the Environment Council rejected Commissioner Dalli’s proposal by a very large majority. The opinions of both Council’s and Parliament’s legal advisers have also been negative. Lastly, you have witnessed the scandal at EFSA with the Banati affair and the questions raised by the panel. What is more, EFSA itself has decided to issue new assessment guidelines. What I would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations, such as that of MON810, until the new EFSA rules have come into force? New assessments and authorisation renewals should be processed according to the new rules. Finally, are you willing to relaunch the debate so that we can get an independent assessment? José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Thank you for your answer. However, EFSA has already put in place new guidelines that are much stricter. Are you willing to agree that all new authorisations that have been granted over this latest period and the issue of MON810 should be reviewed in the light of these new guidelines? We cannot accept assessments today that were carried out on the basis of old rules. That is why I am asking you this question very precisely and I would like you to start this whole debate again from scratch, instead of waiting until 2012. Directive 2001/18/EC is due to be updated in 2012: the process needs to be brought forward. José Bové,

Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago. Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month. Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe’s small-scale agriculture before we act? Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo – is that right? On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers. It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price. The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers’ organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors. Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility. Next week, Commissioner Cioloş will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers. Europe’s credibility is at stake. Europe needs every single one of its farmers. José Bové,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for their support in this task. This report, like the one by Mr Lyon, is part of our major debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We have managed to reach a large number of compromises, which have been adopted by a large majority in our group – by 32 votes to 4. I believe that our message to the Commission is a powerful one: we all want greater transparency in the food chain and legislation that guarantees fair competition between farmers and all operators in the food chain. We also want concrete measures, in Europe and elsewhere, to combat speculation and abuses of market power and to safeguard farmers’ revenues. I am surprised that, on the initiative of one or two political groups in this House, we are being asked to vote tomorrow on a long list of separate votes, which go against the powerful and consensual message that we adopted by a large majority in committee. Could it be that events over the summer have made you change your minds? I rather think that the intense lobbying carried out in recent days by the large-scale distribution sector and certain operators in the agri-food industry is the reason for the excessive number of separate votes. In any case, I cannot imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that you would give in to such pressure in order to weaken our common message. Our committee has taken stock of the crisis affecting European farmers. It intends to propose concrete, strong measures: in less than 10 years, the Union has lost 3.5 million farming jobs. It is a massacre on a terrible scale. Bulgaria, for example, has lost one in two farmers. In 2009, revenues plummeted. In France and Germany, farmers have lost 20% of their revenue on average, and in Hungary, they have lost more than 35%. Farming and rural communities are in danger of disappearing. Forced as it was by the exasperation of farmers and by the demonstrations of dairy cattle breeders, in December 2009, the European Commission published a communication entitled, ‘A better functioning food supply chain in Europe’. The latter shows that, between 1995 and 2005, the proportion of the added value of the food chain that went to agricultural producers decreased from 31% to 24%. The prices paid to farmers are falling in virtually every sector, without European consumers benefiting as a result. The Commission says that these problems are linked to increased concentration in the wholesale, processing and distribution sectors, which impose their will on unorganised producers. The Commission is concerned about the lack of transparency in relation to pricing and margins. It recognises the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data, and admits that it does not have the information it needs to adapt its policies quickly and effectively. To remedy this, I propose that the Commission creates a European farm prices and margins observatory, on the model of that which exists in the United States. This body will be responsible for defining European farmers’ production costs. It will tell us the real costs of a litre of milk, a kilo of wheat or a kilo of beef from the moment it leaves the farm. This information will serve as a basis for negotiations between farmers and the other operators in the food chain. This body will also be responsible for assessing which sectors claim all the added value, to the detriment of producers and consumers. The European Commission would thus be able to identify which operators are abusing the balance of power and abusing their dominant position. It also seems crucial to make the 20 largest European companies draft an annual report on their market share and the internal margins they generate. Transparency poses no threat to the market economy. On the contrary, it is an absolute necessity in order to prevent the abuses that have been observed in agriculture and in many other sectors, in particular, that of finance. Who can claim that, when farmers sell their milk or their meat, they are on an equal footing with multinationals, which influence commodity price building on the global markets? The balance of power is completely unbalanced, and some would say unfair. In order to restore the balance, a first emergency measure would be to allow farmers to come together within producers’ organisations. The second, additional measure involves prohibiting selling of goods below purchase price at Community level. Forced discounts, subsequent alterations to contract terms, and unjustified listing fees are a common occurrence. They are hitting farmers and the thousands of small and medium-sized processing companies hard, because they have to go through the large-scale distribution sector in order to sell their products. The European Commission must take stock of the extent of these anti-economic practices, and it must take the measures required to stop them. Lastly, speculation on agricultural commodities is a scourge. Financiers and speculators are looking for instant rewards and instant profits. For them, poverty, hunger and famine are synonymous with profits. We did not think that we would relive the 2008 riots, but we could not have been more mistaken. Since June, the price of wheat has risen by more than 70%. The prices of maize, soya and rice are also on the increase. Last week, seven people were killed in Maputo, Mozambique, for demonstrating against the 30% increase in food prices. Are we going to continue to stand by and do nothing, as we did two years ago? Are we going to continue to put up with investment banks bankrupting European farmers and crushing the men and women of our planet? I call on the European Union to take the initiative to create a global agency to regulate the markets. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to send out a strong message so that the new CAP is fairer for European farmers and consumers and so that there is fair competition between operators which allows for the creation of a framework for regulating the markets and which gives short shrift to speculators. It is the responsibility of the European Parliament, as it prepares to exercise its joint decision-making power in agricultural matters, not to submit to any pressure, from wherever it may come. Our message must remain clear and consistent. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I am pleased with the debate that we have just had, in which a very large number of Members were able to speak. It is true that, at this time, on the first day of the part-session, there are rather too many of us for this debate, which shows just how interested all of the groups are in the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The important thing for me is that the report that we have debated, the text that is going to be voted on tomorrow in this House, is a joint text. This has been mentioned by a number of speakers. I am the rapporteur, but this text has been drafted jointly within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I think that that is very important. Everyone came with his or her own idea or story, and we came up with this proposal together. I feel it is important to emphasise this. It is my name that appears on this report, but it is a joint report, and I wanted to reiterate that. Several speakers stressed the need to safeguard farmers’ incomes through the sale of their agricultural products. That is the very foundation of agriculture. Farmers are paid from the sale of their products, and so to say that, today, farmers cannot sell below production cost is an essential, indispensable condition if we are to continue to have farmers in Europe in the future. Agricultural policy makes it possible to support, to maintain agricultural activity across regions, and to combat distortions linked to natural handicaps or to the regions. Therefore, the fact is that there will be no common agricultural policy if farmers cannot earn a living from their production in the first place. Farmers are the ones making the strongest calls in this regard, and Parliament has just successfully repeated their demands. The second point that I feel emerged clearly from our debate just now is the need for transparency all along the food chain. All the speakers came back to this point at various levels, in particular, with regard to the processing sector in negotiations with producers, or with the large-scale distribution sector, which, often, for example in the case of fruit and vegetables, creams off unbelievable profits. Today, all that is acknowledged; this need is no longer in doubt. Many speakers also focused on the issue of speculation; I am not going to go back over it. Therefore, I would say that, once the vote has been held tomorrow in plenary – and I believe that all the speeches have demonstrated the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s collective will to table this report and to convince all of our fellow Members – once the text is adopted, once it is voted for tomorrow, the ball will be in the Commission’s court. Moreover, I should like to say to the Commissioner: it is now up to you to take action. This is an initiative that we are taking. We are making proposals to you. Our expectation, of course, is that this work will now be taken up by the Commission and the Council, since it is clear that Parliament alone will be unable to do anything. On the other hand, by working together, we will be able to build a new common agricultural policy. Above all, however, we will be able to give hope to European farmers. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, first of all I would obviously like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lyon, with whom I believe we all worked on the basis of mutual agreement to try to move forward, and I would like to say briefly, in just a few words, that the evidence is there for us to see. The evidence is that, today, Europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials. We must have an ambitious agricultural and food policy so that we can ensure that our citizens’ food needs are met. Furthermore, today we have a CAP that must be reformed for three reasons. It is a CAP that is unfair, economically, socially and environmentally. Economically: the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must allow for this problem to be resolved. Socially: aid is unfairly distributed between countries, regions and farmers. Eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20% of farmers. Environmentally: we need a CAP which respects the soil, which respects … (The President cut off the speaker) José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, reopening negotiations with Mercosur when the European Union is getting ready to redefine its agricultural policy reveals a dangerous lack of consistency on the part of the Commission. Europe already imports 500 000 tonnes of beef. Opening up our market even further would be to the disadvantage of the cattle breeders of Europe’s less-favoured areas, without any guarantee of respect for health and social standards. We cannot accept this. Europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle. These imports from Brazil and Argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares. They are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises: Cargill, ADM and Bunch. Between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1.2 million hectares of tropical and equatorial forest. It is one of the principal causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity. The European Parliament has decided to produce a report on the recovery of autonomy in respect of vegetable proteins for livestock feed. This decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change. These efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement. Once again the European Commission is selling short its farming and its farmers in order to obtain chance gains for service companies. These concessions will not serve the interests of the farming families of Mercosur, only those of agro-industrial groups. Convincing evidence of this can be found in the report by the Tyson group, a US corporation and heavyweight in the international meat market, which announced that it has invested in Brazil – I quote, and it is in its report – to use this country as a platform for exporting to Europe. Other enterprises, such as the Doux Group, had already anticipated this move by buying out the Brazilian Frangosul Group in 1998. Many poultry farmers, particularly in Brittany, paid the price for that deal. Europe seems to want to pursue its policy of relocation by intensifying its attacks against farmers. We must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality, locally produced food. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against hunger demands a substantial political and financial investment. The Food and Agricultural Organisation was unable to generate that investment last week in Rome, and I regret that. More than a billion people suffer from malnutrition and 40 million men, women and children die of hunger each year. These dramatic figures have risen since 1996, the year of the first World Food Summit. The global financial and economic crisis has aggravated the situation, and the populations of the countries of the South are the main victims. Ten per cent of the advertising budget worldwide would allow developing countries to be given the necessary support to safeguard their agricultural infrastructure. The food crisis is one of the main threats hanging over peace and stability in the world. In 2050, small farmers will have to feed more than 9 billion people. Soil damage, damage to biodiversity, oil dependency, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and the development of consumption patterns put us in a very fragile situation, more fragile than 40 years ago. Poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity. The need to support local production is obvious. At the end of the 1950s, Europe introduced the common agricultural policy in order to produce the food it needed. To do this it protected its internal market and supported its consumers. This autonomous choice, this right to food sovereignty, must now be accessible to all the countries or groups of countries throughout the world that want it. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, please excuse me, I was supposed to come earlier, but I was tied up. I was explaining to French listeners what took place yesterday in Luxembourg. I believe that the Council’s decision is a bad one, since the only word to appear in the text is ‘restructuring’. In France, we have gone from having 480 000 milk producers in 1984 to having fewer than 88 000 today. Today, we are told that yet more producers must be forced out and that the money that will be recouped – this appears in the text – will be used for producers who have exceeded their quota. Production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out. This is the wrong approach. The money that has been given, the EUR 280 million – the figure has already been quoted – equates to EUR 50 per month and per farm, for one year. That is peanuts; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through. Lastly, on the subject of Article 186, I should like to say that, at a time when we are moving towards codecision in agricultural matters, it is unacceptable for power, for a blank cheque, to be handed back to the Commission. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for months now livestock farmers have been warning the Commission and the Council of the gravity of the crisis. Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas. The European Union had counted on growth in world demand. Its experts got it very wrong. The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption. The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council’s wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers. Times have changed. European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment. The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs. On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents. At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money. Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives. In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly. We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers. The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry. It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs. The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme. It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets. It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate. Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand. A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable. It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns. Without the small farmers, there will be no Europe. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, we are all saying the same thing: the employment situation in Europe is catastrophic. With one quarter of young people under 25 unemployed, there is a lot at stake for the new generation, which refuses to be a lost generation. The Commission has opened up the way with its employment package, which is designed to create 17 million jobs by 2020. However, it continues to lead us towards disaster by driving through austerity plans which increase unemployment and condemn the most vulnerable to the worst kind of hardships. Yet, an exit from the crisis is simple. We must transform our economy ecologically and socially. To that end, we need to develop green, sustainable and non-outsourceable jobs through targeted investments in green, innovative industries. We need to invest in life-long training and in promoting the social and solidarity economy. In addition, it is necessary to promote decent work, taking into account the objectives of the International Labour Organisation of improving rights and working conditions, and to reaffirm the vital need to increase the minimum wage so as to put an end to the scandal of poor workers and to fight social dumping. We have the means to end the scourge of unemployment. Yes, it is possible! What, then, is lacking? All that is lacking is the political will. That is your responsibility! Mr Barroso accorded high priority to the issue of youth and youth unemployment in particular. What is the youth unemployment situation now, three years later? There are no specific proposals. There is nothing. Action needs to be taken and it needs to be taken now. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, in its proposal for a regulation covering all the Structural Funds, the Commission has earmarked a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a future food aid scheme for the most needy for 2014-2020, despite fierce opposition from a minority of Member States within the Council. This is a brave decision by the Commission and one which is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, but, more importantly, with those of most of our fellow citizens. This is at a time when, with the worsening of the social crisis, increasing numbers throughout Europe are calling upon help from food banks. It is a brave decision, but it is not enough. At present, the food aid programme for the most deprived is worth EUR 500 million per year. By proposing a budget of EUR 2.5 billion over seven years, the Commission has consciously reduced this budget by EUR 1 billion, even though the demand is continuously increasing. In addition, we know nothing of the Commission’s intentions in terms of how the future programme will be introduced. If the funds are allocated within the framework of the European Social Fund, it will be difficult to continue buying food on the agricultural markets to distribute it to the most deprived because of the way in which the social fund is managed, especially since this practice has been condemned by the European Court of Justice. However, if no solution is found, the food banks will find themselves in a situation that they have managed to avoid until now. What do you actually intend to do? I, for one, believe it is necessary to maintain a decent budget for this programme and to ensure that each and every one of us, especially the most deprived, has the right to healthy food at an affordable price. Lastly, I believe an effective safety net is needed, as is a strong framework directive on a minimum income. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Commissioner, more than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. It is therefore with a certain amount of relief that we welcome the new extension of the European food aid programme until 2014. The poorest will continue to receive the essential charitable support that they need at a time when the demands faced by these charities are growing. Yet the real question is what next. What will happen after 2014? Is it not just lip service the promise to reduce poverty by a quarter in the EU by 2020? We must give ourselves the means to achieve this goal. That is why we will ensure that the new financial framework preserves this programme as part of the cohesion policy to ensure that those Member States in need do actually benefit from this aid. However, there is one condition: this transfer to the ESF should also be allocated a large enough budget to ensure that no-one is left by the wayside. What is at stake here is the matter of solidarity between the European people. One final point, Commissioner, the poorest are also entitled to a healthy and balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. Karima Delli,

Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, I am angry. Here we are two years after the consensus conference rightly piloted a European strategy for the homeless under the Belgian Presidency. The European Parliament drafted a written declaration in favour of the homeless. No response. I drafted the resolution in favour of a European strategy for the homeless. The Commission did not respond to our request, which remains a dead letter. I am sorry that today there is no one on the Council’s bench, while it is the Member States’ responsibility to ensure the right to housing assistance for all those who do not have sufficient resources. In two weeks, the spell of very cold weather has killed over 600 people; this has already been said. I say it time and again: the homeless do not only die in winter. All year round they sleep on the streets and all year round they have their rights trampled on. European citizens expect more from the European Union today. It must be united and active faced with the distress of the most vulnerable people. The situation is more than worrying. I will give you a few examples. In Greece, the number of homeless people has increased by 25% in two years. In Hungary, the homeless are persecuted by the police and threatened with heavy fines. In France, we are seeing decrees which criminalise begging and stealing food from bins. Where is this headed? We are seeing it more and more: austerity policies led by the governments will have disastrous consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, let us demand a shake-up, a wake-up call. We can change things. I will say it very clearly, Commissioner; the European Union must play its part for solidarity between the Member States and the European people. We must urgently bring together the ministers concerned. The time for saving the banks is over. It is now time to save lives. We have already waited too long. Each Member State must make the Commission aware of the measures it has put in place since the cold spell began. We must mobilise an emergency fund immediately to come to the aid of the most vulnerable people. The Member States which do not respect their obligation to provide emergency assistance to the most impoverished must be sanctioned, particularly those which criminalise the homeless or prohibit access to emergency shelters for certain groups of people. Finally, Mr Barnier, the Commission must put in place a European strategy for the homeless immediately. The aim is clear; we have discussed it here; ladies and gentlemen, no one should be sleeping on the streets by 2015. This is an emergency. In order to dream, you must have somewhere to sleep. If we let it, this glacial silence from European representatives will lead to distrust among the citizens. You really need to react … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) needs this debate. This instrument has a positive role but, first of all, the procedures are too long to provide effective protection for workers who need support quickly so that they are not left to their own devices. Secondly, the brief history of this EGF has already been plagued by very controversial cases of payments from public authorities which served only to repair the damage caused by companies savagely outsourcing. The European Union would do better than to beat its head against a brick wall. It needs, first of all, to think about how it authorises free trade which is both lawless and unscrupulous. When will social and environmental criteria be integrated in our commercial agreements to combat dumping? The famous EGF must be a tool supporting the immediate transition to high quality ‘green’ jobs, hence local jobs that cannot be outsourced. In the specific case of Renault, the EGF does not authorise the cofinancing of passive measures. What is the current situation in the case of Renault? Neither the Renault Group, nor the French Government, nor the European Commission has been able to convince us that the training measures offered to workers at the time were active measures. What does that mean? It means real training programmes aimed at making people employable. That is the first thing. Secondly, I think that the case, in particular, of all the workers threatened with insecurity because they joined the early retirement scheme is not a specifically French issue – as has been said – but a question of European solidarity. All workers must be treated in the same way: some have nothing to gain from measures, while others do. I am pleased to hear my colleague, Mr Gauzès, for whom I have very high regard, tell us today, in this Chamber, that Renault has committed itself to take concrete measures. I am a little sad to hear this only today. I think he should have woken up long ago. Karima Delli,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis should in no way be used as a pretext for neglecting health and safety at work. Our aim is to provide good-quality employment to all workers, despite persistent mass unemployment and a sharp rise in casual work. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at work, 168 000 people die each year in Europe as a result of work-related accidents and illnesses, of which more than half are cancers, and one quarter are cardio-vascular diseases. How can we not be shocked by this growing number? As rapporteur for the review of the European strategy on health and safety at work, which will come to an end in 2012, my conclusions are clear. It would be morally wrong to turn a blind eye to people’s suffering at work. It would also be a mistake in economic terms, because all the studies indicate that accidents and professional illnesses are very costly, both to our health and social security systems and to our businesses. From 2013 onwards, this strategy should be more ambitious, more consistent and, above all, more courageous. To achieve that, we need to strengthen the legislative framework and adapt current legislation to new occupational hazards such as psychosocial risks, musculoskeletal problems and nanomaterials. Work-related stress should not be treated merely with training courses, as this has proven entirely insufficient given that half of all European workers are exposed to risks that affect their mental health. The truth should be spelled out. Workers suffer, in particular, from the sudden reorganisation or intensification of their work and poor methods of management. Furthermore, many employees draw attention to dangers for people as well as the environment. These workers must be protected. I am proud that Parliament is calling on the Commission to establish a directive that protects these much talked about whistle-blowers. The European Commission should not hesitate to bring infringement proceedings against Member States that do not respect their obligations. European harmonisation in the health sphere is a significant step forward. It is also vital to foster a culture of prevention in Europe. The Member States should increase the staff employed in their labour inspection services and seek to achieve the objective of one inspector per 10 000 workers, in accordance with International Labour Organisation recommendations. There is absolutely no justification for weakening the prevention rules in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or for independent workers, who enjoy the same fundamental right to health protection. Furthermore, we have observed an increase in outsourcing of work and the emergence of subcontracting chains. There are new groups of workers who are not covered by prevention policies: casual workers, bogus self-employed people, subcontracted workers, and so on. Given the risk of exposure to powerful radiation and the dangers linked to the management of radioactive waste, it is essential that rigorous standards are applied to training, safety at work and inspection by independent bodies. Finally, we need to take stock of new, emerging hazards, such as chemical and biological risks, which are complex but for which there is still insufficient data. Rapid action needs to be taken on asbestos, silica and other recognised carcinogens. The REACH provisions play a very important part in preventing cancers and other work-related diseases. It needs to be kept up-to-date and comprehensively implemented. Finally, professional illnesses should be recognised, or better recognised, starting with cancers, in order to quickly identify all of the issues. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on all of you to support my report, because I am perfectly sure that it will enable us to meet all these challenges, and that Europe has a role to play. It should protect all workers, who must not lose their lives on account of their job. Commissioner, I hope that, from 2013, there will be a European strategy on health and safety at work, and I truly hope that we will make swift progress on this. Karima Delli,

Madam President, Mr Daerden, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank Mr Daerden for the true spirit of cooperation that has marked the work of the committee. First, a small preliminary point. I would like to remind this House that if we want to combat poverty, there is no use trying the employability approach. In other words, nowadays, work is no longer a true protection against poverty. There are millions of poor people in work. I would like to highlight three particular points which I think are vital if we want to make progress with realistic objectives in the fight against poverty within the EU 2020 strategy. Firstly, the call for a legislative proposal on schemes for a minimum income equal to 60% of the average income in each Member State, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our Parliament one year ago. I think that, as the crisis has worsened, we have become aware that such a measure is essential for our poorest citizens. Secondly, the call for a framework directive targeted at guaranteeing the quality of, and especially accessibility to, all social services of general interest, particularly in health, education, public transport, energy and water. Thirdly, we are re-drafting a call to Member States to adopt at the earliest opportunity the proposal for a wide-ranging, anti-discrimination proposal. I welcome these latter two points which seem to me of utmost importance. We are calling for the implementation of a genuine European strategy to help the homeless. The Commission and the Member States can no longer turn a deaf ear to the issue of poor housing in Europe. A genuine solution must be found to these problems today. I am also delighted that we have reached a final agreement on negotiations over food aid, but we should not forget that we must now start thinking about the period after 2013, or more generally about earmarking substantial sums from the cohesion policy budget for the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Finally, I would like to encourage the participation, thanks to this report, of all civil society in the introduction of the platform, because we can only speak for the poor if we do so with them.

 The adoption of this report calling on the Commission to work towards introducing binding legislation on an adequate minimum income at the poverty threshold level, which is an indispensable tool for achieving the realistic objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020, is a major victory. To fight poverty, it is not enough to make speeches on growth: with 8.4% of workers poor in the EU, employment no longer protects against poverty. I am pleased that the proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to tax high incomes has been approved. It is high time that the Heads of State or Government understood that they are not there to serve the interests of the richest 1%, but to defend the 99%. I am pleased that people living in poverty will play a crucial role in the establishment of this platform. Today, policy must be drawn up ‘with’ and not just ‘for’ the poorest. I regret that our call for a framework directive on the quality and accessibility of social services of general interest was rejected. Universal access to public services is fundamental to the protection of the poorest. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently 80 million people living with a disability in Europe. Almost 70% of them are unemployed and 25% live in poverty. The European Union has a few aces up its sleeve to help these people and ensure greater equality of rights: raising more European funding, conducting widespread awareness campaigns, and compiling pan-European statistics in order to make public policies more effective. Above all, however, it is time to release the draft anti-discrimination directive, which has been blocked for over 10 years by Europe’s Heads of State or Government. I am pleased that my fellow MEPs have rallied behind us to ensure that the following message is heard loud and clear: the next stage in the fight for equal rights is an agreement between the EU Member States on this directive. Backed into a corner, the governments can no longer evade their responsibilities. We also call on the Commission to propose a major EU directive on accessibility for people with disabilities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the wave of redundancies that is affecting workers across Europe must lead us to reflect on the role that we, as political representatives, must play in the face of multinational firms that are acting without any social ethics, proceeding with shareholder-driven redundancies and relocating their operations in order to cut costs, increase their shareholders’ profits and please the rating agencies, with no regard whatsoever for social and environmental standards. In its resolution of 29 September on the future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), Parliament clearly expressed its desire to support, first and foremost, the workers adversely affected by restructuring. We called on the Commission to ensure consistency between EGF interventions and the European Union’s industrial policy, notably through the use of the structural funds. We also called for improvements in the future EGF Regulation to ensure that the fund does not generate moral hazard effects for multinational companies, as demonstrated today by the ArcelorMittal and Nokia cases. Commissioner, we can no longer continue to look separately at the structural funds and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund without taking into account the restructuring strategies of companies that benefit from them and without examining the cost-benefit ratio of a policy – and I shall say it again clearly – that benefits European workers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise. More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme. The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival. The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid. I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested. Parliament spoke some strong words last time, when we said that human beings are more important than finance. It is high time we reasserted that. In any case, Parliament will be extremely vigilant, and we will not hesitate to renew our call in a constructive manner. Karima Delli,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, a debate is being held in this House on the situation of homeless people! I should like to begin by paying tribute to all the associations in the community that work all year round to help the most vulnerable people among us, the homeless. Not having a home to call one’s own is a serious violation of fundamental rights and human dignity. It is the most visible and the saddest link in the chain of poor housing. Above all, it is an unacceptable form of injustice. It is crucial to understand why people end up on the streets, so that proper preventive policies can be put in place. Rather than looking for ways of getting these people off the streets, it is much easier not to plunge them into homelessness in the first place. When are we going to put a stop to tenant eviction? When are we going to stop property speculation? When will we finally realise that rising poverty and insecurity lead to exclusion? The face of homelessness has changed; the image of the bohemian down-and-out belongs in the past. The reality today is much more complex and much harsher. It is increasingly young people, women, families – in particular migrants – and even poor workers who are without a home. There are many types of homelessness. Of course, there are the homeless people that one sees on the floor in the street, in winter, under cardboard boxes, or in tents in public parks, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Millions of people live in emergency hostels, in temporary housing or with friends or family; they may even sleep in cars or in insalubrious hotels. Faced with an emergency situation that is becoming worse by the day, the associations are constantly sounding the alarm. However, governments come and go, and the scandalous failure to address the situation continues. It is high time the Member States faced up to their responsibilities. It is high time we put a stop to this shameful situation. Europe must strive to help the Member States establish fundamental values and long-term solutions to this situation, because our main duty is to protect the weakest among us. In the light of this unacceptable situation, we cannot continue to look the other way, in the same way as people avoid looking at homeless people on the street. What is worse, homeless people are expelled from town centres to the outskirts, far from the stares of businessmen and tourists. However, just because they are out of sight, it does not mean they do not exist! There is no point in hiding the problem; it needs to be resolved today. In one country, which you know well, Commissioner, homeless people are quite simply regarded as criminals. They are forbidden from sleeping on the streets, and are fined if they do, and the police hunt them down as far as underground stations or railway stations, despite the fact that there are no appropriate services in place to accommodate them. The time for communication, false political promises and campaign slogans, as we see in certain States, is now past. That is why, following the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, Parliament is calling on you to implement an integrated strategy aimed at resolving the problem of homelessness by 2020, based on the work that has already been carried out. This strategy should focus on five major objectives: firstly, preventing homelessness; secondly, reducing its duration; thirdly, targeting the most severe types of homelessness; fourthly, improving the quality of services for homeless people; and finally, providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing. This strategy must be coordinated with national and regional strategies. The results achieved with regard to the indicators developed jointly at European level must be regularly reviewed. Emphasis must be placed on social innovation, in particular, measures aimed at making housing the first step on the path towards social reintegration. Lastly, adequate funding must be guaranteed at both European and national level. Commissioner, all talk aside, this is an emergency. Action is needed now. This is a question of political will: people do not have to be made homeless. Let us not wait until winter to remember that people die on the streets all year round. It is possible to put a stop to homelessness, and I think that the European Parliament is showing the way. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1986, a great French actor, the founder of the Restos du coeur
 soup kitchens, said: ‘It is high time that we showed some solidarity.’ Twenty-five years on, what have we achieved? Poverty and inequalities are on the rise. It is high time that you faced up to your responsibilities. In particular, you need to prod into action all those Member States that are failing to help our poorest citizens. It is also high time that we eradicated poverty. How long are we going to wait before adopting a real framework directive on minimum pay that will allow everyone to live in dignity, but above all, will give them enough to eat and guarantee all of their fundamental rights? At a time when we are discussing a European platform against poverty and when we are being told that 43 million Europeans are at risk, you decide to cut the budget. That is a scandalous decision. Let me repeat that: it is scandalous. It is high time that … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty is the most cruel, most inhumane and most degrading penalty, and is a violation of the right to life, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Davinder Pal Singh is in danger of being executed imminently in New Delhi, in India, as the President of India rejected his plea for clemency in May, and it should be noted that this is the second appeal rejected in the course of that month. That is why this resolution sends a strong signal from the European Parliament. The European Parliament must condemn all executions, no matter where they take place. The European Parliament must encourage the European Union and its Member States to ensure that the United Nations resolution calling for a universal moratorium on executions is applied. The aim of this resolution is to achieve complete abolition in all those states that still apply capital punishment. I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed to this resolution. I shall simply mention in closing that I have tabled two amendments, because I would like to remind you that Davinder Pal Singh had already applied for political asylum in Germany, but he was forcibly deported to India, where he was arrested on his arrival in New Delhi in January 1995. Nevertheless, two years later, the Court in Frankfurt declared his expulsion to be illegal. He should therefore never have been deported to India, where his life was under threat. Finally, there is a wide range of evidence to suggest that Davinder Pal Singh did not receive a fair trial. That is the subject of the second amendment to be voted on. I would like to thank my fellow Members, and I hope that the entire resolution and the two amendments will be adopted. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the vote on the report by Mr De Rossa, which reminds us that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are at the heart of the European social model. We would point out that SSGIs are available to everyone and that we should ensure that everyone has access to them, especially with regard to social housing. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to propose legislation recognising universal access to basic banking services and to broadband Internet. Finally, we are asking for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between economic and non-economic services, which would provide greater protection for social services. Unfortunately, while the urgency of the economic and social situation would have required Members to demand a framework legislative tool on SSGIs, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed in its alternative resolution, my fellow Members refused to take that courageous initiative. The horizontal social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantee social rights, especially the right to access services of general interest. The time has come to prove to EU citizens that a social Europe is on its way and to give public services the place they deserve in European law. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, the cross-cutting social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon place a binding obligation on States to protect social rights and the right of access to services of general interest in particular. It is time we proved to Europe’s citizens that social Europe works. We must therefore give our body of social legislation its rightful place in EU law, by acknowledging the specific nature of social services of general interest where competition rules are concerned, bearing in mind that these services are strongly linked to local communities and rely on parties involved in the social economy. Mr De Rossa’s report is an opportunity to affirm principles that are simple and at the same strongly rooted in common sense, equality and universal access to these collectively run services, which contribute to social well-being and progress. Commissioner, you said: ‘The time has come to put ideas into practice.’ The time has come indeed, which is why I propose that in this debate you should provide real support for a European legislative instrument for public social services. I therefore call upon you to vote for the alternative motion for a resolution tabled by our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, cohesion policy must ensure harmonious and above all fair development between all territories. It is for this reason that we support the introduction of a new category of intermediary regions for the allocation of funds, as well as the application of new development indicators and indicators for social justice, well-being and environmental justice. We regret that this does not appear in the Pieper report. For the sake of fairness, cohesion policy must also tackle sub-regional development inequalities to restore meaning to the word ‘cohesion’, that is to say this solidarity which is the added value of the European Union. To achieve this, it must focus on inequalities, especially within urban areas, which are particularly affected by new challenges – social, environmental – and that is a huge task. Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there. It will also promote a new sustainable city, desirable for all, a model that meets the environmental, energetic and socio-demographic challenges, but one which places the living environment and the well-being of its inhabitants at the heart of our concerns. I will end with a clear message: after 2013, cohesion policy must have at its disposal much-needed and stable resources to be able to exist. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I am delighted that this report has been adopted, since most of our ideas (climate, social cohesion, integrated and bottom-up approach, disadvantaged neighbourhoods, cross-funding and so on) are included. However, I do regret that with regard to implementing the urban dimension, there is not a clearer signal in favour of a more widespread use of general subsidies for direct management by towns. Furthermore, this report should have elaborated on opening up deprived neighbourhoods, the role of medium-sized towns in the urban agenda, as well as the battle for climate and social mixing in our towns. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

I welcome the ideas that have been taken forward, through the adoption of this report, to enhance synergies between policies with an impact on territories, on the one hand, and between funds, on the other hand, in particular by increasing financing and setting up multiregional programmes. I find it deplorable, however, that the involvement of local and regional powers in the decision-making process is not being viewed as a priority. Improving governance through the additional involvement of authorities with decentralised management capacities is the way to respond to the need for absorption, efficiency and simplification, all of which are desirable when implementing cohesion policy.

 By adopting this report, I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved, since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as ‘intermediate’ for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions. Karima Delli,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, first of all, I shall deal with the cultural and creative industries. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent. In this report, particular attention is paid to the working conditions in the sector, in particular, irregular income and insecure working relations, which call for an in-depth debate in order to take account of specific aspects, for instance, by fighting against discrimination in terms of remuneration, and to improve the match between job held and level of qualification. We want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content, and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards. Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes. I now turn to the ‘Youth on the Move’ scheme. Things are tough for young Europeans: whether accessing employment, education, accommodation, social services, they undergo what is tantamount to the ordeals of a social initiation ceremony. We need to restore their confidence in the future by providing adapted and ambitious answers. I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training. In this respect, I should like to stress the request, which I support, put to the European Commission, for a Green Paper on youth participation. Our report also highlights the idea of mobility, which should be accessible to all, and I welcome that. Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training. It would be regrettable to categorise young Europeans as either an educated elite, multilingual and confident in the future, or as young people left behind on the grounds that they do not have a Masters degree or because they are only doing manual work. I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme. I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people’s autonomy. Our report insists on the main desire of young people to be autonomous, to have access to healthcare in particular, and to have decent accommodation at a reasonable price. We all know that the young person who has no option but to work as well as study is heading towards failure in his/her studies. Finally, I am delighted that, in this House, it has been recognised that work placements should no longer be jobs in disguise, fully-fledged jobs. Work placements must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection. (Applause) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work. These women contribute to our economy, yet they suffer very poor working conditions and violations of their most basic rights. The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a ‘Convention on decent work for domestic workers’. This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards. The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as they have to commit to ratify this convention. At European level, we will also need to stop considering separately and systematically the immigration and labour policies. It is not right for domestic workers to be coerced into informal work, regardless of their rights, because of an immigration regulation that is too strict and ill-adapted. Karima Delli,

 Mr President, the United Nations report, published on 11 April, throws light on the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed in Sri Lanka in the conflict between the government forces of Mr Rajapaksa and the Tamil Tiger independence movement. The clashes in May and June 2009 gave rise to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and thousands of civilians lost their lives. We cannot accept the impunity of those responsible and of the authors of these crimes. The government of Mr Rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the UN report and it even contests its conclusions. In Sri Lanka, the press is muzzled, and journalists are subject to intimidation and arbitrary detention. The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations. The Tamil minority is the victim of a genocide that dare not speak its name. We must urgently send European Parliament observers to the north of Sri Lanka to see what is really happening there and reassert the principle of the self-determination of peoples.

 Mr Tannock, I used that word by way of a metaphor, above all, to label the phenomenon. However, I have made it clear that it was not the name. The facts have to be established.

 The European Parliament adopted a report, this Tuesday 5 April 2011, on fighting violence against women. This text emphasises the specific nature of violence against women and girls by men: it is indeed one of the most common and harmful obstacles to gender equality. Today’s report will make it possible to implement a criminal-law instrument in the form of a European Union directive to combat gender-based violence. Indeed, it establishes a European charter, which will ensure a minimum level of assistance, including the right to free legal aid and urgent psychological aid services. Furthermore, MEPs are calling on the Commission to establish a European observatory on violence against women. Thanks to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, an adopted amendment also calls for Member States to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship, as a crime.

 The European Parliament has voted in favour of the principle of creating a single work and residence permit for third-country nationals in a Member State. This procedure provides a set of common rights for these workers, particularly with regard to working conditions, such as working time and holidays. The text also sets out the principle of reimbursing pension contributions already made by workers who leave the EU, since they will be unable to receive their pensions after they retire. This text is problematic, however, since it reinforces the ‘country of origin’ principle for some categories of workers, a principle that was fought by the European left during the time of the famous ‘Bolkestein’ Directive. This principle creates a kind of two-speed labour market depending on the worker’s origin, and contributes to a form of social dumping. There is a contradiction here: do we really want to protect the European social model, and should it exclude non-European workers, or should it take a universalist approach and stop discriminating against workers by giving them different rights? This text does not yet resolve this fundamental issue, which is why I decided to abstain from voting on the text. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Parliament has adopted a good text. It emphasises Europe’s important role in ensuring the social inclusion of the Roma within the European Union, with the application of this strategy at local level. The report points out that a strategy for the Roma is possible only with the cooperation of members of the community – in short, we must work ‘with’ before we work ‘for’. The Roma should therefore be involved in any decision making. The text points out the difficult living conditions, discrimination and difficulties in accessing essential services that the Roma suffer. It points out the need to ensure respect for the freedom of movement of European citizens. It also mentions the importance, in social inclusion terms, of social protection, vocational training, education and public service provision. It denounces the insufficient allocation of funds, when the money could be put to good use. However, the real drawback of this report is the insistence by the conservatives in the European Parliament on mentioning the need to combat the Roma people’s so-called ‘prolonged dependence’ on the social welfare system. This is a scandalous prejudice aimed once again at marginalising the Roma community. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 This text does not stand out for its quality, since it is the result of a very broad compromise between the MEPs. It contains both elements that are very positive in the eyes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and certain ideas that we have sought in vain to denounce. However, the main thing is that it enables MEPs to express a rather progressive opinion on the EU 2020 strategy’s flagship programme dedicated to industry. Hence, the text calls for transport systems to be made more sustainable through the use of more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions. It points out the need to place energy and resource savings at the heart of European industrial policy. In this respect, it recalls the huge job potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield. The adoption of measures that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors. MEPs also sought to encourage all the efforts made to redress skills shortages in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry.

 I welcome the vote on this report on equality between men and women. In terms of remuneration, for example, and despite continued legislative efforts on the subject at European level, women still earn 18% less on average than men for the same work in the European Union. I would also like to emphasise that we had to battle for a long time within this Parliament merely to ensure that such a basic right as access to contraception could be mentioned. This kind of rearguard debate does little for the reputation of the European right. Luckily, the final report is a good one. It sets the objective of reducing the pay gap to less than 5% by 2020 and, in particular, calls on the Member States to do all they can to enforce the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’, with sanctions for non-compliant States. It calls for binding objectives to ensure equality in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

While today, the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative – a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion – this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 million people living in poverty in Europe, over 5 million homeless, millions poorly housed, one in five children victims of poverty, and, at the other end of the scale, what do we have? The number of billionaires is increasing. We have just held the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October and the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will soon draw to a close, but what will we have to show for this? What concrete solutions will Europe have offered to those who are the primary victims of a crisis for which they are not responsible? What hope can we offer my generation, this European generation bearing the brunt of unemployment, insecurity and exclusion, these young people who are mistrustful of Europe, who expect a lot from Europe and therefore from you? We are duty bound to answer their day-to-day concerns and their anxieties over the future. The Lisbon strategy has failed in its mission to eradicate poverty. We can no longer stand by idly and let things happen. Now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetoric. The time has come to be bold and show some political courage. All the organisations working with victims of poverty, ATD Fourth World, the European Anti-poverty Network (EAPN), the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), Emmaüs Europe, have been demanding this for 20 years! That is why we are asking the European Commission for a framework directive which aims to set an adequate minimum income. This framework directive will ensure eligibility for and access to an adequate minimum income so that any child, adult or elderly person living in poverty can break free from it, thus guaranteeing them their inalienable right to live in dignity. Time is running out, ladies and gentlemen, the need for action has never been more urgent. Together, we can put an end to the outrageous scandal that is long-term poverty. Poverty, end poverty, this should not be just a slogan. It is a reality and together, I hope, we will take on this battle. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Courard, Commissioner, the principal objective of the European Union, an objective which appears in the Treaty of Lisbon, is the development of a social market economy oriented towards full employment and social progress. It therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment, adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all EU policies. The recognition of social rights and, in particular, of the right to access services of general interest, is made binding in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter contains rights and principles, such as the right to access social security payments, housing benefits and social services. On the eve of the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, initiated by Parliament, how can you claim that, in applying the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, only the rules on competition and the internal market need apply to these social services of general interest, with no adaptation to their specific modes of organisation and financing? Is it not true that the Services Directive, for example, calls into question the role of social services of general interest with a strong local base consisting of community members who are not aiming for financial gain? When will you stop burying your head in the sand and when will you finally shoulder your responsibility as colegislator, in accordance with the provisions of the new Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the positive progress that this directive represents in the face of the urgent need to combat climate change. 2010 is the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The European Partnership for Energy and the Environment (EPEE) estimates that between 50 and 125 million Europeans suffer from energy poverty. However, this new legislation concerns only new buildings and will affect only 2.7 million new homes per year, when there are 200 million old homes in the European Union. The fact is, at least 150 million homes will have to be renovated by 2050 in order to attain factor 4. Commissioner, since 2007, 4% of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has been set aside to improve the energy performance of buildings, but has been used only to a very limited extent. How, then, are you going to put pressure on the Member States to really use these funds, because if they go unused, they are liable to disappear from 2013, when some of them will actually have to be increased?

Mr President, 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and it is in this context that we shall adopt, I hope, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij, which represents a major advance in the improvement of the living conditions of disadvantaged populations, insofar as it makes eligible for European aid, via the ERDF, projects for renovating and building housing and for combating energy poverty in all the Member States. This proposal, which is supported by the Council of Europe, has long been awaited by all those who campaign for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities, and particularly of the Roma. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the fact that the Union is investing heavily in the improvement of housing for the most disadvantaged communities, but we must not stop now that we are doing so well. We will be very vigilant with regard to the actual use of these funds, since they must not result in the exclusion of marginalised communities. Indeed, there are numerous examples of urban renovation projects. They include the restoration of the city centre of Barcelona, and the work to regenerate the historic centres in the new Member States, which have done particularly well out of real estate speculation through the explosion in rent and rental charges. This, in turn, has led to the most disadvantaged families being driven away from the city centres. These people absolutely must receive genuine social support and access to all public services, such as education, health care and public transport, but – as we proposed during the examination in committee – they must also receive resources sufficient to enable them to remain in these neighbourhoods, so that the latter do not become gentrified. Parliament will have to evaluate the projects carried out before these funds are renewed in 2013 and will have to be involved in drafting the future regulation laying down the eligibility criteria, particularly in relation to transparency, so as to ensure that every single vulnerable population actually receives these funds and is afforded a dignified existence in the long term.

Madam President, President Václav Havel’s speech to our House highlighted one of the fundamental principles of the European Union: solidarity among human beings. We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that wall of shame. Following 9 November 1989, we were told that humanity would finally be set free. Democracy and human rights were supposed to extend to the entire planet, knocking down walls, removing barriers between peoples. However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent? The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the Sri Lankan Government has maintained a wall of silence regarding the situation of the Tamil civilian population, preventing foreign media and humanitarian organisations from gaining access to them. Since March 2009, Colombo has been holding almost all of the civilians who fled the fighting between the army and the Tamil Tigers, in complete violation of international law and human rights. In July, the Sri Lankan Government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north-east of the island. The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases. In some camps, more than 1 000 people are dying every week, mainly of dysentery. The living conditions are appalling. President Rajapaksa declared last week that only 100 000 Tamil refugees would be released. In view of the scale of the tragedy, the European Union must step up the pressure on the Sri Lankan Government in order to obtain the immediate and unconditional release of all the civilians, access to the camps for journalists and the prompt delivery of humanitarian aid.

Mr President, my speech concerns the deterioration in working conditions in Europe. Today, nearly half of the people working in the world earn less than USD 2 a day. 12.3 million people are still victims of slavery, and more than 200 million children are forced to work. In Europe, the number of working poor is increasing day by day, and each year the International Labour Organisation records 160 000 deaths linked to a lack of prevention. In this context, I would like to emphasise our responsibility towards all those who are deprived of jobs and social rights, who work in unfit conditions, towards those millions of workers who suffer mentally and physically, who are, at times, driven to suicide, or who are victims of cancers or chronic diseases caused by their working conditions. It is time to break with the religion that dictates that we must work harder, and to stop the race to make profits and to compete in the short term. Guaranteeing the right to decent work and strengthening labour law must be the Union’s top priority over the next 10 years. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleagues have said, the image of the European Union that Erasmus gives is a good one. Endangering this standard-bearer for the European Union, which has done so much to create a positive image and which meets the needs of young people at a time when many of our fellow citizens are having doubts about the European project, is tragic. The Council representatives present have underlined the many problems there are in 2012 and also concerning the future funding of Erasmus, but have not given any firm answers. The question being put to the Member States today, on which there is a consensus in Parliament, is this: are you going to increase your contributions to its funding to meet the commitments you have made? Quite apart from Erasmus, the issue of funding for education programmes and also for the Cohesion Fund is equally tragic. Personally, I am a supporter of independent financing of the EU budget, which would liberate us from the Member States’ erratic decision-making. Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ever since President Mubarak’s fall in February 2011, Egypt has been run by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which gave itself the powers to legislate and to draft the Constitution. How can we not be worried? It was against this backdrop that Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, was elected on 24 June. For many Egyptian women, Mohamed Morsi's election jeopardises women’s rights. It should be pointed out that Islamist MPs had previously proposed reforming a provision that allows women to divorce without their husband’s consent. Similarly, they tried to pass a law banning women from seeking a divorce. Women must be listened to and their demands heard. Without them, democracy in Egypt will not be possible. They call for the provisions of the Charter on Women's Rights to be implemented in Egypt, a charter established last year by more than a thousand women and approved by half a million Egyptian citizens, men and women alike. This document sanctions fundamental rights such as the right to participate in political and economic life, representation in government and equality before the law. The Egyptian legal system must protect women against all forms of violence. We absolutely must support these demands, demands which are legitimate. Will Baroness Ashton support them? What steps will she consider to support Egypt on the road to democracy? How can we, as Europeans, respond to the concerns of these young people and women who fear that the arrival of the Islamists … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to add a few words to what Mr Alfonsi has said, and to applaud his work. Macro-regional strategies offer very interesting prospects for decentralised collaborative projects in the Mediterranean region. I think they provide an appropriate framework for the problems of this region, where, in the light of last year’s events, we must develop active neighbourhood policies, aimed at young people in particular. I would like to stress three particular points from my opinion. The first is cooperation in the field of youth, by promoting the European programmes designed for them, and through synergies with the work of the Mediterranean Office for Youth, which needs to be more publicised. The second is the creation of networks between Euro-Mediterranean universities and the removal of obstacles to the movement of students, lecturers and researchers, by simplifying visa procedures for these groups in particular. This is essential and urgent. The third is the quality of teaching and research in these networks, to be achieved by supporting and adequately funding the Tempus and Erasmus Mundus programmes and, I must stress, by automatically granting visas to these groups when they join the European programmes. Thank you to Mr Alfonsi for his productive collaboration, and thank you to all the Members who contributed to this report. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of Volunteering 2011 served to put volunteering under the spotlight and to give the voluntary sector an opportunity to put forward valuable recommendations. I congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission for their contributions on this issue. Mr Scurria’s report highlights the importance of ensuring that all citizens have access to volunteering activities and have the right to make their own contribution in order to support altruism and solidarity in their local area. Volunteering and community work as a whole represent an antidote to the changes in the labour market and to the risk of excluding parts of the population from enjoying basic goods and services. For our group, volunteering must not be a new way of getting people into insecure employment. It is about clearly differentiating between the value of volunteering, provided free of charge, and profit-making activities. Furthermore, we encourage Member States to recognise the rights of volunteers and to use the European Charter on the Rights and Responsibilities of Volunteers as a point of reference.

This report supports the Commission’s policy of taking a liberal approach. Deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) entail the dismantling of tariff barriers and opening of markets and may weaken these emerging economies. Social, environmental, educational and cultural issues are not addressed sufficiently, contrary to the aspirations of the people. Furthermore, DCFTAs are the result of a long process with strict criteria, particularly the obligation to align with European internal market regulations. In addition, these numerous requirements are not related to the prospect of integration into the European Union, as may have been the case for the countries of Eastern Europe. Do we need reminding of the EU’s failure in relation to the Mediterranean? These agreements focus on bilateral relations, failing to provide support for the regional integration of these countries. Instead, such agreements pit these countries against each other for the honour of being ‘champions’ who meet their criteria. At a time when Europeans are considering the possibility of European protectionism, we are demanding the opposite from our Southern partners. Is that really consistent? Is it fair? I do not believe so and that is why I am voting against this report, despite the fact that it does have some positive aspects. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, we cannot remain indifferent to or silent about the tragic situation suffered by the Syrian people as they face Bashar al-Assad’s bloody regime. We cannot abandon the Syrian people. First, let us firmly state our support for, and solidarity with, the Syrian people who are suffering. What strategy shall we build? What can we do? First, condemn the veto exercised at the UN by the Chinese and Russian governments and demand that NGOs and journalists be allowed to operate on Syrian territory. Next, support the people by supplying the medicines and medical equipment that they are lacking, bearing in mind that even rural hospitals are being attacked. Medicine cannot be used as a weapon. It is also important to contribute to the setting up of a humanitarian corridor. Finally, we must recognise and support the Syrian opposition around the Syrian National Council so that they can rebuild a state that matches the aspirations of the Syrian people. Furthermore, we must send Assad and those responsible for crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to two points regarding two of our partners on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. The first point is the concern of many Algerians regarding current reforms and, in particular, the law on associations to be voted on in the Algerian Parliament. Algerian civil society is concerned that this law could stifle society as a result of two new things that it introduces. Firstly, all associations will have to apply for a licence in order to exist. Secondly, foreign funding, including European, will no longer be allowed. The second point is that in Tunisia, at a time when the rule of law is being established and a new constitution negotiated, independent judges want our support so that they have the means to work towards establishing an independent judiciary and the training of Tunisian judges in transitional justice. Commissioner, will you respond to these concerns and these demands? Malika Benarab-Attou

 Mr President, at a time when Tunisia has just held its first democratic elections, the Member States of the European Union are still struggling to support the aspirations of those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and to demonstrate real solidarity. The Council’s reactions to the revolutions in the countries on the southern shore can no longer be limited to declarations of principle and short-term objectives. The European Union must move up a gear by proposing concrete, long-term measures. This is the purpose of this resettlement programme. The conclusion – at last – of the ordinary legislative procedure on this issue and, by extension, the application by all the Member States of the common European programme on the resettlement of refugees, at a historic moment in time, would bear witness to our will to react effectively by working together to propose suitable instruments. Currently, only 10 Member States participate annually in the resettlement of refugees, and there is no proper coordination when they do. Yet the representatives of the EU Member States have said again in recent months that they support the peoples’ aspirations. This support for the people of partner countries must result in Europe showing solidarity by accommodating refugees. The European resettlement programme should be an additional tool for protecting refugees and asylum seekers. It should allow for the implementation of a European hospitality policy for resettled populations. It needs to be implemented urgently. We must break the deadlock before the end of 2011, and it is up to the Council to do this. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Bastos, for her work and fruitful working relationship with the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, of which I am one. We agree with the Commission’s observation as regards the need to raise the qualification levels of young Europeans as well as the need to redefine certain skills that students might need today. We must not limit our proposals to satisfying the needs of labour market areas; we must also guarantee fair and universal access to quality public education and lifelong learning, so as to promote the intellectual and social development of every citizen, and particularly of young people, given the unacceptably high rate of unemployment among that age group. In order to achieve this, I believe there are two crucial aspects: firstly, digital literacy, which is becoming increasingly important for our evolving knowledge-based society. Emphasis must be placed, first and foremost, on literacy-based initiatives, and on refreshing and updating key skills in the field of communication and information technology, so as to reduce, or indeed eliminate, the digital divide. The next step for the Member States, therefore, is to integrate digital culture into teaching and training systems, while teaching a critical approach to modern forms of communication and media content. Secondly, and more generally, education and training have a place in the Green New Deal that we environmentalists wish to implement in the European Union. Indeed, we need to start by speeding up the transition towards a sustainable economy and developing the huge potential for green jobs that exists throughout Europe, with a view to protecting and restoring environmental quality and the quality of life of our fellow citizens across a wide range of sectors, such as transport, energy supply and even public services … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, how much longer are we going to ask Tunisians indirectly to bear the dramatic consequences of our poor management of aid to the refugees? The solidarity shown by Tunisian society is crumbling. We can no longer remain indifferent to the health situation and the new outbreaks of diseases in the camps. It has to be recognised that we, the European Union, have failed on several points: an inhumane migration policy; shameful humanitarian aid measures to tackle the huge needs on the ground; a lack of European solidarity, calling into question the very foundations of Europe. How do we, as European defenders of human rights, see ourselves? What support is the European Union talking about when it addresses people who have, today, effected their democratic revolution? We have the resources to help these refugees but, if there is no political will or tangible force, the Mediterranean will remain a cemetery. Is this acceptable? Can we continue in this way? We must reconsider the issue of the refugees and migration on the basis of a human rights approach taking into account the new political situations. The security approach and the ‘dusting’ carried out by the Frontex Agency are no match for our high standards and values. In the short, medium and long term, the financial assistance given by the European Union must be directed at strengthening the capacities of civil society in Tunisia, in particular, and in the countries of the south more generally. I should like to conclude by stressing that the immigrants of today are resources and not a burden. Am I not an example? Yesterday an immigrant, today a Member of the European Parliament.

 Madam President, the peoples of the southern Mediterranean expect a strong gesture of solidarity and support from us amid the upheaval and the challenges they face. These are peoples whom we colonised in the recent past, which means that we have an added responsibility. In supporting their democratic transition, we must devise, here in Europe, a true policy of hospitality that is consistent with our value of fraternity. Devising a policy of hospitality means, first of all, reviewing the reception conditions at our borders and ensuring that the fundamental rights of those who cross them are respected. It also means finding a solution for the thousands of young people who are dying in the Mediterranean, before our very eyes. This is unacceptable. This report, despite including new clauses on respect for human rights and fundamental rights in Frontex’s mandate, is not aimed at a new policy of hospitality. Despite the proposed changes, Frontex’s mandate is still confined to a repressive ‘fortress Europe’ attitude. We must continue our efforts to guarantee more thorough assessments of Frontex operations, with the help of an independent monitoring body, so as to ensure respect for democracy and fundamental rights set out in our report.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the demands for democracy, freedom and dignity of the peoples of the southern Mediterranean call for action from us here in Europe, their northern Mediterranean neighbours. We have taken too long to respond – or, in some cases, not to respond – to these long-standing needs, in keeping with the values that we preach. First Algeria, then Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Morocco, Jordan: the people of the southern Mediterranean are reminding us of a longing to be able to live according to the universal values of equality, freedom and brotherhood. The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) might be the project on which our new relationship could be based, around common values of solidarity and respect for the law. However, the UfM has come up against Israel’s policies, as it continues to flout international law and to colonise Palestinian territory. The UfM summit has been cancelled twice because of this. It is time we put our words into action and stopped applying double standards. Baroness Ashton, will you dare to take action that will allow the Palestinian state to exist within its 1967 borders and lift the blockade on Gaza? The time has come to do this if we do not want to lose credibility in the eyes of our southern neighbours. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the G8 countries decided to grant the sum of USD 40 billion to Tunisia and Egypt, as has already been said. However, the European Union must present the case for greater transparency, visibility and traceability; in short, better governance of this aid. We need to focus on four key points: first, ensuring that development cooperation is in keeping with the principles of democracy and absolute transparency; second, guaranteeing respect for human rights; strengthening the role and capacities of civil society organisations and reforming the system of governance that applies to aid, with stronger involvement by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, the EU must be able to guarantee that this aid reaches the people it is intended for. What concrete measures is the EU planning in this respect? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports by Mrs Schaake and Mrs Sanchez-Schmid remind us that culture is not a decoration motif but the fruit of complex interdependencies, showing that cultural questions should be addressed in a transverse manner and integrated into all European policies, internal as well as external, social as well as economic. In this respect, I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees, with the European Commission’s other services, as well as with Baroness Ashton’s European External Action Service. Furthermore, I would like to come back to a point that has not been expanded on in these reports, concerning the mobility of artists and of professionals in the cultural sector. Indeed, this issue is of major importance for the emergence of a European cultural area. In this regard, two aspects seem to me to be important; namely, firstly, the dissemination by the European Union and Member States of clear and understandable information on regulations and procedures currently in force. Secondly, the removal – as has already been said – of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union. I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas. Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries. Therefore, Europe should reposition itself and not abandon the battle over soft power, since what is at stake here today is respect for cultural diversity as a tool for dialogue and as a guarantee of peace and stability worldwide.

 Madam President, Commissioner, in your description of the outlook for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the Southern Mediterranean, you referred to potential catalysts. However, you forgot to mention one group, to which I myself belong. In Europe, people like me –immigrants and the children of immigrants – who come from the area that was once colonised by Europe, are still stigmatised. Yet we are, and we could become, human resources: influential mediators between north and south at this historic time. Commissioner Füle, what are your thoughts on that option? Will you take it into consideration? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, this report is sensitive, and I must criticise its title. The use of the words ‘migration flows’ sets the tone: it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or invaders. These are historic times for the peoples of the Southern Mediterranean and us, but the fear of mass immigration is preventing the EU and the Member States from creating a new dynamic. The recent democratic movements in the South have helped make us aware of our contradictions. They have demonstrated once again the inconsistency and lack of vision of our obsolete and out-of-touch cooperation policies. It is high time the European Union implemented a migration policy that is consistent with our values, that recognises that we live in a world in which people are mobile, a world in which human beings move around. To continue to talk about migration flows is absurd and goes against our humanist values. If we Europeans want to be major players in the world, then we have to change our approach and work towards creating a solidarity-based Union for the Mediterranean; we cannot do so without revising mobility policy, or what is today referred to as migration policy. We must meet the expectations of the peoples of the South. The fear of immigration must no longer guide our policies. Strengthening border controls must no longer be our main motivation in implementing cooperation agreements, as it was in the case of Libya. We must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements, so that we respect human rights. Our actions are still characterised by a security-driven approach to mobility, which goes against our values and the requirement we have to protect populations. The scandalous position adopted by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Guéant must be vigorously denounced. Commissioner, what kind of policy must we adopt in order to establish a true Union for the Mediterranean, one in which we show solidarity with the peoples of the South, who today feel scorned by us?

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, having mistakenly supported dictatorial regimes along the southern coast of the Mediterranean, supposedly as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism, we now need to rise to the challenge presented by these historic events. Europe needs to revise its current policy on authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. President Mubarak must step down now. It behoves us to support the democracies and democratic processes chosen by the people of these countries, not simply to impose our own vision. Let us listen to their voices, let us exercise humility, let us not confuse secularism and security. Change is already happening in these countries.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), two out of thirteen cross-border cooperation programmes are dedicated to the Mediterranean Basin. The first is the cooperation programme for the Mediterranean Basin. With the new generation of European funds for 2007-2013, the European Union has decided to resolutely develop cooperation actions between the north and south shores of the Mediterranean. To this end, the European Union has established the Mediterranean Sea Basin ENPI programme. What territories exactly does this programme apply to? What projects could be co-financed, given that we know that the cooperation programme finances 80% of the total cost of the cooperation programmes in which partner programmes representing at least three eligible countries in a very wide range of fields participate? The second part of the ENPI cross-border programme for Italy and Tunisia has a total allocation for 2007-2013 of EUR 25 191 million. The eligible regions are in Italy and Tunisia. The management authority is the region of Sicily, with Palermo. The objective of the cross-border cooperation programme for Italy and Tunisia is to encourage economic, institutional and cultural integration of the Tunisian and Sicilian regions through a process of joint sustainable development in the context of cross-border cooperation. The programme has three priorities. The first is regional development and regional integration. The second is to encourage sustainable development, through the management of agricultural and fisheries resources, to protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage and to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. My question is as follows: what measures have been put in place to monitor the trade in coral, a fisheries resource that is endangered and the subject of illegal trafficking? The third priority is cultural and scientific cooperation, and support for networks, by strengthening cooperation at association level, training and exchanges between young people and students. My question is as follows: how, beyond the objective of funding, do we ensure that this programme of human exchanges takes place given the obstacles associated with the implementation of the Return Directive by European countries and the management of Schengen visas?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Alps are one of the most heavily built-up mountain regions in Europe. They contain the most important water resources, but their current economic situation makes them vulnerable to global warming.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive drying-up of the Jordan River is a direct consequence of the tragedy that Palestine is experiencing. Water is a highly political issue. Let us not forget that. Let us remember some facts: the World Bank informs us that, for two years, the one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been without chlorine, which is essential for disinfecting the water; 50% of homes did not have access to water before the bombings of January 2009, so imagine what it is like now. Médecins sans Frontières
 say that, now, following the attacks by the Israeli army on the infrastructure, 90% of the water supplied to the inhabitants is unfit for human consumption. Every day, 80 million litres of untreatable sewage is discharged into our Mediterranean as a result of the destruction inflicted on the infrastructure in Gaza. It is true that Baroness Ashton has visited Gaza on several occasions, but where is the political courage to apply to Israel the same standards as we have in Europe? Must clean water, like the land, be monopolised by the Israeli settlers? Consequently, the European Union must suspend the association agreement with the current Israeli Government, which remains deaf to all our requests, whilst the occupation and the settlements, which are illegal, remain. Without justice, there will be no peace. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the situation imposed on the Roma – their expulsion and the denial of their right to free movement in Europe – is unacceptable and goes against European values. However, this situation is but the symptom of a more serious and more general problem. It is merely the reflection of a disease in our so-called modern societies, where we are losing sight of what binds us together as human beings. No, human beings are not commodities that can be stocked and destocked. The policy that we, as the European Union, follow on issues relating to the movement of persons within the Union and to entry and exit from third countries is unacceptable. We cannot pursue this policy of a besieged and timid Europe. The free movement of persons is fundamental. It has always been so, and it is the foundation on which our present-day societies are built. Today, equality is no longer guaranteed where the movement of European and non-European citizens is concerned. While European tourists and pensioners travel freely and in huge numbers to the South, especially to the Maghreb, the citizens of those same countries are unable to move around. The Schengen visas and their application by the EU Member States are inhuman. The considerable barriers to movement prevent citizens of the South from coming to the countries of the North as tourists, friends or family members. President Barroso, what action – bold, concrete action – are you going to take to enable us to adhere to our values once again on this issue? Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean has never been as vital to our future as it is today. Together we have tried, in the report on the UfM, to support a different vision of our Mediterranean. More than just a simple free trade zone, it is a Union founded on the common civilisation of people who share fundamental values. I should like to talk about the most serious obstacle to our Mediterranean ambitions; the violence suffered by the Palestinian people, who are being occupied, expelled and killed by Israel, while Europe fails to assume its historic responsibility in this conflict and really act for peace by recognising the State of Palestine in accordance with the international laws on which our democracies are founded. This coming week, an official Parliament delegation will visit the Gaza Strip in a bid to understand why aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro which Europeans are sending Palestinians is not arriving in the schools and hospitals in Gaza, which I visited in January. I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided, without informing either his members – of whom I am one – or the co-chairs of this delegation, not to visit Gaza with Parliament’s delegation on the instructions of the Israeli Embassy. By boycotting Parliament’s delegation to Gaza, our committee chair is discrediting the whole of Parliament, which passed a resolution on the Goldstone report condemning the fact that contacts with the populations in Gaza were being blocked by the Israeli army and demanding that the block be lifted immediately. We need to remember this resolution and Parliament’s position. This being so, I call for Mr Albertini to resign as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, for failing to meet the demands of his office. What is the point of financing and supervising elections, if we then refuse to recognise those who have chosen the ballot box over arms? Finally, another obstacle to a really fraternal Union for the Mediterranean is the victims who drown on their way from the south side, partly due to the fact that European borders are completely closed to them. Our current migration policy is no longer acceptable. We need to be able, as the UNDP recommends, to ensure that the mobility of citizens from the South is equal to our own mobility to the South. We must be faithful to our project and to our values. Our children will thank us for it and we will be the proud representatives of our peoples. Malika Benarab-Attou,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the value of this report in opening up the debate, within our Parliament, on the position and role of universities in Europe. These universities must, in fact, be encouraged to participate in European integration from the inside rather than to contemplate it from the outside. Over the course of European history, universities have always been places where meetings are held, knowledge is exchanged, thought is developed and training is delivered in the various disciplines. Today, the effects of the crisis and of unemployment must not result in universities restricting their role as providers of professionals who are immediately ready to work because, in our changing societies, the ability to change jobs is becoming vital. On the contrary, universities, as places of higher education and training, must also enable learners to become critical, analytical thinkers, because this will enable them to understand the world in which we live and to use their professional skills wisely. European universities must create the conditions for lifelong learning, contribute to the enrichment of intellectual life and play a central role in the knowledge-based society of today’s digital age.

Mr President, President of the European Investment Bank, in the EIB’s 2008 report, Parliament insisted that the bank’s external activities comply with the general objectives of the European Union. That is why the project to finance a nuclear power station in Jordan would go against the foundations of Article 3(5) of the Treaty on European Union. I quote, ‘In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the sustainable development of the Earth’. In February 2009, the Jordanian authorities contacted the EIB seeking support for their nuclear energy development project, which involves, in particular, the construction of a nuclear power station by 2016. It is therefore with some satisfaction that I have received the assurance of your services that the European Investment Bank did not grant this request and that it considers that its job is to support projects in Jordan aimed at developing wind and solar power, which are energies of the future for our planet because they are renewable. Will this position be pursued for other requests to finance nuclear power stations? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europeana project is taking on a new, ambitious dimension. With this EU digital library, the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible. It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project. A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. One of our continent’s horizons is Africa, but we have blackened that horizon with slavery and colonialism. We have a duty of recognition and reparation towards its peoples. Financial compensation could not meet this need alone, but thanks to the Europeana project, we can help to return to the African peoples part of their culture in terms of its oral literature. Amadou Hampâté Bâ, a Malian intellectual, said: ‘In Africa, when an old person dies, it is a library that burns’. Working to digitise works of oral literature, which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists, and encouraging free access to them through the Europeana project, thereby making them universal in scale, would be a way of protecting and giving life to humanity’s cultural diversity, to which we are all attached.

 Mr President, I am wondering what actions the European Union will introduce to ensure that all Member States observe the right of asylum and respect the human rights of people arriving from the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Many of them are arriving in flimsy craft, and several thousand Africans are drowning without anyone protesting. Are the Council and the Commission really sensitive to these issues, which fall under the headings of both human rights and humanitarian aid? Mr Moratinos’s statements with regard to the strengthening of the security approach and the additional resources allocated to Frontex, decided recently by the Council, do not reassure me in this regard. Ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to act to bring our actions into line with our values. This is urgent, because there are lives at risk. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, on 14 January, I met with members of the Tunisian delegation. We had a frank exchange and debated our respective views. As a Franco-Algerian, I am committed to the Maghreb and I campaign for a united, pluralist and democratic Maghreb. The issue of human rights is crucially important to me, and it is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. The debate on this issue, as it appears in Tunisia, is crucial and relevant. Yesterday morning, I met Mr Ben Brik’s wife, who is leading a hunger strike, as well as activists from the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, and I am concerned. It seems that Mr Ben Brik’s life is in danger due to his illness and his detention conditions. I am sure you realise that if this concern should become a reality, the responsibility will fall very heavily on the shoulders of the Tunisian authorities. Aside from trade relations, we must also take account of social issues. The phenomenon of young Tunisians throwing themselves into the Mediterranean is the product of a closed society that offers no prospects to its young people. The defence against fundamentalism and economic imperatives must not serve as pretexts for ignoring human rights. Real progress in the field of human rights is now crucial. We are not talking here about sanctimonious dogmatism but about an urgent situation that the European Union must help to resolve. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr Barroso, I would like to inform you that, in a few days’ time, we will be observing the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The situation of the crushed, colonised, wounded, killed Palestinian population must not continue. We Europeans, through our values of solidarity and fraternity, have a responsibility to find a solution to this situation quickly, before it turns into a bloodbath. The Israeli Government is continuing its colonisations by forced march, and this after it committed war crimes at the start of this year. Symbols and tears are no longer enough. Today, the only solution to stop this deadly policy of the Israeli Government is the recognition and, above all, the existence of the Palestinian State. The Palestinian people, like other peoples, have a right to a dignified existence that fulfils their aspirations. As President of the Commission, and together with Mrs Ashton, will you take action along these lines and, if so, how? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied by the response that Commissioner Dimas was able to give on this issue and, in particular, by his speaking of the importance of aid beyond the borders of our continent. In addition to environmental protection of the Mediterranean Sea, might one formally propose, as part of the Union for the Mediterranean project, this emergency aid in the event of fire and the development of forestry expertise on this subject, to be shared and developed with the non-European countries of the Union for the Mediterranean?

 Mr President, Commissioners, in my view there has been an extraordinary degree of misinformation during this debate. Why? Because, in the first instance, we had an exhibition – I think Polish Members arranged it – that looks as if it is on the part of citizens but, when you look more closely, it turns out it is financed by a coalition of shale gas industry associations. I would say that is false advertising; it is masquerading as something it is not! That is the problem we have with this exhibition. Secondly, you may have forgotten, but the Commissioners mentioned it, there are reports which the Commission requested. I would ask you to read them carefully, because the report on the environment shows all too clearly that there is a risk of polluting surface water and groundwater and of depleting water resources. The impact on the soil can be devastating and can also lead to atmospheric pollution. Yet people say there are no such risks. It is not a question of being for or against shale gas, because decisions on energy mix are a question of national sovereignty. Our task, as elected officials, as MEPs, is to protect the European public. These reports show that there are clearly identified shortcomings in the legislation: poor adaptation of the Water Framework Directive, management of waste needs to be integrated into the Mining Waste Directive, and fracking needs to be integrated into the Environmental Impact Assessments Directive. If we do not overcome these failings, we will face serious difficulties, as seen in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, companies should be fully liable. They should have to prove that they have sufficient financial guarantees to honour the polluter pays principle in the event of environmental damage. It is not up to industry to decide what our energy future will be, but up to the citizens. Finally, with the support of around a hundred MEPs, we have tabled an amendment calling for a moratorium on fracking in the European Union. I hope as many MEPs as possible will remember their responsibilities when it comes to voting and will show that lobbyists do not hold all the power in Brussels.

 Mr President, Mr Grzyb, I would like to stress that Poland is in breach of the Water Framework Directive. You have already been asked to adhere to the standards laid down in that directive. The second problem with fracking is its social acceptability. The Commissioner mentioned this earlier. When people are made aware that exploitation comes with risks, it is still up to them to decide, as was the case in France and Bulgaria. At the same time, in relation to the risk presented by CO2
, which came up just now, shale gas cannot replace all sources of energy. You have to develop renewables. Europe is doing just that, Commissioner Oettinger spoke about it, and you also have the opportunity to do so in Poland. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I have a similar question. The problem with this exhibition is not that industrialists want to hold an exhibition. There’s no problem with that, but they must say that they are industrialists. When we have NGOS, they say they are NGOs. The problem here is the attempt to deceive us: we do not know who they really are, and when you scratch beneath the surface, as Mr Turmes said, you find out they are actually from the shale gas industry. That is what is not right and not the fact that lobbies can come to Parliament to try to influence people. There must be total transparency about who people are. Michèle Rivasi,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since we are going to give our opinion this week on the discharge of European agencies that are under suspicion about their management, since our institutions are deemed to be too open to the lobbies and it seems that the transparency measures taken so far have not succeeded in resolving these problems, since we rightly want exemplary, certified institutions without any conflicts of interest, since the Commission’s reputation is once again in tatters, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but also on behalf of numerous other Members of the European Parliament of all political persuasions, I want to ask you about the resignation of John Dalli and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, which has been planned for a long time. This unexpected affair is intriguing and has left me somewhat bewildered. There is something fishy about this alleged story of corruption and we have the right to find out all the details. Of course, Commissioners must not be above the law. They must answer for themselves like any other citizen. However, nor must Commissioners must be beneath the law and I have the feeling that John Dalli is being deprived of basic rights and, in particular, the presumption of innocence while there is no concrete and direct proof of his guilt. Several questions come to mind, therefore, and I would like the Commission to give us some insight into this affair. What legal provision, what regulation or what Treaty has Mr Dalli infringed with his behaviour? What is the Commission’s view of his alleged guilt? Is it not possible that this affair might be a manoeuvre to derail the Tobacco Products Directive? Commissioner, I would ask you to give us some details about this extraordinary situation and I call on OLAF to send us its report as soon as possible Moreover, I read Mr Barroso’s letter assuring us that the Tobacco Products Directive would not be postponed. However, we would like more information about the timetable, which is already more than a year behind. This long-awaited Directive is ready and I would ask the Commission to make every effort to implement it. Are we going to have to wait until Tonio Borg takes up his post? We believe that this is extremely urgent from a health perspective and that the Directive should therefore get back on track, because if we do not do it now, it will have to wait until the next parliamentary term. Who will win in that case? The tobacco lobby! Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially Mr Áder and Mr Seeber, for their valuable work on the revision of the Seveso Directive. As we debate the Seveso Directive, my thoughts turn to the accident that occurred in France, AZF – you will recall – in Toulouse. On 21 September 2001, a stock of ammonium nitrate exploded killing 31 people and wounding a further 2 500, who are still traumatised to this day. The damage caused was unbelievable. This was not due to the lack of risk assessment management. It was due to the subcontracting of subcontractors, that is to say, untrained people. The training of employees is also the best form of security. In any event, give or take a few minor details, I am pleased with the final result, in particular, the essential advances in the management of industrial risks, against which we need to protect our citizens in the race to underinvestment in safety features by integrating the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. This is very important for informing citizens in the interests of transparency, and it is a sine qua non
 of the organisation of an effective risk management plan. I have one reservation, Commissioner, which is that there is no assessment of the financial consequences of a major accident and proof of the capacity of companies to address them. That, in my opinion, is a shortcoming of this directive. Michèle Rivasi,

 Mr President, it is good that we have this resolution on water because it is proof of Parliament’s good intentions. I would like to highlight some problems. Firstly, in terms of water management. As we speak, the World Water Forum is being held in Marseille. Yet, as you know, there is strong criticism with regard to the conflict of interest arising from the fact that the president of this World Water Forum, Loïc Fauchon, is also the chief executive of the Marseille water service (Société des eaux de Marseille
), an affiliate of Veolia. This has therefore become a commercial forum rather than a general interest to see water become a shared global resource. In terms of water management, it is very important that water management is reallocated to local authorities under direct state supervision. This forum ended with a declaration claiming that private investment can guarantee the right to water, which logically leads the debate towards the privatisation of water systems. This is a problem for both European and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The second problem concerns water and health. When we see that 88% of the diseases in the world come from drinking dirty water, poor hygiene practices or inadequate sanitation services, we must seriously invest in the treatment of industrial waste water and waste water in particular, which are poured untreated into nature. This, nevertheless, represents 70% of waste water. My final point relates to water and energy. We cannot replace water. Yet, as you know, the problem of shale gas management may lead to problems with groundwater pollution, hence the importance of the framework directive on groundwater, where they realised in Canada and the United States that it could cause pollution. Therefore, if we are fighting for water quality, we must do so at all levels. Michèle Rivasi,

Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, and the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Polish Presidency on their constructive work. From now on, consumers will be guaranteed better information. Ms Ries spoke about the sofas imported from Asian countries that contained fungicides and we all know the consequences these had for consumers, including extensive skin problems and severe erythema. Consumers should absolutely have been informed that items had been treated, but that was not the case until now. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is essential to reinforce the substitution of highly dangerous active substances by strengthening the exclusion criteria but also by limiting the derogations and introducing national guarantees for the adjustment of the conditions of use of product authorisations. We welcome, too, Commissioner, the specific and detailed provisions on nanomaterials, which you mentioned. This is a very important matter because we will be informed, there will be labelling, and substances such as nano-silver will have to be specifically authorised and assessed separately, which is justification for the validity of the methods used for the supporting assessment. The only damper on things – as has been mentioned – is that Parliament has lost its right of veto regarding the approval of active substances. It would seem that that was the price we had to pay for these improvements. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would actually like to inform my fellow Members, since we were there with Ms Herczog in Cadarache, that the ITER project is not insured. Since we are trying to keep the ITER budget under control, I have asked the question twice, and I have been told: ‘But it is not … (The President asked the speaker to ask her question)

 Mr President, I would like to raise two points that I feel are important. When we talk about generating electricity using this fusion, rather than fission reactor, we are talking about starting in 2100. Therefore, it is not really the most important priority at present. Secondly, people have been talking about keeping the budget under control, and I completely agree. The only problem is that in 2006, the budget was EUR 5 billion, whereas in 2011 it is EUR 15 billion: in other words, three times higher. On top of this, because of Fukushima the Japanese are now saying they will not be able to meet their commitments in two years’ time. This means that ITER will be delayed by another two years. A third factor, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, is that this is the first time that a facility like ITER, which entails certain risks, primarily of disruption – and I would invite you to read the studies that have been written on the subject – has not been insured. Why will the Indians, the Chinese and the Russians not insure it? It is because they do not want to increase the ITER budget any further. We are therefore setting ourselves on a collision course, and it would be better to stop now, rather than pour billions into a project that supposedly will be ready by 2100. For this reason, it is time we put an end to ITER. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I am grateful to Ms Ford for the work she has done, but I would like to point out that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution, one of the key points of which concerns the protection of sensitive natural areas, and specifically the Arctic. Indeed, granting exploration or exploitation licences means accepting liability, in the event of an accident of the kind we saw in the Gulf of Mexico and also in Scotland, for irreversible or very destructive damage in this unique part of the world. Furthermore, one is entitled to ask who is going to clean up this site in the event of an accident, since it is not an exclusive economic zone, and who defines its borders and hence the responsibilities relating to it: it is an area that belongs to everyone. I should like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to a number of points, the first of which is supervision. Supervision needs to be enhanced, but it would be good if it were carried out at European level and if the Maritime Safety Agency were responsible for it. Secondly, responsibilities need to be clearly defined. Amendment 76 establishes the full liability of oil companies, without any upper limit. At the same time, Amendment 47 defines civil liability, which covers not only environmental damage, but also social and economic damage, with guaranteed financial capacity to cover mandatory insurance. Including small oil companies in our deliberations is all well and good, but if they do not have any insurance, there is no point in granting them a licence. These points are therefore very important. Michèle Rivasi,

 Madam President, with what is happening with e.coli at the moment in Germany, France and other countries, I am a little surprised to note that it could be agued that, now we have solved the problem of animal-based meal, we should be able to give it to non-ruminants, including pigs, poultry and fish. To start with, I used to think that we do in fact have a lot of animal-based meal and that we could give it to all non-ruminants and herbivores, eliminate everything to give it to omnivores or carnivores. In fact, however, I see that, even if there were a whole set of constraints in place, we would not succeed. How are we going to monitor the existence of differentiated sectors? Let us take the example of a farm on which poultry and cattle co-exist. There will be animal-based meal for the poultry and other food for the cattle. The operator can easily make a mistake and give to the cattle what he gave to the poultry; there will be no guarantee, even if monitoring is carried out. I therefore asked a number of scientists, who told me that, as regards the problem of prion, which caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, there were still a huge number of scientific uncertainties. As far as consumers are concerned therefore – I know, Mr Dalli, that you are highly sensitive to the health of consumers – we must regain their confidence. You saw what happened with e.coli and you know the story about the cucumber. We learned that the cucumber was not to blame. I cannot see how, at the present time, farmers can be authorised to give animal-based meal to pigs and poultry. I believe that the solution is to say that our scientific knowledge is incomplete, draconian control and monitoring cannot be carried out, even if it is written into the texts, and that, as a precaution, it is better to place a ban on the feeding of animal-based meal to all animals.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire 
stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors. We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting. 80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors. Furthermore, we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risks. When we look at these stress tests as they relate to France, they become ‘relaxation tests’. Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France. This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue, but must be a European issue, the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I would nevertheless like to remind my fellow Members that the Fukushima accident is not over and that there are still risks of explosion relating to the molten core. I have a question to put to our Commissioner, Mr Oettinger. It is about the implementation of these stress tests. As our fellow Member has just said, how will you get a guarantee that all the criteria that you have mentioned to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are taken into account by each Member State that uses nuclear power stations? How will you force a Member State to allow independent experts to verify and monitor the power stations if it refuses? The reason I ask this is that, if they monitor themselves, I do not see how we will apply your stress tests. There absolutely must be an independent body monitoring the power stations in each Member State. How, furthermore, will we ensure that neighbouring countries – you spoke of Armenia, with Metsamor, and of other countries such as Belarus, and so on – accept such monitoring? Parliament will have to support you, Commissioner, but how will we do this? Finally, we have a real responsibility to phase out nuclear power, and this is where scenarios for achieving this must be proposed to Parliament. It is the only guarantee that there will be no further accidents. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, first of all something positive, Mr Barroso. I welcome the fact that you are going to adjust the European maximum levels in line with Japan’s levels, because at the time of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011, we realised that the levels proposed by the Commission were far too high. I welcome this therefore, and would like to see it incorporated into this regulation. My second point concerns imports of food products from Japan. There is a fundamental issue here. Are we going to be obliged to have contaminated food, although the contamination is below the maximum levels, in order to support the Japanese economy? I am sure you have children. I think to myself, am I going to give my children milk containing 500 Bq of iodine when there is an alternative milk with 0 Bq of iodine? I wonder if the Commission should perhaps consider blocking food and feed imported from Japan because it may be contaminated and instead help and support the Japanese people themselves, either financially or with uncontaminated foodstuffs. Lastly, I have an appeal to make to you Mr Barroso. I have been approached by Areva, who have travelled to Japan where their equipment had been blocked and is in storage at the airport. It is very important for you, if possible, to request the Japanese Government to release the equipment: the whole system including masks, robots and so on that has been blocked at the airport.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I fully endorse what Mrs Lepage has said and I would ask the following question: is it an opportunity or a predictable ecological disaster? We are nonetheless 10 years behind the United States in terms of exploitation. What can we see? We can see that the groundwater has been contaminated by the chemicals that have permeated this hydraulic fracturing. We can also see air pollution. We can now see that there are volatile organic compounds (VOC) and even ozone has appeared because of all the substances released into the air. We can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and, of course, the users of the phreatic nappes, because they can no longer drink the water they contain. Last week, the New York Times reported that, as well as polluting the groundwater with hydrocarbons and biocides, the contamination also emits radioactive elements. In France, as Mrs Lepage pointed out, eight licences were signed without any debate, without any consultation, without any impact assessment. And you talk of social acceptability? There is genuine rebellion. The latest demonstrations in the département of Ardèche were attended by more than 20 thousand people precisely because they care about their land. And you say, ‘It is an economic opportunity’. But whom does this gas benefit? Are we talking about cui bono
? Is it about choosing gas for the needs of industry to the detriment of the reserves of water in the phreatic nappes? The New York moratorium is a good illustration of the problem. We are therefore simply requesting that the licences be revoked. For explorations to take place while we have no guarantee of compliance with the Groundwater Framework Directive, the Air Quality Framework Directive or the Aarhus Convention is out of the question. We therefore await your responses and we will refuse, in Europe, in France and in the countries involved, to allow these non-conventional forms of gas to be exploited in the absence of these guarantees.

 Mr President, we all remember that H1N1 influenza was big news in 2009. The first cases were reported almost two years ago – on 25 March 2009 – and the WHO declared a phase 6 alert level on 11 June 2009. This maximum alert level issued by the WHO triggered a series of measures in Europe, including the activation of immunisation campaigns in several Member States which not only were very costly but were also overestimated in relation to the known severity of the virus, which, as the WHO stated at that time in May 2009, was moderate. As regards severity, up to the end of April 2010, this flu had caused around 2 900 deaths in Europe, in other words, a much lower mortality rate than that related to seasonal flu, which causes an estimated 40 000 - 220 000 deaths per year depending on the year. Meanwhile, the estimated costs were close to EUR 1.3 billion in the United Kingdom and over EUR 700 million in France according to the latest Court of Auditors report. The evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza shows that there was a disproportionate response in the European Union and the Member States. I and my colleagues, whom I would like to thank for their amendments, have therefore tried to produce a constructive report which aims to restore the confidence of European citizens in their health institutions. The report is structured around three major themes: cooperation, transparency and independence. In terms of cooperation, we are keen to stress the need for coherence, effectiveness, autonomy and flexibility. Future flu prevention plans, for example, must be revised in such a way as to guarantee greater coherence and effectiveness and must be made self-contained and flexible enough that they can be adapted in real time according to the latest available data. This kind of flexibility would have saved our public purses a good deal of unnecessary expense. At the same time, it is important to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the key players responsible for managing health risks. The definition of a pandemic itself must be revised so that it includes the concept of severity and does not just take account of geographical spread. Indeed, the WHO has informed us that it has this in hand. Group purchasing of vaccines is a possibility, provided that the manufacturers remain liable for the quality, safety and efficacy of their products. Under no circumstances must governments be made liable for side effects of vaccines that are supposed to be safe. As regards independence, the fast-track authorisation procedure has highlighted the problem of the lack of available scientific data. Research into vaccines and antiviral treatments must be conducted with complete independence from the pharmaceutical companies. In terms of transparency, total transparency is needed concerning the evaluation of drugs used for health emergencies, with full access to the clinical trials available. All declarations of interest on the part of the experts responsible for the evaluations must be made public. I have one regret: I would have preferred them to be checked by the agencies who recruit these experts, but this amendment was not adopted. Finally, I would like to highlight the cases of narcolepsy that have been reported in children in Finland and Sweden following vaccination with GSK’s H1N1 influenza vaccine. These cases need our attention. In the first instance, they clearly demonstrate that there are still grey areas, both in relation to the actual toxicity of the vaccines and adjuvants and in relation to possible risks as yet unknown to the manufacturers themselves. Finland has suspended the use of this vaccine until more information is available. This is not the position of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has decided instead to wait until more information is available before issuing any opinion on restricting the use of this vaccine. I would like to see the Commission adopt the same position as Finland. It is time that the precautionary principle benefited patients for once instead of always benefiting the companies.

Madam President, having participated in the observation mission to Haiti last September, I was able to realise the emergencies to be dealt with. Now we have to look beyond these emergencies to finally reach the development stage. We do not have to reconstruct but rather to construct a country whose foundations and governance have never been strong. One thing is clear, as my fellow Members have said: there are 20 million tonnes of rubble to clear and only 5%, a minute part, has been cleared in a year. At this rate, it will take more than six years to clear the ruins in Port-au-Prince. It is therefore a political project in itself and the Commission has to contribute to it. Another priority is governance and I am pleased that the European Union is making a major contribution to budgetary support for the country. We have to increase this financial effort because it is the only means of restoring competences to the Haitian country and people. Its current dependency on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is seen at the level of basic public services such as health and education. We must not, however, subcontract all public services to NGOs. Above all, we have to increase our support to organise elections quickly and complete these elections, which, I hope, should enable a corrupt political elite to be replaced. At present, an oligarchy of allegedly 20 families prevents any economic development because it controls trade but, at the same time, does nothing to develop the country’s production capacity. Finally, we have to give Haiti the resources to emerge from the dependency that was already undermining it even before the earthquake. Therefore, I call upon European institutions to establish consistent priorities and to give massive support to setting up public services with strong commitment from the future Haitian Government.

Mr President, on the subject of this text that we voted for, I would like to draw your attention – and I must congratulate Mrs McAvan for the quality of her work – to an omission regarding guinea pig populations. In fact, there is one point that has been neglected, which, on account of the agreement concluded in first reading, could not be the subject of an oral amendment: it is a question of people used as guinea pigs for clinical tests of a medicine or vaccine conducted before authorisation in order to check its harmlessness or its risk-benefit balance. These people may include men, women, children or elderly people; in this text, we are concerned with the follow-up of the possible side-effects of drugs for human use. In fact, it must be pointed out that these people who participate in clinical tests are kept in ignorance as regards the substance ingested or injected and that the effects are only likely to be triggered ten, twenty or thirty years later. These guinea pigs are the forgotten people of pharmacovigilance and it is important to remember this and mention it. Michèle Rivasi,

I should like to say that it is very important in this sector to provide patients with better protection and better information, but also to fight against the stranglehold exerted by the pharmaceutical industry, which wanted to collect reports of side effects and to analyse and interpret the results. At the level of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – and, moreover, at the level of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – we therefore succeeding in ensuring that, when it comes to the collection of reports, doctors and patients will be the ones able to report side effects for transmission to the national authorities. As far as analysis and interpretation are concerned, the Member States are responsible for detecting and monitoring the adverse reactions of medicinal products. It transpired, in connection with the outbreak of H1N1 influenza, that it was the Swedish national authorities which referred to narcolepsy even though, until now, the H1N1 vaccine had not been associated with such side effects. This is very important. On the other hand, I am very disappointed that we have not achieved financial independence from the national authorities. Finally, as far as controls are concerned, there has been real progress in relation to this Pharmacovigilance Committee, which is separate from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and I hope that there will also be more information available for patients, either on package leaflets or in terms of ultra-vigilance.

Mr President, I would like to come back to the environmental impact of medicinal products. Since 1965, Europe has established criteria for obtaining marketing authorisations. There are three criteria, namely efficacy, safety and the pharmaceutical quality of the medicinal product, but there is nothing about the environmental impact of medicinal products. As you know, the oestrogen found in river waters is changing the sex of fish. As you also know, there are high levels of residues of medicinal products in purification plants and in waste water from hospitals. There has been a fair amount of discussion on this matter; a debate has been held and, in the Pharmacovigilance Directive, it has finally been taken into account in the form of a recital calling on the Commission to publish a report, on the basis of data provided by the European Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Member States, on the scale of the problem and an assessment of whether or not it would be appropriate or useful to amend EU legislation on medicinal products or in other areas. What I want of the Commission is a proper report based on these data, because this indirectly affects human health in that, in numerous cases, it is the consumption of water that caused the side effects identified. Michèle Rivasi,

Mr President, I consider that progress has been made in this text, including on two fundamental aspects: the need for labelling if nanoparticles are present in a product and, more importantly, the fact that each of these nanosubstances will also be subject to separate evaluation, which is not currently the case. Progress has also been made in terms of the possibility of excluding endocrine disrupters from substances used, with specific and properly applicable exclusion criteria. But – there is a but – we disagree on the actual resources for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), because that agency’s mission should be to evaluate and authorise biocidal products. However, we have just extended the ECHA’s mission; we agree with that, but extending it means giving the ECHA the resources to really do its job. We cannot ask the ECHA to do a lot more work, to reduce substance evaluation times, while, at the same time, reducing its resources. If we do so, we risk coming up against simplified assessments, which may well be fast, but which will be superficial and therefore inadequate. That is why I call on you, Mrs Klaß, to reconsider your budgetary proposal concerning the ECHA missions in this dossier. As it stands, I must say that your proposal is not a serious one, and this will affect the standard of work of that European institution, which is essential to the safety of European citizens and consumers. This is an important issue. You cannot demand more if the resources are not available, or else the ECHA will just be an administrative agency which responds to the industrial lobby.

 Mr President, I would like to make the connection between the scanner, health and terrorism. What does the Interagency Committee on Radioprotection, which brings together the European Commission, the IAEA – the International Atomic Energy Agency – and the Nuclear Energy Agency say? It says that pregnant women and children must not be subjected to body scans, even if the doses are extremely small. Indeed, we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations. My question therefore concerns justification of the risks. Given the existence of alternative technologies that enable the same goals to be achieved, these scanners really do need to be justified in relation to the given objective, and we need to know … (The President cut off the speaker) Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, for my part, would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine. Currently, the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation, and I would like to share a number of concerns with you. Firstly, what is the relationship between the risks and benefits? At the moment, the benefits are few, since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths – nowhere near as many as seasonal flu, in any case. With regard to the risks, on the other hand, we have enough time to consider this aspect, and I would like, in particular, to address the problem of adjuvants. I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd: in the United States, the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited, but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene. The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype. I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, the current situation of migrants is a legacy of the past. With this motion for a resolution, we wish to galvanise the new Libyan Government to action with regard to migrants’ rights and to make clear that we would like very much and are prepared to assist it in establishing new policies towards migrants and asylum seekers, as this is a crucial issue. Non-governmental organisations working in Libya have reported numerous human rights violations, including sexual violence towards children and women.  Finally, in order to ensure better protection of migrants’ rights, it is vital that Libya, which has successfully started out on the path to democracy, should draw a line under the past and the legacy of the dictatorship by ratifying international conventions, including, of course, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the political message of this report, which calls on the European Union to make signature of the EU-Kazakhstan enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement dependent on progress on democracy, respect for human rights and freedom of the press. I condemn the decision of the Appellate Court in Aktau to sentence the opposition politician Vladimir Kozlov to seven and a half years in prison. His trial, monitored closely by the international community, has been described as staged, as a ‘Soviet-style’ trial. There is absolutely no concrete evidence against Mr Kozlov. He is accused of having spoken out against his country when abroad, in particular in his speeches in the European Parliament. It is unacceptable for opponents and defenders of human rights invited to Parliament to be at risk once they return home and even imprisoned. That calls into question the very credibility of this House. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, if this new generation is not given pens, they will be given guns by terrorists. Those are the words of Malala, who, at the age of 14, understands fully that educating children and combating obscurantism go hand in hand. Besides the case of this young Pakistani girl, who has become a symbol, I would remind you that young girls in Afghanistan have to deal with this unacceptable situation every day. The extensive violence to which they are subjected no longer makes the headlines, as it did 10 years ago, when we wanted to justify our military action in Afghanistan on the grounds of emancipating Afghan women. I must therefore repeat it again: we cannot forget them. That is the message that the Afghan parliamentarians wanted to get across when they visited the European Parliament a few weeks ago. They fear that in 2014, after the ISAF forces withdraw, the rights they have obtained over this last decade will quite simply be exchanged for a return to calm during the negotiations between the Afghan Government and the Taliban. For that reason, we must continue to condemn tirelessly these archaic practices. Above all, however, the European Union must provide financial support for the local women’s associations who are fighting to keep the schools open. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask you if you are aware of the reports of the European Union’s ambassadors and delegations in Jerusalem, which have stated clearly in recent years that we cannot guarantee the traceability of products from Israel and thus identify and distinguish products from the settlements. I would like to know if you are aware of these reports because I am astonished that you say that products from the settlements are not involved. In addition, have you also heard that in many countries, and mine in particular, consumers regularly spot products from the settlements on our markets? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not a simple technical agreement. It means stronger EU-Israeli relations and free access to Europe’s single market even though the EU decided in 2009 to suspend the upgrading of its economic relations with Israel. Supporting this agreement means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal settlement of the Palestinian territories; it means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza. The reports by our ambassadors in Jerusalem recommend that we adopt binding measures to put an end to the settlements. The European Union has stated that the Israeli settlement policy is an obstacle to peace so, for the sake of consistency, if we adopt the ACAA we should refuse the Nobel Peace Prize.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that we should condemn such a blatant violation of human rights and such an outburst of violence, which serve as a reminder for South Africa of the darkest days of its history. I want to highlight the fact that today, South Africa, which is often lauded as a model of democracy, has an opportunity to show us that it is capable of applying the fundamental principles of this democracy, namely, impartial justice and respect for the rule of law. I am therefore pleased that a committee of inquiry has been established in order to shed light on the tragic events of 16 August, but it seems to me that it is essential that we also condemn the use of common purpose law, a throwback to apartheid, which has only served to crystallise the anger in the country a little more. In South Africa, as in many African states, the wealth of mineral resources is in stark contrast to the rising poverty of part of the population. This part of the population, which is crying out for change, with the fall of the apartheid regime, is, on the contrary, seeing growing social inequalities and a new economic apartheid take root. The sharing of natural resources remains a key issue on the African continent, and multinationals must shoulder their responsibilities in the current conflicts. That is why Europe must promote another kind of economic and human development in these regions, by stopping imports of mining products extracted without social or environmental guarantees. In conclusion, I would add that this situation should give us cause to reflect, because in South Africa, as in other countries around the world, democracy does not simply mean free elections, but also more social justice.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on this excellent result. The compromise reached between the institutions paves the way for real progress on uniting the European continent to help particularly vulnerable people who are the victims of crime. This directive will reinforce a series of measures implemented at European level to promote the free movement and the defence of victims of crime, such as the European protection order. We can welcome the result of this trialogue, for example, the definition of gender-based violence, even though it only appears in the recitals rather than the articles. We must also welcome the fact that all victims have been included, regardless of their status, particularly their residence status. From now on, the most vulnerable people will have the right, in European territory, to protection and consideration of their needs. The text recognises the impact of crime, not only on the victim, but also on close family members, including children. Despite these advances, I would like to underline the need to consider violence against women as a social phenomenon as such and, like a number of my colleagues, I call on the Commission to prepare a specific directive on this issue.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution on EU policy on the occupied Palestinian territories. This text provides a comprehensive account of reality on the ground and openly denounces the rampant expansion of Israeli settlements, the extremism of the settlers, the expulsions and the demolition of Palestinian houses. I welcome the fact that Parliament unequivocally calls on the Israeli authorities to end the expansion of the settlements and once again reiterates the official position of the European Union, which is that Europe will not recognise any unilateral change to the borders of the future state of Palestine. I regret, however, that this resolution lacks ambition. Parliament does not openly recognise that the existing control mechanism – the 2005 technical agreement concluded by the Commission with the Israeli authorities – has never been effectively implemented and that products from the Israeli settlements continue to be imported into the European market labelled ‘made in Israel’. Instead of calling on the Commission to create a new legally binding control mechanism, Parliament is content to request that the Union’s existing legislation be implemented.

 Mr President, the issue of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Africa keeps appearing on the parliamentary agenda, and with good reason. Two thirds of African countries have repressive laws in this area and, as has already been mentioned, South Africa is currently regressing on this issue. Today, I would like to talk to you about the documentary made in Uganda by two women on the situation of LGBT people. During filming, in 2010, David Kato, an iconic figure in the fight of LGBTs in Africa, was assassinated. This documentary then changed dimension, and the message of tolerance and hope it bears must be disseminated as widely as possible. I would therefore like to invite you to see this film, which is entitled Call me Kuchu
, and to encourage its distribution in all Member States to let them know of the fate of the Kuchus and to not let silence make them disappear. I will leave you with this phrase spoken by David Kato: ‘They keep saying we do not exist, but we definitely do’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that in several Member States, including France, it is consumer associations and human rights organisations which carry out controls on the origin of products labelled ‘Made in Israel’, and these groups regularly denounce the presence on our markets of products originating in illegal settlements. It is not a rare occurrence. In a spirit of ethical consumption, civil society therefore tries to ensure the traceability of products imported from Israel, as the European Union has shown that it is incapable of implementing the 2005 technical agreement in accordance with international law. You will understand that I am very sceptical and dubious that you will give us guarantees, as you should, on legally binding provisions ensuring that no more products from the settlements are entering the European market. I should like to point out that, with regard to medicines, the children of Gaza not only do not have medicines, but do not even have access to drinking water or enough food to sustain themselves. I think it is important to keep in mind the global context, which, from a humanitarian and human rights point of view, is a dramatic context, and we cannot content ourselves with simply talking about trade without talking about that.

Mr President, the Sahel region, which has already been severely affected by climate change and weakened by the presence of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), has been destabilised by the war in Libya and the return of heavily armed mercenaries. The risk of a merger between certain Islamist groups and the Tuareg rebellion are concerning but should force us to understand the reasons behind them. The financial austerity policies that have been imposed in Africa for 30 years by international institutions, external interference and the exploitation of natural resources have led to impoverishment. In Mali, the population has barely seen the positive social and economic effects that should have come about through gold production. Mali is the third largest producer of gold in Africa. The Malian mining code does not provide for any restriction on mining companies in terms of environmental and social responsibility. This weakness in the legislation makes Mali extremely attractive. Now uranium is being coveted by a French company, which is drilling and working with absolutely no regard for the population and the environment, causing many inhabitants of the Faléa commune to protest. In Niger, France has been exploiting uranium for 40 years and the situation of the local population has not improved at all. On 25 April, the staff of the Imouraren site initiated a strike to protest against disastrous working conditions, claiming that they were working 12 hours a day. In Niger, 60% of exports rely on uranium, and the country provides close to 40% of the stock for Areva, which plans to develop what will be the second largest uranium mine in the world. Niger is classed as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of the human development index. The local population is mainly Tuareg and has long suffered the almost irreversible health consequences of this irresponsible exploitation: air pollution and contamination of the region’s scarce water resources. In conclusion, Europe must therefore promote further economic and human development in this region. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, let me tell you about my personal experience in this regard. In the context of decentralised cooperation, I had the opportunity to work with associations in Africa and came face to face with the reality of female genital mutilation, about which Ms De Keyser has just spoken. Our resolution stresses the importance of relying on local authorities and NGOs. Taking into account the realities on the ground is essential in the fight against these practices. For example, in any programme to combat female genital mutilation, it must be borne in mind that, for the women who practise it, it is a professional activity. It is sometimes their only source of income, and I know from experience that many of these women are more than willing to abandon the practice if they are offered reintegration into the labour market. I particularly wanted to share this testimony with you, as it is my personal experience. I would also like to stress the exemplary value of the delegations we send to third countries, which must ensure equal representation, as this is the best way of advancing the cause of gender equality.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, if the NATO summit officially records a decision to pull out of Afghanistan, it might as well be officially recording the defeat of the West. If we were to compare the statements made by NATO and the Council with information coming from Afghan civil society and the NGOs, you would think that they were talking about two different countries: the resurgence of the Taliban, who are champing at the bit to stamp their authority on the entire country and take their revenge on those who collaborated with the West. I refer of course to women, and I remember how, in 2001, the plight of Afghan women was exploited to justify a military intervention that the population had not asked for. After the bombings and destruction, they were promised reconstruction, peace and democracy. They have failed. According to the Minister, Mr Eftekhari, 6 million children are suffering from extreme poverty, abuse and violence. Under pressure from the Taliban, schools have been burned, teachers threatened and killed. Nearly 550 girls’ schools have closed their doors in 11 provinces. Young people flee the country to come to the West, the land of promise. There is no point dwelling on the reception or rather the lack of reception waiting for them in Europe: we should be ashamed of ourselves. In addition, Pakistan and Iran have decided to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from their countries. Given the EU’s commitment to the Afghan people, are we prepared, Baroness Ashton, at Council level and in the European External Action Service (EEAS), to adopt a plan to help and take in these refugees? Will we welcome and support the threatened teachers, the women’s rights activists, all those who have put their trust in us and who have to choose … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues and to express my gratitude for the very interesting contributions I have received for this report which, I hope, will be the start of a growing awareness on the part of our institutions. In an ideal Parliament, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality would not exist and issues relating to gender and discrimination against women would be spontaneously integrated into all the matters we deal with here, because this is a cross-cutting issue. However, it is necessary to continue to drive the point home without any let-up because we Members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have a responsibility to remove women from the blind spot of European policies. This is particularly true of environmental issues. I would even go so far as to say that we will show in our report that women are not the green plants of ecology. The figures are staggering. Women are 14 times more likely to die during cyclones, floods and earthquakes. In the tsunami that affected Asia in 2004, for example, and also in the heat wave that hit Europe in 2003, 70% of the victims were women. Why? Women do not have the same resources – economic, social or political – to adapt or even to flee. On the other hand, in Honduras, thanks to a warning and disaster management system which included women from the outset, La Masica was the only town not to record a single death during and after hurricane Mitch. Climate change remains an absolute priority but, in a context of economic crisis, ecology is not the only thing to regress. Women’s rights, too, are eroded and it is by linking the two that we are proposing a coherent political vision and effective solutions. In the past, whenever there was a crisis, whenever there was revolution, we were told that women’s rights would come afterwards. This line of reasoning is out of date and unsound. The challenges of climate change and that of justice and equality for women are intrinsically linked. Women are not only victims to be protected. Women also have knowledge and proposals to make: not because they are, of course, different, but because we live in a society where roles are often gendered. Being a woman or a man has an impact on our daily lives, from the management of resources and access to education to the choice of occupation. These differences in experience are reflected in the solutions and ideas proposed. In the report, we have identified four types of measures. Firstly, measures of representation. We are calling for women’s representation of at least 40% in political, financial and technical bodies. The voice of women and their organisations must be heard and supported. Secondly, measures concerning protection and training, establishing a virtuous cycle for women, from victims to agents of change. Thirdly, measures of education, not only to open up the future green economy and encourage women to pursue scientific and technical careers, but also to support the necessary changes in lifestyle patterns. Finally, as regards research, we need data disaggregated by sex to be collected to improve our understanding of the subject and our policy proposals. To summarise the spirit of this report, we maintain that policies to combat climate change can be enriched through the integration of gender issues and that combating discrimination generates solutions that are more effective for the environment. It is a win-win line of reasoning. As we approach the Rio+20 Summit, it is clear that there are no simple solutions to a challenge as complex and pressing as climate change. It is by broadening our way of thinking that we will find the resources to make a significant change for the better. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I knew, after meeting Commissioner Hedegaard at a hearing organised by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, that we could count on her and on the Commission. I also know that we can count on the Danish Presidency having, in fact, heard a number of proposals. I would like to thank all my colleagues, men and women, who have spoken here today, because what they have said has simply reflected the work we have done collectively, which is very enriching for us all. I think this debate was necessary, and that we must, of course, continue to raise awareness. Each one of us here has contributed to this report and I am very satisfied. I know that we can also rely on the Institute for Gender Equality, which we created in Vilnius in 2011. I should nonetheless like to say something. I would like to pay tribute to all the women and women’s associations worldwide who have long understood that something had to be done about preserving resources and about climate issues. In some countries, women have known this for a long time. In this regard, I will mention India, where, within the Chipko movement, women attached themselves to trees to save them; Rwanda too, where women have preserved 600 kinds of beans. I would also like to pay homage to Wangari Maathai, whom no one here will have forgotten, who left us recently and who, with her Green Belt movement, preserved millions of trees. Women in developing countries recognised the need to take action a long time ago and we know we can count on them. A final point, which has been raised several times, is the issue of quotas. My political group and I, personally, are very much in favour of this tool. It is only a tool, per se
, but it has enabled us to become the only political group with equal representation in this Parliament. I believe it is the only way, unfortunately, to move things forward. If we do not use this tool of allocating quotas, we will not succeed in advancing gender equality. It is simply a tool. Finally, if you will permit me, I shall quote Einstein, who said, ‘Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, it is true that Kazakhstan is the most open country in Central Asia, economically speaking. European investments are welcome there and companies such as Total, Eni, Areva and Alstom have operations there with major interests. It is also true that Europe is hoping to use this country as a route to transport its troops and military equipment out of Afghanistan. In view of its interests, Europe is remaining discreet and pragmatic towards the Kazakh authorities. However, are we not being too pragmatic at the risk of repeating the same mistakes we made with the Arab world? Moreover, that is what civil society in Kazakhstan, and in the former Soviet Union in general, is convinced that we are doing. We must therefore be attentive to what is actually happening in Kazakhstan. By freeing Ms Sokolova, the lawyer for the trade unionists, and Mr Zhovtis, the human rights defender, the Kazakh authorities are showing proof of goodwill. However, growing and continuing repression of the political opposition, the trade unionists and the independent media persists. Forty-three strikers in Zhanaozen are being threatened with long prison sentences, as are nine members of the opposition, Mr Kozlov, Mr Viniavski and Ms Amirova. We have seen unbelievable censorship of the electronic media to silence all alternative sources of information. Following the orders of the presidential Security Council, 125 websites, judged to be dangerous, have already been blocked, with 168 others on a blacklist. A series of recently promulgated laws tracks this regression in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan: laws on audio-visual material, the Internet and information and a law on religious communities. Although the Kazakh authorities are telling us that they learned their lesson from the tragedy in Zhanaozen, they have just promulgated a law on national security which severely limits freedom of expression and the freedom to change the labour code, which restricts the rights of workers. Are we going to, once again, content ourselves with verbal promises from the Kazakh authorities and continue with business as usual or are we going to openly say to our Kazakh partners that the repression of dissident voices cannot ensure long-term stability? The European Union will, in any case, have to commit to daily monitoring of the upcoming trials of the various strikers and opponents and ensure that the legislative reforms guarantee fundamental freedoms. All of these developments should determine our position on upgrading the partnership with Kazakhstan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, in addressing the issue of quotas, Ms Reding has brought up an old debate on the legitimacy of binding legislative measures. As far as I am concerned, I am fully in favour of proactive, binding measures on the issue that we are considering today, since it is plain that matters are not progressing at all. At university, it has been said that at the top colleges there are brilliant female students who have far higher qualifications than their male colleagues. However, as soon as students enter the world of work, it is clear that difficulties arise and that women are not managing to break through the notorious glass ceiling. At European Union level, we cannot continue to do without the skills of half of the population, once referred to as ‘half of heaven’. What I would like to say to you is that I belong to a political organisation which enshrined equality in its own rules in 1984 in France, and that we have obtained brilliant results. We have had the first female regional president in France. We have had female candidates for the presidential elections. Currently in this Parliament, I am one of eight women elected out of a total of 15 MEPs, making more women than men. I therefore believe that when a decision is taken to move things forward, all that is needed is to take measures such as these in order to achieve equality. I am 100% in favour of these binding measures because parity seems vital to me. This is, quite simply, a question of justice. It is not a question of quotas. I believe that we must talk of parity, and not of quotas. Quotas are 30-40%; they are not justice. Justice is 50:50. I believe that we absolutely must achieve that. Madam President, I would like to propose to you that we should be setting an example, particularly in respect of the Member States; why should we not introduce parity in Parliament’s executive Bureau, from the next term? I think it would be important to start with that step. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to talk to you about Kazakhstan. Did you know that the massive oil workers’ strike which began last May in the province of Mangistau has resulted in brutal repression and the arrest of trade unionists and their lawyer? On 16 December, a peaceful protest at Zhanaozen ended in bloodshed. There were many injuries, at least 15 deaths, as well as arrests and incidents of mistreatment, torture and rape. The legislative elections of 15 January were deemed neither free nor democratic by observers. Finally, human rights defenders and militants from opposition parties recently invited to give their views before the Members of our Parliament were arrested upon their return and are facing long prison sentences. Faced with this authoritarian and repressive abuse, the European Union’s silence is unacceptable. How do you intend to react, Baroness Ashton, to what I have just told you? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Baroness Ashton stated that human rights should henceforth run as a silver thread throughout all of our external actions. The European Union is one of the main trading partners of Uzbekistan and a major importer of cotton. In view of conditions during the cotton harvest, Parliament is duty-bound to shoulder its moral responsibility and refuse to consent to this agreement as long as Uzbekistan continues to deny access to the independent mission of the International Labour Organisation, and until that mission confirms that reforms have been implemented, bringing an end to forced child labour. For the first time ever, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament can use its new powers and refuse to ratify a trade agreement in the name of human rights. Our action is therefore consistent with the values we defend, and conforms to what is being demanded by NGOs, trade unions and textile retailers’ groups, who are calling for ethical production. The ball is now in the Commission’s court, and it should withdraw the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for Uzbekistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, a great deal has been achieved in the four years since we implemented the EU strategy for Central Asia. The Union has established a continuous political dialogue and regular dialogues on human rights. Initiatives and important programmes have been activated in support of the EU’s seven priority areas. However, in light of the Arab Spring, and in the context of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan, which is already under way, bearing in mind the tragic events of southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, the limitations of our strategy are much more visible today, and this requires a major re-assessment on our part. The strategy is due to be reviewed by the European External Action Service in 2012, and we therefore considered that some key recommendations should be set out in the report, based on the following observation: the EU is unable to reconcile its values and interests in effective programmes that are adapted to the realities and developments in the region. Europe lacks visibility there. Its presence is still in its early stages. The funding devoted to the strategy is modest and would even appear to be under threat. We do not give sufficient open support to civil society, independent media or human rights defenders. Sometimes, in fact, it is pro-government foundations that benefit from European financial support, much to the frustration of genuine NGOs. In the light of this situation, the European Parliament is convinced that it should develop a new EU approach based on human security and regional cooperation. All our actions, projects and initiatives should follow the guiding principle of promoting human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Europe and its Western partners, who are bogged down in the quagmire of Afghanistan and concerned about their military bases in the region, have, for too long, given priority to the stability of the regimes in place rather than human rights. However, stability based on repression does not last long, and the Arab Spring is proof of that. We should be careful not to make the same mistakes twice, and we must be capable of better responding to the political vacuum that a similar change could trigger in Central Asia, in a context of ethnic and regional conflicts. In Kazakhstan, trade unions in the oil sector have been on strike for more than six months despite merciless repression. Early legislative elections will be held on 15 January 2012, against a backdrop of unprecedented social tension and the banning of political parties. Will we have the courage and honesty to tell the Kazhak Government that the EU will draw the appropriate conclusions from these events during negotiations on future partnership and cooperation agreements? We are alarmed by the Human Rights Watch report published yesterday on the indescribably cruel torture that is carried out in Uzbekistan prisons. In Tashkent, human rights defenders have just been arrested. We were happy to hear Baroness Ashton, in Parliament, insisting that human rights should henceforth form the backbone of all of our external action. We therefore recommend carrying out a review of our strategy for Central Asia. I am especially proud of the fact that Parliament has put conditionality and the principles of differentiation and ‘more for more’ at the heart of its new approach, while recommending that we should enhance our support for civil society and independent media organisations. The EU cannot be honest in one part of the world while failing to respond to violations of its values in another. Lastly, we should consider regional cooperation. The challenges these countries are facing call for a concerted approach: ethnic conflicts, water resource management, security problems, circulation of arms and trafficking of drugs and people. These threats directly affect the security and stability of Central Asia, and also of Europe. We therefore recommend that the EU should play the role of mediator and facilitator. In order to promote dialogue between these countries, we recommend establishing an ad hoc
 parliamentary forum, which the EU, through the European Parliament delegation, could propose to the parliaments of the five Central Asian countries. MEPs would thus be able to share their experience and expertise while meeting with their counterparts. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuation of the Israeli colonisation in Palestine has brought the peace talks to a standstill and has led the Palestinians to demand their accession to the UN, now that they have put in place credible political and economic institutions. Europe is dithering at a time when it should be adopting an independent position and asserting itself as a player on the international stage. According to a very recent poll, the majority of French, German and British citizens think that the Palestinians have the right to a State that should be recognised by the UN immediately. The fact is, we represent the citizens of Europe. The democratic awakening of the Arab world creates a new context which is likely to relaunch the peace process. The aspirations of young people are the same in Tunis, Cairo, Ramallah and Gaza. If we abandon the Palestinians, despair could lead to a new intifada, for which we would be responsible. It is in fact a historic opportunity that is being presented to the European Union. It should include the recognition of this Palestinian state in its policy of support for the Arab Spring, instead of exerting pressure on the Palestinian Authority to force it to abandon its claim to fully fledged statehood at the UN, and instead of working on the Israeli Government so that it finally agrees to respect international law.

 Mr President, I raised my blue card earlier on, but you did not see it. For I could have already asked Mr Provera the question I am asking Ms Ries, since they both used the same term –‘unilateral’ – several times. I would like them to explain what they mean by that and to also tell me how they define the building by Israel of hundreds of kilometres of wall and hundreds upon hundreds of houses in the settlements. I would like them to tell me how they can talk about unilateralism when we know that this initiative of recognising a Palestinian state is supported by 130 or 140 countries. I confess that I need the word to be defined for me. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance once again deplores the conditions under which Mr Rajoelina came to power in Madagascar. The political situation of that country, which is very unstable, is extremely worrying. There have been numerous human rights violations: violence against demonstrators, illegal arrests, arbitrary detentions, as well as abuses against journalists and political opponents. The security forces enjoy total impunity. Leaders of opposition political movements have been imprisoned. We are demanding their release. In addition, the uncontrolled management of the country’s natural resources threatens prospects for development for future generations and paves the way for an ecological disaster. We condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pillaging of precious wood, particularly rosewood. The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and foremost, the European Union. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, these assassinations are, of course, intolerable, but what is more intolerable is the climate of impunity that exists, despite the increase in attacks. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors. Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws. The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally. According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system. The European Union must therefore use all the necessary instruments at its disposal to strengthen judicial cooperation with Pakistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have observed a strange tendency within the European Union: despite statements criticising Israel’s human rights violations, the Member States and the Commission are working tirelessly to strengthen political and economic relations with Israel, with no conditions attached. On 22 February, the Union actually upgraded its association agreement with Israel, promising to step up cooperation in several apparently technical agreements in various areas: competition, access to public contracts, Israel’s integration into the European Research Area and into European agencies such as Europol, the European Space Agency and so on. On 31 January, the Commission authorised the transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to Israel, a country suspected of having used EU citizens’ passports to carry out an extrajudicial killing in Dubai last year. Israel, which already participates in more than 800 projects with European universities and businesses, will receive more than EUR 500 million in subsidies in 2013. Among the beneficiaries will be the arms manufacturers Elbit and Israel Aerospace Industries, which manufacture the drones and aircraft used against the people of Gaza. At the Association Council, the European Union welcomed the new measures announced by Mr Netanyahu for Gaza and the West Bank. Baroness Ashton, please could you indicate what this facilitation measure consists of when hundreds of lorry drivers are protesting in Gaza as we speak to denounce the closure of the Karni crossing? Also, how does Mr Netanyahu propose to stop the rapid colonisation of Jerusalem and the West Bank? I would be grateful, Baroness Ashton, if you could send a message of encouragement and a true message of hope to all those women who took to the streets in Palestine yesterday and who are expecting a great deal of the European Union. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the massacres inflicted on the Coptic Christians in Alexandria provoked international outrage. The Eastern Christians’ situation as a whole is worrying: in Iraq, in Lebanon and even in Palestine, where Christians are leaving what they see as their Holy Land, worn down by the humiliation they have suffered under Israeli occupation. I am glad that our resolution on freedom of religion gives the subject a broad interpretation and recalls the fundamental rights: the right to believe and not to believe; the right to choose a religion without being discriminated against. Whilst our text quite rightly mentions the recent attacks and killings that have gone on in the world, we must also admit that in some European countries, respect for this freedom of religion is under threat. We often witness acts of intolerance: the profaning of Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic talk. Actions such as Switzerland’s vote to ban the construction of minarets and the rise of extremist parties who express intolerant views against certain communities are all signs that we must make the fight to uphold secular principles a priority in Europe. Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and ethnic and religious minorities are all facing a worrying increase in violations of their universal fundamental rights. Europe ought to set an example on tolerance and intercommunity dialogue. Eastern Christians are increasingly suspected of representing the interests and causes of the West, while Muslims in Europe are associated with radical Islam and terrorism. Let me read you if I may two lines of a poem by Louis Aragon: ‘Celui qui croyait au ciel, celui qui n'y croyait pas, et leur sang rouge ruisselle, même couleur, même éclat
’ (‘The one who believed in God and the one who did not, their blood runs equally red and equally bright’). Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Mrs Ashton, may I take this opportunity to thank Mr Arlacchi for the constructive atmosphere in which we have worked. This report offers a very honest, very fair analysis of the shortcomings in the international intervention in Afghanistan since 2001. We approve its key message: there will be no military solution. The war is having a huge cost. The war is costing human lives both amongst the soldiers and the population and it only serves to strengthen the Taliban. The only solution is a political one. What the Afghans are waiting for is real investment in their country’s development, in support for good governance, in the creation of a judicial system. The problem of fundamental rights, most importantly women’s rights, remains intact. The very recent report of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan demonstrates the inability of the Afghan Government to fully safeguard the rights of women and girls. I quote: ‘As long as women and girls are subject to practices that harm them, degrade them and deprive them of their rights, little significant or lasting progress can be made in Afghanistan’. In order to safeguard the rights of Afghan women, not only do we need written legal and constitutional guarantees, but more importantly their rapid and appropriate application. The National Assembly has little influence in the country, the bulk of the power being concentrated in the hands of President Karzai. If it is not too late, unfailing support, to strengthen democracy and the state of law, must come from the European Union to the various institutions and, in particular, to the parliament that has just been elected. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, on 8 November, the Moroccan authorities used violence in dismantling the camp set up near Laâyoune, in Western Sahara, resulting in deaths and numerous injuries. I am absolutely outraged that a Member State, in this instance France, should object to the request for a UN fact-finding mission looking into these events. Uganda’s proposal at the UN Security Council meeting on 16 November was however both legitimate and desirable. It is all very well for France to hide behind the lack of decision on the part of the Security Council when it has abused its weight of veto power to prevent any light being shed on these incidents. Would the truth be so hard to face? Europe, which likes to think itself exemplary in protecting human rights, must demand an independent and transparent fact-finding mission, under the aegis of the United Nations, and an extended mandate for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). More generally, we are counting on Baroness Ashton for a fair and lasting solution to be brought to this unacceptable situation for the Sahrawi people. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the Commission wrote in 2005 that, ‘individual expulsion decisions [taken by Member States’ competent authorities] have to comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention, the 1967 Protocol and international treaties. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The fact is, serious human rights violations do take place in Pakistan: the death penalty, torture, death while in custody, forced disappearances, honour crimes. As has already been said, there are several international agreements that it has not signed. How can we be sure that the rights of readmitted individuals and their safety will be protected? There are no guarantees for ethnic or religious minorities or for women. There is no mention of the consequences of the agreement for Afghan refugees, nor are there any plans for the implementation of the agreement to be monitored by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights. In the name of human rights and human dignity, Parliament must reject this agreement. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some people are saying that today’s debate is no longer topical. However, while pressure groups have been attacking European funding for Israeli NGOs since 2005, the working conditions of civil society in Israel continue to deteriorate. Since the publication of the Goldstone report, many representatives of organisations have been defamed, intimidated and arrested. Fourteen draft bills are currently under discussion. They all have the aim of restricting independence and freedom of association. I would remind you that Israeli defenders of human rights are no longer allowed to enter the occupied territories without a permit from the army. Israeli democrats and pacifists, who have been able to benefit from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, are concerned, because even in an amended form, this draft bill specifically targets the financing of international organisations while private funding is not affected. We will no longer accept that those people who have the courage to denounce the daily humiliations suffered by Palestinians, the expulsion of families, demolition of houses, land confiscation and water deprivation, should be reduced to silence. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I would simply like to ask Mrs Ries, since she does not think there has been any impact on the Knesset or on the Israeli authorities, to explain the communiqué from the Israeli Embassy which we were just talking about and to explain certain e-mails we have received over the past few days. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to start by paying tribute to the coalition of ecologists that we welcomed some months ago in Brussels, an association of Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians. It drew up some excellent reports on the situation in the region, on the state of the Jordan River, and on the risk of its disappearance. The European Union, which allocates substantial funds to development projects in the Middle East, must play more of a role in drafting and implementing a rescue plan for the river involving all parties in the region. The countries bordering the river, such as Syria, Jordan and Israel, divert the greatest part of it, while the Palestinians – as someone just said – receive only around 5% of the resource. In the Jordan Valley, the Israeli settlers consume six times more water than the Palestinians, particularly through the polluting intensive agriculture intended for the export of agricultural products to Europe. The extension of these settlements with their lush vegetation must stop, as must the destruction of Bedouin camps and their water tanks, which happened again this summer, some weeks ago. It is madness! The preservation and fair distribution of water in the region must be a priority for us. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
).

Madam President, the case of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, which obviously brings us together this evening, and which has mobilised many citizens in Europe, should also provide us with an opportunity to discuss the situation of a number of women. I am thinking in particular of Zahra Bahrami, who is in the same situation. She is in danger of being executed following a trial that took place in similar conditions, that is to say, that she was subjected to pressure, isolation – total isolation – for several months, violence and torture in order to make confessions that subsequently, of course, are no longer recognised. The accusations are similar: waging war against God. She does not have access to either a lawyer or a defence counsel. There is also the case mentioned just now of the young man, Ebrahim Hamidi, a minor who also has no lawyer, and the case of Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist and human rights defender. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience, and she is currently locked up in a cage in which she cannot move her arms or legs. She is also threatened with death. I believe that it is to the credit of our Parliament that it is rallying in support of Mrs Mohammadi-Ashtiani’s case and of all these situations. We demand the abolition of the death penalty, a moratorium on all these executions, the immediate release of all those who have taken part in peaceful protests and, of course, the release of minors, because many minors are also sentenced to death in that country. We also urgently call for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit the prisoners. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Mrs Parvanova’s report on the social integration of women belonging to ethnic minority groups comes at just the right time, when the French Government is embarking on a huge operation to expel Roma men, women and children – the most disadvantaged and most discriminated-against citizens of Europe. Roma women are the victims of double discrimination because of their origin and their gender. They are discriminated against with regard to the exercise of the fundamental rights that are the right to education, to employment and to healthcare. The violence they suffer as women constitutes another form of discrimination. We must demand that all Member States respect the fundamental rights of the largest ethnic minority in Europe and, first and foremost, of these women. Forced labour, trafficking, forced sterilisation, child marriage and countless abortions characterise the lives of these women, and hounding them from town to town, moving them from one end of Europe to the other, will not improve their situation. It is the duty of every Member State, including France, to guarantee the protection of these women and to guarantee the education of Roma children, both boys and girls. This is the key to their freedom and to their independence. To be free and independent, they need stability and support; expulsions are unacceptable. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Madam President, freedom of religion is not guaranteed in Pakistan. In 2009, an increase in violent attacks against religious minorities has been observed, and that includes murders. In addition, nearly 80% of people from minority groups live below the poverty line. However, this is not the only problem with regard to the violation of human rights in Pakistan: other issues include a restriction on freedom of assembly, threats against civil society organisations, the arrest of trade unionists, kidnappings and the murder of journalists. Since Pakistan declared its support for the war against terrorism waged by the United States, hundreds, if not thousands, of people suspected of having links with terrorist groups have been arbitrarily detained: arrests without warrant, detentions with no legal basis or access to a lawyer, detentions in unspecified locations, forced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture. In the only prison in Lahore, 4 651 prisoners were held in 2009, while the prison has a capacity of only 1 050 prisoners. Violence against women continues to increase: rapes, suicides, acid attacks and women being burned. I would need not two minutes or two hours but two whole days to describe the ordeal suffered by young girls and women in Pakistan. It is within this context that this House, which is concerned about respect for women, freedom of conscience and human rights, is preparing to use its new power of veto for the conclusion of a readmission agreement between the European Union and Pakistan, thus demanding additional guarantees on the conditions for the implementation of such an agreement on the readmission of Pakistani nationals and Afghans who have transited through Pakistan.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would also like to echo the condolences that were just expressed by our fellow Members. We support wholeheartedly the resolution on the mass atrocities in Nigeria, which unfortunately represent only one aspect of the bleak human rights picture in that country. I would like, in the time I have been allotted, to speak about Nigeria’s prisons, which are full of prisoners whose rights are systematically violated. As a 2008 report by Amnesty International revealed, 65% of the prisoners in that country have never been found guilty of any crime. Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years. The problems are such that Nigeria has no choice but to recognise them and to promise to reform the system. We are still waiting for this reform. I am focusing my speech on the prisons because the current situation has once again reminded us of just how little value is put on the life of a human being in Nigeria, and even more so in the prisons. The National Economic Council of Nigeria has announced its plan to execute hundreds of death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in the prisons: killing to reduce prison overpopulation. There is nothing more shocking, especially when it is certain that many of these death-row inmates are innocent and the majority of them did not have the right to a fair trial, and particularly as in February 2009 the Nigerian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs declared before the UN that his country was applying a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. This is why, during the vote, I will table an oral amendment to denounce this recent move by several Nigerian governors. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as I indicated during the debate, I propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6: ‘Calls on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons, which would constitute a gross violation of human rights; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to Nigeria’s commitments at international level’.

Mr President, the resolution on Corporal Gilad Shalit, which we are examining today, supplements the many resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament on the human rights situation in the Middle East. Corporal Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage for 1 355 days, must be released as soon as possible. We demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released. The young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who has been detained by the Israeli authorities since 13 March 2005, must be released. The children imprisoned in Israel, in violation of the provisions of international law and the conventions on the rights of the child, must be released. The militants of the Non­Violent Popular Resistance Against the Occupation, such as Abdallah Abu Rahmah from Bil’in, must be released. The elected representatives, the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council – including Marwan Barghouti – must be released. It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East. The solutions do not lie in one­upmanship, exercised under repressive and violent conditions, an example of which was the assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai, which we condemn, not least because it makes securing the release of Gilad Shalit even more difficult.

 Mr President, the Roma issue is being keenly felt in my region, the west of France. In Nantes, over 1 000 Roma are being expelled from one place after another due to a lack of government regulated sites in which to accommodate them. The few municipalities with facilities to accommodate the Roma, for example, Rezé and Indre, located in the Nantes conurbation, are stretched to the limit and lack the support of the public authorities. The most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties. Responses cannot be local. They must be global. Inclusion of the Roma must be incorporated in every European Union policy in order to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these European citizens. I would also like to draw attention to the specific situation of the women. The problems faced by Roma women are particularly striking, for example, in relation to marital violence or unwanted pregnancies. In France then, according to Médecins du monde
, one in two Roma women, or 43% of that group, will have had an abortion by the age of 22. The average age for the first pregnancy is 17. Only 10% of Roma women use contraception. The European Union must therefore include the gender perspective in all studies and laws that concern the Roma. Education must be a major priority. We must act urgently with the Roma communities to make them aware of their fundamental rights and to facilitate their access to public services. I hope that, at the second European summit on Roma inclusion, the European Union will show its determination to deal with the Roma issue in a comprehensive fashion. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, our debate today is motivated by three aspects concerning the generalised system of tariff preferences. First, the current regulation expires on 31 December 2011. To allow the European Parliament to exercise the powers it possesses under the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission must give us a new draft regulation by June 2010 at the latest. Secondly, the way the Generalised System of Preferences+ (GSP+) operates is anything but perfect. Who decides the list of beneficiary countries and on the basis of which criteria? Amazing! Who actually monitors the implementation of the 27 international conventions on social and environmental issues that are a requirement for becoming a beneficiary of the GSP+? We do not know. What results has the GSP+ shown? Has it resulted in sustainable development, the diversification of production and the creation of respectable employment, or rather in the proliferation of short­term contracts, an increase in the number of abandoned farms and the concentration of large holdings dedicated to export? We have no idea. Therefore, a thorough reform of the regulation is required to guarantee democratic control and to ensure that the measures taken do indeed achieve the desired objectives. However, the real reason for the debate this evening is the regrettable case of Colombia. Until today, the Commission has refused to launch an investigation into the very serious human rights violations in that country. Such an investigation is, however, provided for in the regulation. It is inconceivable, given the values advocated by the European Union, that, in seeking profits in the dairy, automotive, pharmaceuticals, telecoms and banking sector for our own multinationals, the EU should abandon GSP conditionality and, in the past few days, rush into a free trade agreement with Colombia. This is a fatal blow to Colombia’s trade unions, small farmers and consumers and to its national industrial production. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, the London Conference on Afghanistan has led to panic sweeping through the heart of Afghan society, and women are particularly afraid. The peace plan agreed on by 70 countries includes a fund to help reintegrate the Taliban and a Loya Jirga – peace council – must take place within the coming months in order for this reconciliation to be put into effect. Women do not want to and must not pay the price for this reconciliation. The Taliban are still demanding the suppression of women’s rights and the return of Sharia. It is to be feared that the Loya Jirga will modify the Constitution and that the articles protecting women’s rights will disappear; in particular, Article 22 of Chapter 2. Today, 8 March 2010, I solemnly request that the European Union act as guarantor of the future of Afghanistan’s women, as the re-emergence of the most femicidal regime in history cannot be countenanced.

Mr President, in Israel, Judge Goldstone’s work is demonised and completely discredited in the eyes of the public. At the same time, a violent smear campaign is being conducted against human rights defenders, notably the New Israel Fund, a foundation which funds the main Israeli organisations for the defence of human rights and, in particular, against its president, Naomi Chazan, a former Member of the Knesset, an academic and intellectual known for her commitment to the defence of women’s rights and peace. Thirteen pacifist groups, such as Bethlehem and Breaking the Silence, are the victims of a veritable witch-hunt. The European Union must provide unfailing support to human rights defenders in all countries including, of course, Israel, whose impunity is an insult to democratic values. The European Union must protect Israel from its own demons. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Back in 2006, the UN acknowledged that the most vulnerable populations and the poorest populations were the main victims of climate change. The fact is, women form the majority in both categories. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, although women are already discriminated against in terms of access to and control of land, the increasing scarcity of cultivable soil due to drought reduces their means of existence even further. A recent report forecasts that in 2050, a billion people will have fled from hostile environments. The loss of security of these climate migrants, forced to take refuge in makeshift camps, raises the level of threat against women. However, we have to admit that in the last 15 years, not one European legislative text on the environment has included the aspect of gender. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I therefore call on the European Union and its Member States to integrate the perspective of equality between women and men in all impact assessments, legislation and policies regarding the environment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is being threatened with strangulation. Subjected to a strict Israeli blockade since 2007, in 2009, Gaza’s population suffered the bloody attack that prompted the Goldstone Report, which was damning for the Israeli military authorities accused of war crimes. Today, it is the Egyptian authorities that have set about building an underground metal barrier in order to prevent any supplies getting through the tunnels. When will there be a stop to this collective punishment imposed on men, women and children, whose suffering is being manipulated on a political stage from a different era? The European Union must act. The European Union has all the trumps as Israel’s main economic partner and the principal contributor of aid to the Palestinian Territories. The Israeli Government will only accept a change of policy under pressure from the international community. The EU can play a decisive role in the resumption of the peace process and in the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state within the borders established in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Madam President, yes, we will have to emerge from the Afghan trap into which we fell because of the policy pursued by George Bush. However, the question is not when, but how, we pull out of Afghanistan. If the countless mistakes made by the international community are not called into question, we are in danger of completely losing the confidence and support of the Afghan population, for the benefit of the Taliban. The militarisation of humanitarian aid and development aid must stop because it is creating confusion in people’s minds and discrediting the NGOs. We must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the Afghan reformists. Why is Europe in Afghanistan? Because the United States said so, or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence? We need to strengthen the most effective Afghan structures, to prioritise investment in public services – education, health and transport – and to support good governance of local powers, since the culture of these countries requires us to reflect on the relevance of the nation state. Europe should, for instance, support Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan Province. Her appointment is a first in the history of this country where, you will recall, we went in 2001 to help the female population. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the 2000s have been characterised in Europe by a proliferation of security laws: surveillance, repression, detention and imprisonment. Budgets linked to these policies have exploded. Yet violence against women is not in decline. It follows that, in 2008, 156 women died from injuries inflicted by their spouse in France, where almost one in ten women is a victim of marital violence. The security measures implemented for video surveillance, filing or biometrics do not meet the real security needs of women. This violence affects all women in all countries, whatever their origin, social background or religion. It is linked to discrimination based on gender. Sexism, just like racism, consists in denying another person an alter ego status. How do we combat sexism? What we require is strong political will to inform, prevent and protect, the political will to abolish all forms of discrimination in which violence takes root. Is not the safety of more than half of all European citizens, in other words female citizens, worth a substantial political investment? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have rightly spoken about tax evasion. You know that this struggle is extremely important for us, because it is a struggle that revolves around economic efficiency and social justice. Talking about these matters is all very well, but we would like to see action. Where are the Commission’s statements? Where is the pressure from the Commission to help Greece to try to recover the EUR 100 to 200 billion that are in Switzerland, according to the Greek Government’s estimates? I know that this is not necessarily Greece’s priority. Greece holds the primary responsibility for this inability to genuinely levy tax. All the same, where is the action by the Commission to exert pressure on Switzerland, so that the money can be taxed and then return to Greece? Just now, Daniel Cohn-Bendit was talking about what President Obama did in relation to the Swiss banks and banking secrecy. Where is the initiative by the European Commission to do exactly what Mr Obama did, namely, to impose an extra-territorial law that is binding and eliminates banking secrecy? Where is the Commission’s initiative to have a European list of tax havens? On the OECD’s blacklist, there is one state, or two states, or, from time to time, three states; they sign mutual conventions, and then there is no one left on the list. All of a sudden, the struggle is empty, because the blacklist is empty. Where is the Commission’s initiative? I want to see concrete answers, because it is all very well to make these grand declarations before Parliament, but it is actually much better to take tangible political action to put pressure on these states. I am fully aware that these states constitute the main obstacle to progress. We need you, however, to put pressure on the states. Mr Barroso, I would like to put a final question to you, not about tax havens, but about austerity. When we have informal discussions with your departments and those of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, this is what your officials tell us. When you put all the austerity policies and the requirements that have now been imposed by the Commission to reduce budget deficits into the same economic model, it is not possible to show that there is truly a path that will enable us to reduce the deficits. In fact, growth is being damaged to such a degree, and tax revenue is being decreased to such an extent, that the end result is a greater deficit, not a lower one. That is the case, for example, in Spain. The debate is also a live issue in the Netherlands, and perhaps soon will be in France too. Mr Barroso, the reality is that when you use these figures, it does not work. When are you going to admit this? When are you going to change direction? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Ms Kroes, in your speech on behalf of the Commission you said: ‘Eurobonds without fiscal consolidation will not work’. You are quite right. However, what we have today is fiscal consolidation without Eurobonds. What we are proposing here in Parliament is a balance between the two. The package you are proposing today is unbalanced. These are not our words. Listen to the rating agencies. When Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded France a few weeks ago, what it was saying was: ‘Austerity alone does not work’. You do not have to believe me, you do not have to believe the left here in the European Parliament, but you can believe the rating agencies, if you listen more closely to them. The challenge is to put in place today a roadmap because we do not underestimate the legal challenges and technical complexities. It is precisely because it is complicated, however, that we need to start immediately in order to send a message and prepare for the battle as quickly as possible. Over and above the technical and legal issues, there is also the political dimension. In Europe today do we want to do what the United States did 220 years ago, which was to pool, gradually, its public debt as a sign of solidarity and a reflection of a political will to create a political union? I believe that a majority of this House would wish to move in that direction. Surprise us in the European Commission! For once, be truly European and ambitious! Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, there are two democratic institutions in Europe: the Council, which represents the Heads of State or Government, who have been elected, and the European Parliament, which is elected by universal suffrage. For two years, the Council has had sole responsibility for resolving the crisis, and for two years, it has failed. It has failed every quarter by holding another last-chance summit. I will see you in another three months at the next last-chance summit, because last week’s summit completely failed to resolve the issues that were on the table. When you listen to the rating agencies – the infamous financial markets that you are keen to reassure – what do they say? They do not say, ‘more austerity, more discipline’. They say, ‘a comprehensive package including budgetary discipline’. No one is disputing the fact that we need to adopt this approach, but it is just one aspect of the package, not the only one. We are well aware that, today, with this package, with the outcome of this summit, you have added to the citizens’ concerns without even reassuring the markets. In other words, it is a complete waste of time. I shall see you again in three months’ time! However, there is a second European institution that is democratic, namely the European Parliament. As Mr Schulz, Mr Daul and Ms Harms said, it is our responsibility to recognise today that we need to take the lead in establishing an alternative crisis plan, one that offers a different approach from that of the Council, which is all about failure. It is our responsibility not just to vote on a resolution, but to use all the powers bestowed on us by the Treaties to their full extent, to shoulder our responsibilities and to be capable, between us, of reaching compromises. If we prove incapable of reaching compromises between us, then, at that point, we will no longer have the legitimacy to criticise others who are incapable of reaching them. However, we have three months to get there. We have a responsibility to do so; the people of Europe are watching us. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, the report we are voting on today concludes a year’s work and is the first time that the European Union will ban a financial product used to speculate on the debt of states. This report shows clearly that we have the political will to work together in this European Parliament and that we are capable of ensuring that our voices are heard, capable of negotiating, and capable of bringing the states round to our point of view. We in the European Parliament were the only ones to defend this idea of banning uncovered credit default swaps and types of speculation on sovereign debt – the Commission was against the idea – and, in the end, we have won the battle. I therefore urge you to vote in favour of this text. I am very pleased with it and I would like to thank very sincerely the European Parliament negotiators, especially Markus Ferber and Robert Goebbels, who helped me in these negotiations. (Applause) Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, in your speech you talked about peer pressure and market forces, but I think you forgot to mention people pressure because, when I look at the plan that you adopted yesterday evening, I see that you are applying the same approach to Italy as you are to Greece. This is an unpleasant approach and it does not work. If you want to increase the problems we already have in Greece by applying the same approach to Italy tomorrow, please feel free to do so, but I am sure that people pressure will change the landscape. You have not mentioned the word ‘tax’ at all. Several MEPs have mentioned in this House that tax evasion was a major problem in Europe. Our region has the greatest fiscal competition in the world. We are a single market but we do not have fiscal harmonisation. We simply must resolve this paradoxical situation. You know the figures. In Italy, according to the government, EUR 120 billion escape the Italian tax system, EUR 200 billion in Greece, EUR 100 billion in France and EUR 150 billion in Germany. There is no point in calling on casual workers, the unemployed, junior civil servants and the retired to make a contribution if you do not make it a priority to tackle tax evasion. You have not said a single word about this. This is an outrageous and unjust shortcoming in the outcome of yesterday’s summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, President Barroso, I would like to ask you a question. If it is no trouble to you, would you mind listening to it? I am not going to make a long speech. My question is a specific one: do you know how much Greek money – according to the Greek Government itself – is deposited in Switzerland and escaping Greek taxation? EUR 200 billion, which is the equivalent of Greece’s annual GDP and of two-thirds of Greece’s debt. I am still waiting for your initiative to impose taxation on this money which has escaped the Greek tax system. I am also waiting for a strong initiative on this matter from Greece’s socialist government. It would have no macroeconomic impact on Greece, since this money has already gone elsewhere, but this policy would be completely legitimate from a social point of view. However, in order to take this initiative, the Greek Government needs the EU. You will argue that this is complicated, but there is a very simple example: the United States, which is fighting a daily battle to have Swiss banking secrecy lifted for its own citizens and which is winning that battle. Meanwhile, we are either doing nothing, or doing things in an utterly disorganised and counterproductive manner, as the UK and Germany have just done by signing an agreement with Switzerland limiting the EU’s scope for action. It is up to you to take an initiative: EUR 200 billion is a very large sum. We cannot ask European taxpayers to show solidarity if rich Greek citizens do not show any either. Pascal Canfin

 Mr President, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, Mr Rehn, you have focused your comments in this debate on economic governance, that is to say, on the package of six directives that are currently being negotiated. The specific purpose of this report is to integrate this work but, also, to go beyond it. It also aims to indicate a path, a vision that goes beyond the very short-term discussions in which you are rightly involved. However, do take the time to read this report because it outlines a majority view. It is not just the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is a vision that results from a compromise, a compromise reached by a majority. Examining its contents provides a breath of fresh air with regard to the current situation. What is the issue at stake today? The issue is working out who will be paying for the crisis, who will be paying for these 20 percentage points of public debt, accumulated over three years, to save the markets, the banks, and Europe from a very significant recession. By continuing to focus on the issue of public finances, you are targeting the fire-fighter rather than the arsonist. If the Member States have spent 20 points of their Gross Domestic Product in additional debt, it was not for the pleasure of doing so, but because they had no other choice. In solely considering the consequences and limiting yourselves to a European policy focusing on managing the consequences of this crisis, and not the causes, I think you are missing the point and you are causing pro-European opinion among Europeans to become significantly weaker. We know that today, we are threatened by this trend and this isolationism. The second major issue which this report seeks to address concerns the balance of power between the Member States and the markets. We created the euro, in part, to prevent the markets from speculating on our currencies. That is what we saw in the 1990s. Currently, we are at the point at which we must prevent the markets from speculating on our public debts and, in order to do so, we have two tools available to us. The first is Eurobonds, which would involve mutualising our debt to ensure a deep liquid market, such that it is no longer possible to speculate against the single public debt market. The function of the second tool is to limit the capacity of the financial markets to speculate on public debt through a number of instruments. This is the path that a majority in Parliament is ready to propose to you. Seize this opportunity, President-in-Office, on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission.

Mr President, I wanted to propose submitting the report on the legislative proposal to the scrutiny of this House, for the same reasons that we did so regarding the report on derivatives. We have already had four negotiation meetings with the Council. We are now sending a very strong political message, but we are not voting at first reading in order that we can continue the discussions and negotiations in a very practical manner starting next week or in September. I would therefore like to request a report concerning the vote on the legislative proposal. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the positive atmosphere he has created in the debates we have been able to have. They have resulted in an ambitious and responsible text on which there is very broad agreement in Parliament. I would also like to emphasise two points on which we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, presented proposals, and which were subsequently taken up by all the political groups that supported this text. The first point concerns harmonisation by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the rules on collateral-related competition between clearing houses. We know that one of the great dangers of this text is that risks will be concentrated in clearing houses when they were previously spread around. They will be concentrated in clearing houses, which actually compete with each other by reducing the level of security within the system. No provision was made in the initial Commission proposal to prevent clearing houses competing on the level of security, an important criterion of which is the level of collateral. The second point that I wished to emphasise is our proposal to expand Parliament’s text; we have removed the threshold set by the Commission which limited the transmission of information – the reporting of trading information – because not all derivatives will be traded in clearing houses. We have therefore made provision for all information, be it on over-the-counter trading or on trading carried out in clearing houses, to be transmitted to the regulator so that he has an overview of the risks that exist. I hope that the Council will be receptive to this important development of Parliament’s text. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this report concerns short selling and the supervision of credit default swaps, those products that insure debt against default, in particular state default. The origins of this text lie in the Greek crisis, which began in spring 2010. Following certain movements on the financial markets that had been observed, a political request was put to Commissioner Barnier and to the European Commission to establish European rules on short selling and on sovereign debt speculation tools. The Commission drafted that regulation in September. This was followed by the adoption of our position in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March, and of the Council position in May. Since then we have been negotiating, because we have already had five trialogues, which have enabled us to reach a number of possible compromises. Although they are not here, I should like to thank the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who took part in these trialogues and helped to move this matter forward. However, after those four or five negotiating sessions, we and the shadow rapporteurs who voted by a majority for this text in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in other words, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which I represent – took the decision to vote in the July part-session for this text, but not for the legislative proposal, in order to send two messages. The first message consists in saying that we want to carry on negotiating with the Council because it has been almost a year since the Commission tabled this text and because, on this issue as on others, Parliament wishes to adopt a responsible yet ambitious attitude. We want these texts; we want the rules on financial markets to change. Too often, we have to wait for the Council, which clearly takes much longer to make its decisions than we do. Therefore, we want to carry on negotiating, which means that we will not be voting for the legislative proposal tomorrow. However, we also want to send three messages on the substance in order to reaffirm the positions adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which will become the positions of the European Parliament too when it adopts them – by a very large majority, I think – tomorrow. The first issue concerns the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). In our version we have strengthened the role of ESMA, and you have reminded us many times, Commissioner, of the importance of that institution when it comes to ensuring the consistency of the single-market rules on financial services. I have to say that the position adopted in the Council – to have a red line that is an absolute red line for us, to create a right of veto for States on European regulatory issues concerning sovereign debt – is completely unacceptable. The second point that I wished to raise is that we in Parliament want a simple rule: when you sell an asset, be it a share or a bond, you must be able to know for certain where to find it; there must be an agreement with the person who is going to lend it to you. This is what is known as the ‘hard locate’ rule in technical speak. This is Parliament’s position, and I think it is a sensible one. The final point that I should like to emphasise, and which is obviously a key element of the discussions we are having, is the ban on naked credit default swaps. This position is shared by a large majority of the European Parliament. We do not see how it is possible, in financial terms, to cover oneself against a risk with a credit default swap without being liable for that risk, in other words without owning the bond of the country that issued the security. It is a nonsense and it opens the door to speculation. To conclude, I would say that the current debates on Greece prove us right, because some of the arguments made to limit the Greek restructuring consist in saying, ‘Yes, but some people have speculated. If the debt is restructured, they are going to make money without having invested in Greece.’ That is exactly what we want to put a stop to. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, I just wanted to say something to my fellow Member, Mr Kamall − since he is one of the negotiators of this text and is very familiar with it, and if he is not, he only has to read it – concerning his argument that credit default swaps (CDSs) are used as proxy hedges and therefore should not be banned. As the text says, when CDSs are used for proxy hedging, they are not uncovered. It would be helpful, therefore, if you could change your argument or read the text, because we are debating for nothing otherwise. (Applause)
 The second point that I wished to make is that we really want to complete this text because we feel that the situation is urgent. No one is saying that CDSs caused the Greek crisis. It would be absurd to think that. However, they are clearly being used to fan the flames by financial operators whose sole aim is to exacerbate the crisis so that they can make money at some point. While we are on the subject of CDSs, I should like to tell you that this text only covers the purchase of these swaps. This presents another problem, which was also raised by Mr Kamall, concerning the fact that operators who sell CDSs, such as US banks and hedge funds, are supposed to provide a guarantee against the risk of default to banks such as BNP, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. For those banks, it is a way of getting the risk off their balance sheets. However, those who sell CDSs, such as hedge funds, have a lot less capital than the banks. This tool has the effect of reducing capital requirements and hence the security of the system. Since you are working on the Capital Requirements Directive 4, I should like it if you could also cover the sale of CDSs and the obligations incumbent on sellers of CDSs, rather than just focusing on buyers, as is the case in this text. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, as you know, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is traditionally very attached to the EIB. We believe that it is an extremely important public policy instrument, and it is because we are very attached to it that we are also very demanding of it – the two go hand in hand. Our view of the EIB is that, ultimately, it is a bank in its own right, and as such, it is subject to bank constraints, which must be taken into account. Several of my fellow Members rightly referred to the fact that the EIB ought perhaps to take account of new constraints linked to the banking sector. At the same time, it is a truly exceptional bank, because it is indeed funded by taxpayers’ money. It is also there to do what the others are not doing, and to adopt rules that go beyond what the private sector can do. I should like to stress one or two points on which I feel that the EIB could do even better, even though progress has been made in recent months. The first point concerns the issue of tax havens. This is an extremely important fight not only for us, but also, I think, for a very large majority of my fellow Members in this House. The crisis showed that tax havens obscure, undermine and weaken the entire financial system and the world economy. Therefore, in this report, the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens. I believe that that practice should be stopped. I am well aware that you have operational constraints on the ground, but there is a political point here, which is that, if you are the power behind Europe, you have to fight battles. If you fight battles, then I think that the battle against tax havens should be one of them. As for us, we would obviously like to go further; in other words, we would like you to attach conditions to EIB loans to businesses that are not part of the entire value chain in tax havens and which are, at the very least, on the OECD’s blacklist, which is currently being revised. The second point that we wished to raise concerns the issue of monitoring and governance. Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now. I believe that we should extend the choice, that we should increase the level of joint accountability so that the choice of projects involving taxpayers’ money is made as democratically and as transparently as possible. The third point is about measuring the benefits of your action. You measure them in financial terms too, of course. As I was saying earlier, you are a bank in your own right, which means that you have challenges to meet in terms of the risk/reward ratio. However, you aim to provide other benefits too, and that is why public money is used. You aim to provide benefits in terms of social cohesion, in terms of the fight against poverty, in terms of environmental protection. I think that you could make still more progress in reporting, in measuring these non-financial benefits, which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy. I think that, rather than setting the financial benefits against the non-financial benefits, you should carry out as broad an assessment as possible, and not limit it to monetary and financial issues alone. Lastly, the final point of my speech will relate to climate change. The report specifically states that you must pursue all the EU’s objectives. One of the official objectives of the European Union is to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue to finance coal-fired power plants, which have a 40-year life span and which emit huge amounts of CO2

 – (FR) 
I have a very simple answer to that. I believe that the EIB has cost UK taxpayers a lot less than other, completely private UK banks have cost them, and I believe that the general interest, just like that of UK taxpayers, is far better served by the EIB than by other UK banks that the taxpayer has had to bail out. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that many of my fellow Members will have remembered that the background to this package for the Single Market comes from the Monti report, and the Monti report recommended a considerable compromise between those who advocate more competition, if you like, and those who advocate giving more weight to social, environmental and tax-related aspects. I believe that, here in Parliament – and as long as the texts are not unpicked in the votes we shall be having in plenary in a few hours – we have succeeded in finding this compromise, including in the 14 proposals that emerge from the three reports as a whole. I also know that you are having discussions, in the College of Commissioners, to determine which central themes you will be retaining, and we shall clearly be paying great attention to whether this balance found within Parliament and desired by Mr Monti is taken up and extended to the 12 central project themes to which you have referred. I would like to highlight three items which seem particularly important to me, further to what Mrs Turunen said a little while ago on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The first aspect concerns competition. The issue of the Single Market is to ascertain where we can focus competition. Do we focus competition on innovation, on products or do we focus competition on the rules, through environmental dumping or social dumping? I believe we have indeed struck a balance here in Parliament – and I hope you can carry it over into the Commission – which is to say ‘yes’ to more competition through innovation, ‘yes’ to more capital investment, but ‘yes’ also to a social clause, ‘yes’ to environmental standards that ensure that competition does not lead to regulatory dumping. Those are the two aspects that I believe are fundamental to our compromise. The second item that I would like to highlight concerns the tax-related aspects. When you proposed the consolidated corporate tax base for multinational companies in your first version of the Single Market Act, it was not an optional proposal: in other words, all companies had to be subject to this consolidated tax base. In the proposal put out by the Commission 10 days or so ago, it is an optional measure: in other words, instead of building up an aspect of the Single Market, the Commission is tearing one down. You will be adding a new system, you will be adding a layer of complexity, you will be adding regulatory arbitrage instead of creating tax harmonisation. The proposal tabled by the Commission a fortnight ago runs totally counter to what we in Parliament want and to what you had proposed. The last point I want to highlight very quickly is the notion of reciprocity, in exactly the same terms as you have done. The Single Market accounts for 500 million people; it is an economic entity, but it is also a political entity which must afford us more influence in shaping globalisation. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I wanted to clarify why we voted in favour of this Single Market Act. I think it is a step forward. Parliament managed to find the right compromises that do not flush the text of its content but, instead, put real pressure on those who, in the Commission, want the Single Market to continue to adopt a purely free market approach, without including social issues, tax issues or environmental issues. I also merely wanted to clarify that paragraph 54, which deals with public services, services of general interest, is problematic, and we therefore voted against part of this paragraph, which continues to call, ideologically but in veiled terms, for further liberalisation. We argue instead in favour of European public services and securing the European framework, leaving each Member State the option to continue organising public services as they wish, especially at territorial level.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission, and the European Union in particular, to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned. As you know, Brussels is the international lobbying capital, before Washington. There are more lobbyists in Brussels than in Washington, and one of the ways in which they exert their influence on the Commission is through these famous expert groups. I am a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You have, for example, a group of banking experts. Ninety-five per cent of the members of that expert group are bankers, and not just any bankers: only bankers from finance and investment banks, money market banks, and all the major US banks – J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – are represented in it. On the other hand, there are no NGOs or trade unions in that expert group. The idea that the Commission should be advised only by investment bankers, and US investment bankers at that, with regard to changing banking rules seems totally surreal to me after the financial crisis we have gone through. Hence there are some very precise questions and some very precise points in this oral question being put to you: are you going to change the composition of these expert groups? Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided? In the European Parliament, in fact, this is a completely transpartisan issue. There are left-wing MEPs, right-wing MEPs, Green MEPs and liberals who are very interested in these issues. Why were we not involved earlier in the reforms that you have introduced? Pascal Canfin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, in 2006, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the Services Directive, and today, we consider the report assessing the implementation of this Services Directive, previously known as the Bolkestein Directive, to be equally unsatisfactory. The Verts/ALE Group will therefore vote against this report. I should like to make it clear, Mrs Gebhardt, that you did everything you could to achieve the best possible compromises. However, I believe that some red lines have unfortunately been crossed in this report, which means that we cannot vote in favour of it. I should also like to state that you took great care to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I certainly do not wish to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union, either. If France, for example, transposed the Services Directive and chose to include day nurseries in it, when almost all of the other countries chose to do the opposite, it is clearly the responsibility of the French Government and not of the European Union. Therefore, the Verts/ALE Group is certainly not voting against this report in order to criticise the way in which the directive has been transposed in France. It is doing so on account of two key points. The first is that we asked time and again, during the discussions, for the Member States to assess the impact that the initial transposition of the Services Directive had on the quality of jobs and services. Unfortunately, that assessment of the impact on job and service quality could not be integrated into the report. We also called for an assessment of the cost impact for public authorities. Every time we try to take steps to regulate the financial markets, for example, we are told that it will cost a fortune. Here, we have a very high cost for public authorities at a time when budgets are tight, and no one wants to assess it in order to weigh up the pros and cons of the Services Directive. My final point is in the form of a question to Commissioner Barnier. Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain an assurance in this report that the European Commission will finally take note of Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and present a proposal for a directive on public services. Can you tell us when the Commission will finally face up to its responsibilities on this point? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn, I genuinely hope that you will look at the work done by the European Parliament on the subjects we have been dealing with today – the Berès report and the Feio report – because, of course, we are now working as colegislators on economic governance. I can tell you that together with four pro-European groups in Parliament at least, we have made a genuine effort to work on compromises that will achieve something. We have just come from the discussions to try to tie up the problems. Some people are talking about the budget, some are talking about tax measures, and some are talking about governance. What we need today is for the Commission – and it is your role to do this, we are trying to do it and it is your role to do it also – to propose an overall package: something in the spirit of the Monti report that is also along the lines of what Michel Barnier has been trying to do in the context of the internal market. I am waiting for an overall package from Mr Barroso, which should show us how to get ourselves out of the economic crisis. It should not just be about macro-economic governance, but should be along the lines of reading three or four dossiers on macro-economics, tax and the budget and then saying ‘here is the package’. I am sure that if you do that, you will have a very large majority in the European Parliament to support the initiative. If we only look at the issue of public finance, for example, two or three years ago, the Commission and its departments were themselves saying that, of all the countries, Spain was sticking to the Stability and Growth Pact most closely and that Spain’s public finances were in order. The problem is that the instability came from elsewhere and now Spain is in a terrible situation, as is Ireland. We can clearly see that focusing on public finances alone will not help us resolve the crisis. The compromises that we have proposed in the various reports that have been presented today, which will be voted on tomorrow, represent the sum of these issues. They are a way of saying that, yes, we do need to strengthen budgetary discipline. Of course we do. However, to ensure that this budgetary discipline does not lead to social breakdown, but only to public expenditure cuts, we need, at the same time, a European budget package that will finance investment and a tax package that will allow Member States to impose certain taxes. My last question for Mr Rehn, and for Mr Barroso especially, is therefore: are you genuinely in favour of the common corporate tax basis? Do you genuinely support it? It has been shelved by the Commission for 10 years now and for 10 years, you have failed to deal with the matter. It is now time that you did so. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,

 Madam President, Commissioner, my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted. It is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors. I must say that the ability to strictly limit the variable remuneration of directors of banks assisted by the public purse, and even the possibility to defer up to 70% of traders’ bonuses in the long-term interests of the bank and, potentially therefore, to take account of the risks taken and the negative effects of these risks in order to reduce these bonuses, are important rules which translate the G20’s commitments in principle into real figures at European level. However, I must also say that in negotiations with all the other shadow rapporteurs and with the rapporteur herself, we constantly came up against a lack of commitment by the States, against the huge gap between fine rhetoric on the regulation of capitalism, on the raising of the moral standards of capitalism, on the one hand, and the negotiating positions of the Council and the main States, which constantly refused to agree figures, and tried to reduce the scope of and water down all of our ambitious proposals, on the other. I must say, Commissioner, that the Commission has largely been on our side in this struggle. Therefore, I think that this is an achievement which we can share. Now, there is an important issue at stake. As we lost, we have had to make compromises. We lost a number of battles aimed at agreeing figures, and we have had to replace these figures with a number of words, often rather portmanteau words, such as ‘justified’, ‘appropriate’ and ‘balanced’. The challenge now is for the future European banking authority to translate these principles and portmanteau words into real figures, which will then be applied by all banks and all Member States. I would therefore like to know, Mr Barnier, how you intend to apply pressure on and strictly monitor this future process so that it does not distort the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, as you know, there are two ways to reduce deficits. Expenditure can be cut or taxes can be increased. All States can cut expenditure at the same time, although separately, without needing any European coordination. However, to increase taxes and, more specifically, taxes on capital, companies, profits and banks, they do need European coordination. Your communication last week contained absolutely no mention at all of this issue. My question, which is a fairly common one among Members from all groups, is as follows: over the course of the next few weeks, are you going to propose a tax coordination plan to provide Member States with the means of recovering margins for manoeuvre so that they can increase certain taxes, which is something they are unable to do separately? This is the added value which the European Commission can provide at the present time. Unfortunately, you do not have any plans in this area. Mr Verhofstadt was saying that you had a right to take the initiative. In the current situation, you have a duty to take the initiative in this area. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, Mr Barnier, in your speech you mentioned Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted to you a few days ago. There is a very interesting aspect in Mr Monti’s report, and that is the emphasis it places on the pressing need for us to move on to the next stage of fiscal cooperation. It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied, but that if they are applied solely to expenditure, through cuts in expenditure, this will almost certainly lead to a recession. It is therefore crucial to use both pillars and, in particular, the fiscal pillar, to enable the Member States to collect a number of additional receipts from the economic activities and economic operators whose tax burden has been repeatedly reduced over the last few years: the profits from companies, capital, and financial transactions. To do this, we absolutely must have European coordination. This is the conclusion reached in Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted two days ago. However, there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission. There is no mention whatsoever of this issue in Mr Rehn’s communication published a few days ago. This is one of the major pillars, one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time. Do this, and this will establish the link – Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy, the report on the governance of the euro area, on the single market, and employment and education issues. We are well aware that, if we abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact – which, incidentally, is vital – but do so only by cutting expenditure, then we are on course for social regression and economic recession. Therefore, my question is very clear: Mr Barnier, as a representative of the Commission, what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks? How are you going to convince your colleagues – assuming that you are already convinced yourself – of the need for an action plan, for a fiscal coordination plan so that Member States are able once more to raise new revenues on the basis of a number of agreements? What are your proposals? You are not entitled to stay silent. The Commission has a right to initiate legislation, but, today, on these issues, that right has become a duty. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, our public finances are in a situation of crisis and we know that part of the solution may lie in reducing some spending, but that a large part of the solution is in Member States’ ability to raise more funds. The issue at stake, therefore, is knowing what type of tax may be increased, what type of tax must be increased, and what the consequences of these tax increases will be. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance estimates that it would be difficult to significantly raise the taxes paid by small businesses, which create the majority of jobs. It is difficult to increase the taxes paid by families – with the possible exception of those paid by the richest – because in the majority of cases, these are already high enough, particularly in Europe. The question, therefore, is: which taxes should be increased? If taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises are not increased and nor is VAT, other possibilities will inevitably have to be sought. We estimate that a tax on financial transactions is, in the end, the least painful tax for the European economy. It is the tax with the least negative consequences for the global competitiveness of the European economy. Moreover, the cost of financial transactions has diminished enormously over the last ten years or so, both because of a certain number of technical improvements – if they can be called that – and because of European regulation. In fact, these reductions in costs have been entirely absorbed by the financial industry and the banks. It would not be totally unjustified if, by means of a tax on financial transactions, part of the profit saved by the banks from these decreased costs made its way back to the public authorities that saved them. As is always the case, this House is turning this into a very ideological debate, but it is actually quite technical. Transaction costs existed before; they have been reduced. Today, we are proposing that they be increased again in order for public authorities to benefit from these technical improvements and not just private actors. Naturally, the issue of whether the European Union can take this step forward on its own is being raised. It is clear to everyone that it would be better if this were done within an international framework. If others – specifically, the United States – do not follow our lead, the following question arises: is the European Union’s prospect of achieving this then ruled out? Some statements – for example, that of Mr Gauzès – suggest that the Group of the European People’s Party believes that Europe can do nothing on its own. That situation would not, of course, be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent. Does that, however, mean that the European Union should necessarily position itself at the lowest common denominator, that it should have the least possible regulation, and align itself with the least ambitious actor? That does not seem to us to be the sort of thing that will strengthen the European Union’s position of leadership in the world. Furthermore, it is possible to imagine the European Union putting this transaction in place on its own. This is quite simply because the capital flows that concern us start out in the European Union, then may move elsewhere, only to return to the European Union. When these flows leave and return, we have the opportunity to demand that they can be traced, and to know whether or not they have been subject to this tax on financial transactions. If they have, no problem. If they have not, then we can deduct an entry or exit tax. We have done so for years in the real economy with the Common External Tariff. Financial globalisation is now obliging us to do so in the financial sphere of the economy, and it is entirely possible from a technical point of view. What is needed is the political will. Pascal Canfin,

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to tell the Spanish Presidency that we fully support its analysis of the political will to progress towards new tools of governance and towards an economic union, and not just a monetary union, as Mr Bullmann also pointed out. You will have our political group’s full support in this undertaking. In actual fact, leaving aside the Greek case, which is at stake, I believe that we need to review all the tools of economic governance of the euro area and, in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact. More than half of the Member States in the euro area no longer adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, let us not forget that, until fairly recently – until the crisis – Spain was fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, but that did not stop it, two years later, from finding itself in a radically different situation, with a 20% unemployment rate, or from completely disregarding those criteria. What does this mean? It means that, with a Stability and Growth Pact that is narrowly focused on public finance criteria, which are absolutely necessary but insufficient, until recently, Spain controlled its public debt and its public deficit but, at the same time, allowed its private debt to soar. There has been an explosion in private debt, a speculative bubble on the property market, and a recession on a much greater scale than elsewhere, with the result that a massive injection of public money is required. This is indeed proof that, by having a blinkered view of the Stability and Growth Pact and a view of euro area governance that is focused solely on public debt, one fails to see the bigger picture, which would make it possible to anticipate the next crisis and to prevent it. I should therefore like to know what proposals both the Spanish Presidency and the Commission have put on the table in order, of course, to reaffirm the Stability and Growth Pact and, above all, to integrate it into a more comprehensive system. Secondly, you say – and you are right – that public finances need to be controlled better, that a return to more stable debt levels is necessary. In your view, does that depend solely on a decrease in public spending, or does it also depend on the ability to increase certain taxes? If so, which ones? Also, what role can fiscal cooperation between ourselves play in enabling the Member States to regain some room for manoeuvre that will allow them to make up their deficits, not only by reducing expenditure, but also by regaining some room for manoeuvre so as to increase their revenues? Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, in her speech, Mrs Malmström said that action was needed, not just fine words. I can tell you that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will follow the results of this summit between the United States and the European Union very closely, since it comes at a key moment in the path leading us, on the one hand, to Copenhagen and, on the other, to the reform of the international financial system. On this last point, the casino has now reopened, banks’ profits are once again reaching historic levels – USD 437 billion in profits for the US banks – and our view is that there is less political will than there was six months ago. We therefore have enormous expectations of this summit, which is intended to show that, in both the US and Europe, the political will to regulate capitalism and to regulate the financial institutions is still present. In order to achieve this, we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points. The first is combating tax havens, and this is something that was not mentioned in your speeches. The US Treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of USD 100 billion. We therefore wanted to emphasise this point and to tell you that it is important for the United States and Europe to work jointly on this issue at the summit. The second point, which has just been mentioned, is the tax on financial transactions. When Mr Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency, he expressly said that he was in favour of such a tax. A fortnight ago, the European Parliament for the first time voted, by a majority, for a tax on financial transactions, provided that they formed part of an international framework. The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States/European Union Summit in early November. My last point is that on climate, we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr Obama’s foot. President Obama wants to act, but he is blocked by his majority. The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking, at the end of October, to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30% reduction in its own emissions. Once this is done, we will be able to make progress in negotiations. This is our responsibility. We must do it before the summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
),

− The Verts/ALE Group voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 for several reasons, among which: – by referring to the need to develop new indicators which go beyond GDP, the EP gives a clear signal that ‘economic recovery’ must not be based on a ‘business as usual approach’, which is in line with our request to develop a ‘Green New Deal’; – the resolution insists on the need to tackle global imbalances, especially exchange rate imbalances and commodity price volatility within a multilateral framework; – the resolution sends a good signal towards the setting-up of a tax on financial transactions, which was never the case until now; – as regards the financial crisis, the EP makes a strong statement on international coordination that should aim to avoid regulatory arbitrage. It also stresses that the upgrading of prudential rules within the context of the G20 consists of a ‘minimum harmonisation’ approach that must not prevent the EU from applying higher standards; – as regards supervision of the financial sectors, the EP has made a significant move towards an enhanced and more centralised approach on financial market supervision, with the setting up of a single financial supervisory authority being a final objective.

Mr President, you spoke of the governance of the IMF. I would also like to know if you intend to raise the issue, at the G20, of the conditionality of the money that the IMF lends to states. We have seen that what were previously very liberal conditions have not been changed, and this applies in particular to the loans that were granted to some European States. What is your position on this? My second question is: what is the position of the Commission and the Council on the Chinese proposal to put in place a slightly different international currency, in an effort to regulate the financial system using an alternative to the dollar? My third question is: the G20 is also part of the preparations for Copenhagen. The Commission has proposed a total sum of between EUR 2 and 15 billion to help the countries of the South adapt to climate change. What is the Council’s position? What sum will you put on the table at the G20 next week? Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I have a question for my colleagues about the Polish demand, because I get the impression that this debate is becoming nationalised and that by authorising shale gas exploitation in Poland we are trying to give it European legitimacy. As regards potential, what do you have to say about the figures and the potential that were announced and then the subsequent discovery that there is seven times less potential for exploiting and exploring shale gas in Poland? What do you have to say about subsidiarity, seeing as you are invoking the principle? Does Poland intend to apply subsidiarity to environmental regulations? As it stands today, this falls under European jurisdiction and no country may decide not to apply the regulations. Finally, on the question of acceptance, what answer would you give to the European public, especially those who have lodged complaints with the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions?

 Mr President, My question is very short and simple.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go on creating Europe without its citizens. The year 2013 will be the European Year of Citizens. This is good news. There is a lot at stake here, and we shall have to give ourselves the resources to enable us, in the difficult situation which the European Union is experiencing, faced with disaffection and lack of confidence, to turn the European Year of Citizens into Year One of European citizenship in everyday life. Our citizens are the reason for our presence here, and we must send them the message that Parliament and the European Union do not take citizens’ rights lightly, that they are at the heart of all the decisions that we take on a day-to-day basis. We need a campaign which matches the level of what is at stake. Savings in the budget must not be made on this aspect if we do not want the gulf between the Union and its citizens to become even wider. The action programme will have to be ambitious. The tools of participative democracy must be developed and distributed: petitions, access to the Ombudsman, European citizens’ initiatives, citizens’ forums, consultations, etc. I am sorry to say that our citizens fail to appreciate the rights and tools of participative democracy. In 2013, let us put our citizens back into the heart of our institutions and, in so doing, put Europe back into the heart of its Member States. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just got back from Hyderabad, in India, and the Eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity. Parliament was represented there alongside the Commission and the Council. The task facing this summit was an important one: to decide on financing for the biodiversity rescue plan 2010-2020 [sic
: 2011-2020], adopted two years ago at Nagoya. It was a close-run thing; the talks were difficult, but definite progress was made on maritime and coastal waters, and a commitment was secured to double the funding for biodiversity by 2015. After the disappointment of the Rio Summit, this comes as a relief. The European Union and the international community are still capable of imposing their will when it comes to the environment. But the critical state of biodiversity requires us to intensify our efforts and deliver on our commitments to preserve our natural world, here and now, in the budget, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. And soon we shall be debating measures against biopiracy and ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. I urge you to show a solid front and prove, once again, that the European Parliament seeks and feels a responsibility for biojustice at European and world level. Sandrine Bélier,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to say how delighted I am that we are having this discussion in this House just a few days after the Earth summit, which, as we have already heard, a number of you attended. It is time, I believe, to take stock and, most of all, to look forward. Taking stock is a simple matter: the results of this summit are disappointing. Forty years after the first Earth summit and 20 years after the commitments made in Rio, while we were expecting renewed impetus, a leap forward, the leaders of the international community were treading water. As to the future we want, the promise has not been kept and the commitments have been carried forward to 2015. The European Union set off for Rio with the ambition of sharing an action programme and we are returning with a work programme. Today, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, as well as the Member States, for the determination they have shown in the negotiations, and for embodying Europe’s ambitions in terms of the ecological transition of our economy, which we defined in this Parliament. Where do we go from here? Now, more than ever before, I am aware of the responsibility resting on our shoulders and the role that the European Union can play in promoting a new model of development to help us recover from the crisis. In Rio, we failed to set an example, and we did not provide any evidence that we were applying and following through with our ambitions in terms of sustainable development in all our European policies. What we now have to do is activate the transition at European level and at the level of the Member States. Without further ado, let us introduce innovative financing and implement the financial transaction tax and the environmental tax. Without further ado, let us initiate our energy transition so as to put an end to fossil fuels. Let us commit to the conservation of our marine and terrestrial resources. Let us get on with it! This will strengthen the credibility of the European Union and give it greater international weight. It will also enhance the prospects of the international human community for a better future. Let us resolutely commit ourselves, once again, right here and now, to the work programme adopted in Rio to accelerate change. Above all, let us also reaffirm our ambitions and try to make headway in the next two meetings in 2012: on biodiversity in Hyderabad and on climate in Doha. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, our Parliament will vote on the ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). It is because this treaty is a threat to public and digital liberties and to fundamental rights (freedom of expression, protection of personal data and private life), but also because it will lead to unacceptable restrictions in terms of information sharing in the fields of culture, agriculture, health and innovation to the benefit of certain groups, that we must reject ACTA. After three years of political and technical sparring, will our Parliament, the one and only direct representative of the European citizens, live up to the expectations and the trust of the thousands of citizens who have protested on the streets of Europe and inundated us with e-mails, the three million Europeans who have appealed to our Committee on Petitions, the citizens who elected us? Yes, by voting against ACTA and in favour of freedoms. Tomorrow, it is the citizens’ lobby which must win in order to say ‘Bye bye ACTA, welcome democracy!’. Welcome European democracy and citizens’ democracy. Welcome to the 21st century and the digital age. Our choice, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is political, and it is a rejection of the world proposed to us by ACTA. Sandrine Bélier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Seeber. This report provides a clear overview of the issues surrounding implementation of water legislation, in particular, and also gives a very good insight into possible solutions, especially in terms of more widely applicable, cohesive policies for this vital resource and its preservation. Among the report’s positive elements, and one that we must address as a matter of urgency, is its reaffirmation that water is a shared resource of humankind and that an integrated approach is needed. It also emphasises the duty of moderation of all sectors and all users in every EU country in their use of water, and calls once again for an objective assessment and urgent review – and perhaps even the phasing out – of all public subsidies and funding that are harmful to the preservation of water quality. I regret the fact that the report does not place enough emphasis on the urgency of reducing urban, industrial and agricultural diffuse pollution by all possible means. We still need to make a greater commitment to protecting aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, through regulatory oversight of our soils, among other things, so that eventually, we will achieve ‘good status’ throughout the European Union, as unfortunately, this will not be achieved by 2015. We have tools that we must develop and harmonise, but above all, we have objectives that we must meet without delay. All we need to do now is to put them into practice. We are counting on the European Commission to make sure this happens. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work. This report proposes a new strategy to 2020 to combat biodiversity loss, the pace of which, as has been pointed out, is continuing to accelerate dangerously. It aims to remind us of the extent to which our systems and our future are intimately linked to the conservation of our natural and genetic capital – for our food, our health and the fight against climate change – and it highlights the extent to which our future economic development is linked to our ability to conserve biodiversity. Let us remind ourselves that, each year, we are losing 3% of global GDP due to biodiversity loss, that the costs of inaction are far higher than the necessary investment costs and are not simply financial and that urgent measures are needed before the cost becomes too high and the loan taken out can no longer be repaid. Our report calls for two immediate measures: the development of innovative financial mechanisms and the elimination of all environmentally harmful public subsidies. However, this report also insists on the need to enshrine our development strategies in a medium and long-term vision and to place the challenges of preserving biodiversity at the heart of our sectoral policies and, first and foremost, at the heart of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the forestry policy. If this dimension of integration and ambitious commitments were to disappear from the text during today’s vote, we would be depriving ourselves of one of the main levers for action, and my group would not be able to vote for this report. Furthermore, I call on my conservative colleagues not to reject the unblocking of the framework directive on soil protection. Today, 48% of European soil is heavily degraded. This degradation has a cost estimated by the Commission at just under EUR 40 billion annually. Only ambitious action taken at European level can save us from this infernal spiral of the artificial development and sterilisation of our land. Finally, it is because we need to learn from our past mistakes and look to the future, and beyond Europe, that we have also introduced a reference to the next Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. Meanwhile, this report is one of the key stages of our determination and of the role of the European Union to succeed where yesterday we failed. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have one minute to call your attention to the ACTA treaty, an international anti-counterfeiting treaty which is not limited to counterfeiting. Patents and online activity are clearly included in the text in unacceptable conditions. Last Saturday, tens of thousands of people protested throughout Europe. More than two million citizens signed a petition against the treaty. Several governments are stepping back — Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia — in the name of defending civil rights. Germany has withheld its decision while it waits to hear the European Parliament’s position. Nineteen Sakharov Prize laureates and several NGOs have expressed their opposition. However, the European Commission is turning a blind eye and trying to force the treaty through. Today, I am launching an appeal to the representatives of the European people from all of the parties within this Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are relying on us to ensure the respect and protection of freedom of expression, freedom of information, access to generic medicines, personal data and details about their private lives, all of which are threatened by this treaty. They are relying on us to defend their freedoms and their fundamental rights and to block ACTA, as it has been presented to us in its current state. We must not disappoint them, we must be demanding and say no, vote against ACTA. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, this European Parliament resolution on the neutrality of the Internet shows our capacity to play a concrete role in the transformation from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. Ensuring that fundamental rights are respected in this new economy is crucial from all points of view. We are therefore delighted with the spirit of this resolution, which considers the Internet as a new area of democracy and which points out the importance of ensuring respect for fundamental rights related to or dependent on the web’s neutrality, such as freedom of expression, the protection of private data and media pluralism. It also highlights the importance of ensuring respect for values such as the sharing of and access to knowledge for the greatest number of people and of allowing no exceptions in the application of legal proceedings that enforce the respect of these rights. We hope that this resolution will lead us towards the recognition and enshrinement of the right to Internet access in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Finally, we also hope that this resolution will find support within the Commission and the Council so as to strengthen the European regulatory framework, and in particular, its application in all of the Member States to truly ensure an open and free Internet for every European citizen.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the context in which preparations are taking place for the fourth Earth Summit is difficult. It is incumbent upon us, of course, to tackle the financial and economic crisis in the euro area. However, one crisis does not chase away another and they are often linked. Indeed, the debt crisis does not affect only Greece and European finances. The crisis is not just financial. It is also a social and ecological crisis, which has to be brought to an end. Today, we are running an ecological deficit. We began to eat into our credit forty years ago and the debt has been growing ever since. Inequalities are getting worse, assaults on mother nature are mounting every year, with imbalances in the weather system, deforestation, collapsing fish stocks and loss of biodiversity being the most flagrant signs. There is only one solution for humanity: it must settle its debt. For this to happen, it behoves the policy makers of this world to act in solidarity, now, in 2012, not in 10 years’ time. I believe that the European Union has a crucial role to play and that the fourth Earth Summit in Rio in June 2012 is the ideal framework for making further commitments, for changing our economic development models, and for moving towards a new green economy. Let us say ‘yes’ to an economy that consumes fewer resources, a fairer economy, an economy that is committed to ecological sustainability and social justice; ‘yes’ to new indicators going beyond GDP; ‘yes’ to the principle of bioconditionality; but ‘no’ to the commoditisation and privatisation of common assets; and ‘no’ to the reproduction of the models that have brought us to where we are today. Let us say ‘yes’ to an international status for environmental refugees; ‘yes to greater responsibility, justice and environmental democracy. We, elected representatives, 20 years later, what do we say to Severn Suzuki? What will our response be if another child stands up in Rio in June 2012 and expresses her fear of the future, her inability to understand the inequalities that exist across the world and implores us to act before it is too late? The resolution we will vote on tomorrow is one of the elements of that response. This resolution, as adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is an ambitious, firm and responsible position, and I call on my fellow Members not to weaken it. I call on the Commission and the Council to give it the scope it deserves at the highest level for sustainable development on a global scale. (Applause) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to consider that the exact and original wording of paragraph 35 of the resolution, which is put to the vote and which stresses that corporate social responsibility should include biodiversity, is the French version, and that that should be the version used. Moreover, the word ‘social’, which has disappeared from the English version, should be reinserted and the version corrected. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, you invited us to vote for the original text of paragraph 16. However, there was a separate vote beforehand, and paragraph 16 was amended. There were two separate votes. Therefore, we voted for the original text but not for the amendment. Sandrine Bélier,

Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitments made in 1992 in Rio and in 2002 in Johannesburg have not been respected. Our strategies for halting the loss of biodiversity have been a failure, and we know the reasons for this failure. The climate is changing, biodiversity is diminishing, and humanity must be determined to adapt itself more and more quickly, and in ways which are more and more difficult. In Nagoya, with a few weeks to go before Cancún, the European Union has the opportunity to argue in favour of adapting our economic development model to face up to the challenges of the 21st century. Climate deregulation, halting the loss of biodiversity and combating poverty: these three challenges, and the responses needed to face up to them, are intimately linked. We have the responsibility of proposing and introducing a new development model which is fairer, more equitable and more sustainable. So let us speak clearly and practically. Parliament’s resolution identifies three key challenges which now raise several questions about the Commission’s and the Council’s position. The first challenge, of course, is to start protecting and restoring biodiversity. This presupposes adequate financing, the withdrawal of all public aid which is harmful for biodiversity and a dedicated budget which we propose should be multiplied tenfold. However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same? The second challenge is the cost of biodiversity loss to society, which has only just begun to be evaluated. It is thought to be around 1% of global GDP, but this evaluation does not take into account the social, cultural, moral and scientific value of biodiversity. Is the European Union determined to resist the monetisation of living things? Is it determined to defend the common inheritance of humankind and to reaffirm that nature is priceless and is not for sale? Finally, the third challenge is to stop the pillaging of genetic resources by businesses and industries. One solution is to regulate access to genetic resources in a way which, in particular, respects fully the rights of indigenous and local communities. The European Union will still have a particular responsibility in these negotiations. As such, is it determined, firstly, to defend the principle of the non-patentability of life and, secondly, to support the repayment of the ecological debt to the countries of the South by supporting the retroactivity of the system which is to be adopted? Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been mentioned, it is the International Year of Biodiversity and, this year, we are being asked to commit ourselves to resolving a triple crisis. The three interconnected elements require a consistent and integrated approach if we are to tackle them and emerge from an ecological crisis that has direct repercussions for our economy and our social model. This triple crisis involves food security, climate change and loss of biodiversity. I should like to remind you that biodiversity has no price attached, but its loss, its decline and its destruction do have a cost which contributes to the increase in poverty and which engenders inequalities and considerable losses in economic, welfare and cultural terms. As has already been mentioned – and we now know it for sure – 40% of our world economy depends directly on services provided by nature, and 60% of these are in sharp decline. Europe has lost 30% of its biodiversity over the past 40 years. This loss is currently valued at 1% of the EU’s GDP – EUR 50 billion per year – and it might reach EUR 14 000 billion in 2050 if we do not take action, since the decline is accelerating and the causes of the failure of previous EU policies in this area are well known and are clearly set out in the report. The measures to be taken are also set out in the report. We are therefore hoping for a large vote in its favour, and we should like to thank Mrs de Lange for her work. We now have to move from words and intentions to deeds; from objectives to means. I find it difficult to hide several regrets: the lack of responsiveness on the part of the Council and of the Commission despite the need for urgent action; the regret that Soil Directive IV is still being blocked by the Council; the regret that bio-conditionality of all public financing was rejected by just one vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; and the regret that the challenges associated with biodiversity have not been more extensively incorporated in the EU 2020 strategy, so as to ensure a sustainable exit from the crisis through the greening of our economic model. There is a need for consistency. There is still time to understand and to commit ourselves to ensuring that our natural capital is preserved and enhanced. This is a winning investment for the future.

Madam President, France is the only Member State that did not anticipate the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and that is refusing to abide by the outcome of the European elections of June 2009. By accepting the third option – the French exception – of appointing two new MEPs, we are being asked to endorse a serious violation of the Union’s primary legislation: the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, from which we have derived our legitimacy for 31 years. Are we going to abide by the Council’s decision, under pressure from one Member State, which shows a certain lack of regard for the Union and the European citizens? Our Parliament must not sanction this serious breach of the principle of European democracy. We must refuse to undermine our legitimacy and our credibility as elected representatives of the European public. It is the European citizens who choose who they want to represent them in the European Parliament, not the governments of the Member States. This French exception justifies our demand for Parliament to be involved, in the case of a convention on the revision of the Treaties, and to reject any intergovernmental conference.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you touched on the subject of storm Xynthia, which has just struck Western Europe causing the deaths of almost 60 people and considerable material damage. I am extremely sad today, but also angry because this human catastrophe could have been avoided; at the least, its impacts could have been limited. Until recently in France and throughout Europe today, coastal areas and flood zones are being developed in spite of and in violation of current European, and indeed national, legislation. These are often Natura 2000 sites, and their protection from urbanisation is essential to limit the effects of similar natural events. It is up to us to demonstrate greater accountability, to make sure that Community regulations – in particular, the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive – are strictly applied by Member States, and to make the Structural Funds conditional on the requirements of sustainability, safety and biodiversity. The EU 2020 strategy is a unique opportunity to redefine our relationship with the environment. (The President cut off the speaker) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

I am sorry, Mr President. This is my first time, I checked that the procedure was correct and meanwhile … please accept my apologies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the year that the UN has declared the ‘International Year of Biodiversity’, I would like to draw your attention to the failure of the 2004-2010 European Strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity. 40% of our natural heritage is under threat. The state of biodiversity is a measure of the state of health of the planet, of the state of health of our development system, and the crisis phenomenon is accelerating. Therefore, I hope that, today and tomorrow, the European Union and the European Parliament will be able to rise to the challenges and come up with ambitious and wide-ranging objectives to halt the loss of biodiversity in all sectoral policies in 2010. We must act, there is still time, and 2010 is a year in which anything is possible. I hope we will be able to do better than we did in Copenhagen. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 November, Parliament was given the Council’s guarantee that any restrictions on internet access can only be made if certain conditions are met: prior, fair and impartial procedure; a guarantee of the principle of presumption of innocence and the respect for privacy; and respect for the European Convention on Human Rights. This agreement is the first step towards better protection for citizens faced with growing attempts made by certain States and private operators to trivialise the principle of flexible response, data storage and the control of digital exchange on the internet. That, however, is not enough. Accepting restrictions on digital freedoms and going against net neutrality is not acceptable. It is contrary to the Lisbon Strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the Union. As the sole directly elected European institution, in order to protect citizens’ interests, Parliament now has the moral and political duty to take up this issue and define the rights and duties of internet users so as to guarantee their digital freedom and access to knowledge. We will vote in favour of this text, but we will make sure that we take the matter further tomorrow. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot address the Presidency, since it is not here. We spend our time, in our constituencies and our countries, defending Europe, saying: ‘There will be no way out of the crisis without Europe!’. Europe is complicated: it is made up of 27 states, soon to be 28, and it is always extremely difficult to come to and implement European decisions quickly. Forgive me, Commissioner, but when I listen to you, I think: ‘I hope workers in the photovoltaic sector are not watching the video of your speech!’, because they are going to say to themselves: ‘Is this the Europe that is supposed to be protecting me?’. For years, we have been told that the fight against climate change, renewable energy objectives, green industry and the green economy would be pillars of European growth and the European economy. Today, what are we seeing? We are seeing European institutions that are, in part, petrified by China, and which are taking months and months to potentially react or take provisional measures. How can we justify to these workers, and to all those who are fighting for Europe to protect industry and protect workers, the fact that the United States have, in the space of a few weeks, taken strong measures, imposing import tariffs of up to 250 %, while in Europe, we finally got around to opening an investigation in September and may have provisional measures by July, or failing that, by the end of the year? It is true that First Solar
 has already closed its sites in Germany; it is true that the news about Q Cells
 is now history. How many small and medium-sized enterprises are in difficulty today, however? Even if they do not make it into the news, they are in difficulty. Thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs are under threat. So, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee, we urge you to accelerate the process of introducing provisional measures. Europe was a leader, with ambitious goals on renewable energy and a strong renewable energy industry working alongside it. Today, we are losing that industry, while a real trade war is taking place between the United States and China in the strategic sector of renewable energy, which is so crucial to our competitiveness and our future energy policy. It seems that today, the European Union has once again opted to wait indefinitely. At this rate, the decision will be taken by default. When there is no European photovoltaic industry left, there will no longer be any point in taking measures: you will be able to rest at ease!

 Thank you, Mr Caspary, for your question, which gives me the opportunity to continue to elaborate on this subject. I find it extremely compelling that the entire Committee on International Trade – which is hardly known for its protectionism – is, through this probing oral question, calling on the Commission to go faster. It is not entirely insignificant that it should be a German coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and a German coordinator of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who are now saying that measures must be taken, while Germany has regularly said: ‘Let us avoid any problems with China, let us avoid any trade war with China!’. The European Parliament is therefore united, Commissioner, in calling on you to accelerate the procedures. We must save these jobs. We must do as China and the United States have done and finally endow ourselves with an industrial policy that defends itself through trade instruments. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, if the world warmed by 4°C we would see a torrent of disasters, including extreme heat waves, a reduction in food stocks and a rise in sea level, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Those words are not taken from the Doha briefing brochure of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, as you know, from the World Bank report, which also states that the fight against global warming is an economic opportunity. However, it seems that the international negotiations are not making any headway and are waiting for 2015. We must obviously avoid what led to the Copenhagen failure: trying to reach an agreement right before the end of Copenhagen and not preparing it adequately beforehand. Doha is an extremely important meeting. It seems that conservatism of all kinds is taking precedence over the urgency and the new economy, especially this new carbon-free economy, so the European Union needs to set an example. Here, once again, the Union seems to be dragging its feet: when it comes to aviation, climate change caused by agrofuels, the restriction on the coal market and ‘hot air’, the European Union’s most recent decisions have been bad decisions. We know that you are ambitious, Commissioner. We need to be ambitious in Doha and we need to continue to try to convince your colleagues in the Commission and us in the European Parliament to ensure that Europe continues to lead the way.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we sometimes see astonishing things in this Parliament. When we talk about human rights in China, we hear people say: ‘we need to do business with China because that will encourage respect for human rights in China’. When revolutions happen in Arab countries, we hear people say: ‘we must organise free trade agreements with the Arab countries because that is how we can support the emergence of democracy in the Arab countries’. All of a sudden, trade becomes a purely technical, and highly complicated, issue that has no connection with politics. We know, unfortunately, that this agreement does not guarantee the origin of the products that will enter the European market: firstly, pharmaceutical products and then other industrial products. Not even a week ago, Mr Netanyahu’s Government announced the legalisation of unauthorised settlements and the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank, and all this with an eye on the election on 22 January. At a time when Europe is going to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of its past and, above all, the history it must build, particularly with its neighbours, it would be an aberration for Europe to send out a message that it is upgrading its political relations with Israel, rewarding the Netanyahu Administration for all of its politics, which are constantly criticised by the EU bodies, especially Baroness Ashton. What we are doing here is sending a message to Israel: ‘you must vote for Mr Netanyahu so that he continues his settlement policy, his policy of infringing human rights’. We are in favour of referring the report back to committee for all of the reasons that Mr Moreira gave. It is crucial that Europe does not get involved in the Israeli elections and does not send a message of support to Mr Netanyahu.

As you know, it is extremely difficult to trace the origin of all of the products that come from Israel. Therefore, even if there is no definitive proof today that pharmaceutical products are produced in certain territories, that does not mean that that will be the case in the future, especially when there is a desire to expand the settlements and there may be other industrial products that would not offer a guarantee that they are not manufactured in the Occupied Territories. Sir, do not hesitate to look at the voting list of the Greens for every vote we hold on trade agreements: you will see that we are consistent with regard to respect for human rights, the environment and social rights.

 Mr President, tomorrow, Parliament should reject the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). This is good news for democracy, because it sanctions a negotiation process which has chosen confidentiality and opacity over transparency and the involvement of Parliament. I know that it is not your fault, Commissioner. This is good news for democracy, because Parliament will choose culture, agriculture, health and communication over large industrial groups. I am shocked to hear that certain Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believe that the general interest is that of large industrial groups and not that of citizens when they become involved in a social issue. This is good news for democracy, because millions of citizens have taken to the streets and have held a large-scale social debate, and I am happy that some MEPs in this Chamber have changed their minds in favour of democracy. Lastly, this is good news for democracy, because we will finally have, within our European societies, a debate on the balance between public freedom and information sharing, on the one hand, and fair remuneration for creativity and innovation, on the other.

Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that someone is taking notes for the Danish Presidency. We also share the positive view on this resolution. It is extremely important for us that the Council be able to hear the voice of Parliament on the mandate. I believe that the institutional agreement framework is clear. It is not a binding opinion but, in view of both the economic and social crises, and the trade deficits that we have in Europe, it is absolutely essential to get trade agreements and the content of the negotiations right. For that reason, should it happen, for once, that the Council listens to what Parliament has to say before establishing the negotiating mandate, I think that we could take a step forward in terms of the quality of the agreements that we can approve. I think that recent experience, including the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), shows that from a policy standpoint, it would be wise to listen to what Parliament has to say before entering into negotiations. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is not a question of obtaining, pre-negotiation, concessions from the Japanese, as certain groups understand it. We are simply saying: let us have a transparent negotiation process that is clear, and thereby not enter into several negotiation processes at the same time. Let us have a clear mandate with which we can start negotiations. That also raises some questions. Conducting negotiations with Japan and with the United States also raises some questions. In our Committee on International Trade, we have, on several occasions, had discussions with Pascal Lamy and today this process marks a break. Entering into negotiations with a large trade bloc such as Japan or the United States marks a break in the European position and, as such, puts to one side, or takes note of, the failed negotiations that took place in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must take greater consideration of the consequences of these negotiations, in particular, when they primarily concern the regulatory system, investments, public markets, and all of the regulatory frameworks rather than tariffs. We must consider what bilateral negotiations signify as opposed to multilateral negotiations. Then, Commissioner, you said that 90%, I believe, of the growth – this is your figure – will take place outside of Europe. I am not sure that Japan is the most dynamic area right now, but to benefit further from this international growth means being able to sell, which entails having a strategic vision of our economy and our industrial sector. Once again, I regret the fact that we have some 20 trade negotiations ongoing around the world without having an industrial policy, without knowing what we want for our economy, for example, for our automotive industry over the next 20 years.

 I have a quick question for Mr Caspary: is it already the case that despite the conditions that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) imposed with regard to concluding an agreement, it has already voted against a free trade agreement? Now a subsidiary question: does Mr Caspary recall a single impact assessment concerning the implementation of a free trade agreement which can confirm all the benefits which were announced when the free trade agreement was negotiated, be they social or economic benefits? Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, it goes without saying that failing to comply with social and environmental standards and human rights also creates an imbalance between the EU and China. However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States. Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries. Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy. In Europe, we try to have both targets for renewable energy and, until recently, a renewable energy industry. China has launched a price war on renewable energy and, in particular, photovoltaics. Through subsidies, it has developed production overcapacity that is killing off the European photovoltaic industry. This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not? Thousands of jobs are currently being lost, which is why we call on the European Commission to come back to Parliament with an analysis of China’s strategy in the photovoltaic market and whether the US response is the right way to go. We clearly want to be thinking along these lines. We cannot be defending our targets for renewable energy without defending the European renewable energy industry. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, you mentioned the European legislation on CO2 
emissions from cars. This was already one of the Commission’s initiatives in 1995. Yet, faced with the lobby by large car manufacturers, what should have been achieved in 2005 will not be achieved until 2015. I would like it if, at some point, democracy were allowed to function and citizens were able to see the transparency of what is being debated in Parliament, because those on the conservative benches who claim to protect the citizens are today abandoning them in the face of rocketing fuel bills. They are abandoning the workers in the face of the relocation of an industry that has failed to innovate and that has left our territories. They are abandoning the citizens of the whole world in the face of climate change. Yes, we find ourselves in a complicated situation. We are facing a twofold problem. Firstly, we have governments that seem incapable of changing their software, incapable of imagining an economic model that is anything other than household debt, State debt or climate debt. Then, we are seeing lobbies in this situation that are stepping into the breach of this conservatism. Nuclear energy, carbon sequestration, oil sands and shale gas lobbyists are trying to take advantage of this political indecision. Ms Hedegaard, your Roadmap is not perfect, Mr Davies’ report is not perfect, but it would be irresponsible of Parliament to validate the complete irresponsibility of Poland.

 Mr Helmer, could you confirm that in Great Britain, EDF, E.ON and RWE are in the process of negotiating a feed-in tariff for nuclear energy of nine to 12 cents per kWh, a price that is currently higher than that of onshore wind energy, which is seven cents per kWh? Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you; you managed to avert disaster in Durban. You managed to put across the idea that there is a suitable framework for negotiations but, on the other hand, nothing has actually been triggered to stem climate change. With the notable exception of Poland, you gained the support of Member States to champion these negotiations but you know, unfortunately, you do not have the same consensus from Member States to implement an ambitious climate policy. What I propose, Commissioner, is that DG CLIMA, which you run, makes its contribution to getting Europe out of the crisis, by explaining how an ambitious climate policy could significantly help us get out of the crisis through energy efficiency, through energy savings, through renewable energy, through innovation in technology. Maybe then we would have a document which would allow us to fight – us in the Member States, you at European level –so that the old economy loosens its grip on our political leaders and the new economy may finally emerge.

 Madam President, Commissioner, some of us were in Doha when we launched the Doha Round. We are well aware that the Round was, in a way, stillborn: it had so many contradictions in its genes that it could not succeed, but it was the international situation – it was just after 11 September – that ultimately forced all the countries to sign in Doha. What we are seeing above all today is not a crisis of confidence within the international community, but a crisis of globalisation. We need to stop thinking about ever more liberalisation and focus instead, of course, on regulation, in a world in which every one of us today can see the damage caused by the globalisation of trade, whether it be from an environmental point of view or from a social point of view. What kind of economy does Europe want to create for itself? How can we put a stop to environmental, social, fiscal and monetary dumping? How can we ensure that people can exercise their trade union freedom throughout the world without restriction? How can Europe make global trade dependent on the recognition and exercise of trade union freedom? These are the questions that we need to be asking ourselves today, that Europe needs to ask itself when it operates within a multilateral framework. We must acknowledge that the Doha Round is finished, adopt a package that is limited and restricted to the least developed countries and, above all, launch an ambitious and transparent process for reforming the World Trade Organisation, one that guarantees the fair participation of all stakeholders and safeguards the interests of the weakest countries in particular, that makes trade law subject to social legislation, environmental law and, of course, human rights, and that actually promotes a multilateral regulatory agenda that puts globalisation back where it belongs.

Madam President, Commissioner, you are not being attacked personally in this matter, Commissioner, but you must understand that we are extremely disappointed that the Commission has given in so easily to pressure from some Member States, and France in particular. So we do indeed want to phase out nuclear power because we believe that this is the only way to eliminate the nuclear risk. In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years. We want to have real tests, and we cannot accept the fact that France has been successful in allowing the risky option to go forward. The tests do not predict airplane crashes, either over fuel ponds or over reactors. Neither do they predict terrorist attacks. We refuse to accept the fact that the tests applied at European level have become a communications exercise by a crisis unit for the nuclear industry, which Mr Sarkozy will showcase at the next G8 in order to sell even more European pressurised water reactors (PWRs). That is what we cannot accept, Commissioner. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Indeed, Mr Liese, this resolution was co-signed, and I would also like to respond to Mrs del Castillo Vera who said that the French public is in favour of nuclear energy. That is not true.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact the first major Free Trade Agreement that Europe has passed for some years, and when it comes to free trade agreements, it must be said that you do not lack ambition – South Korea, Canada, India, Mercosur. There is not a single country or area that escapes the European Commission’s ambitions where free trade agreements are concerned. In the case of this agreement, we have seen that there will only be winners, but I still wonder who the winners will be when I am told that they will be in the agricultural sector. As the elected representative of Brittany, I can tell you that in in that region which produces more than 60% of French pigmeat, the few benefits to be had by the agri-food product firms do not compensate for reductions in tourism, degradation of the environment and the health of workers, and farmers’ losses. There are, indeed, also a great number of losers, and do we, here, have a vision of what economic and social Europe will be like after all these free trade agreements have been signed? No we do not, and nor do we know, at the end of the day, whether there will be any industrial or economic sector left to benefit from these free trade agreements. Moreover, and most importantly, Commissioner, try as you might to tell us that we are not questioning South Korea’s environmental and climate policy, that is not true. We are going to be able to export enormous saloon cars, those cars of which the manufacturers who make the least amount of effort to combat climate change are rewarded by this agreement. For the first time, the European Union is questioning the climate policy of one of its trading partners. Has the European Commission started to change, under pressure from Canada, its directive on fuel quality? We believe that we are putting Europe’s ambitions in the wrong order: the environment and the climate must come before trade. That is why our group will vote against this agreement. Yannick Jadot,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at this early stage, to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue, which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements. The subject is an important one. As you all know, the forest is receding. Every two seconds, across the world, the equivalent of a football pitch is destroyed; within a year, an area the size of Greece is deforested. Clearly, this is a tragic situation. It is tragic from the point of view of diversity: a few thousand plant and animal species are threatened, and the forests which are most affected – tropical forests – contain half of the world’s biodiversity. It is obviously tragic, too, from the point of view of climate change: deforestation is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, deforestation puts some hundreds of millions of people in danger – people who either live in the forests or live off them. Forest exploitation and the forestry industry are among the principal causes of deforestation, particularly in the area on which we are focusing today: the Congo basin. It is estimated that 20 to 40% of the timber felled and exchanged in the world is illegal timber. The issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one. These voluntary partnership agreements have been approved in the context of the approval procedure within the Committee on International Trade. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this procedure allows the European Parliament to express its view. At the same time, however, it can only say yes or no. Hence, this debate is extremely important because it allows us to go into more detail, and it allows you, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, to respond to the questions that Parliament is putting to you. These agreements are important; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber. They also put in place independent verification procedures, and supplement forest policies and governance in the countries concerned. Today, we are talking about the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. However, I would like to make an initial point before going into these agreements and Parliament’s questions: we really must differentiate between legal timber and sustainable timber. Obviously, we are dealing with the legality of timber here, but legal timber does not necessarily mean sustainable forest exploitation. Therefore, the first general question that I would ask the Commission is: how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests – 2011 is the International Year of Forests – while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún, in particular, on the REDD+ mechanism, and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated, which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber? Next, we are still waiting for an answer from the European Commission on the question of biofuels and indirect changes in land use. As you know, Parliament has asked you to integrate these issues into the criteria for evaluating the sustainability of biofuels. More specifically, concerning the voluntary partnership agreements, there are many positive elements: we greatly appreciated the negotiation efforts and, in particular, the involvement of members of civil society in Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. We know that it is not easy and, from this point of view, these voluntary partnership agreements seemed to be a success. As I was saying just now, however, a number of questions and requests remain. Commissioner, are you ready to come, for example, every six months, or six months after the signing of an agreement, to update us on the implementation of the agreement? I ask because it is clear that the negotiation and the implementation of the agreement may be of a very different quality. We would therefore like you to come and tell us if the parties concerned, in particular, the members of civil society, continue to be involved in its implementation. In countries in which it is still not easy to complain, particularly when corruption exists, have complaint mechanisms been provided for – in particular, independent ones – so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to? In the same way, we would like you to regularly report on the impacts of the implementation of these agreements, so that you can tell us where we have got to with them, both in terms of the overall consistency of the Commission’s actions on forests, and in terms of their specific implementation on the issue of the legality of timber. Lastly, a final point: you claim that there is no budget in these agreements. Yet we will obviously need budgets to support these policies, so can you clarify the budgetary issue in relation to these voluntary partnership agreements? Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, once again, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. I believe that we have almost all spoken in the same terms: making this essential point about VPAs, which provide the link between development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society. I believe that, if there is one tool that we can use today to bring about sustainable development in these countries, particularly the African countries, it is undoubtedly the strengthening of civil society. As long as the only or the main expression of democracy in those countries is the vote to elect the President, then as we have seen – as the history of Côte d’Ivoire unfortunately reminds us – we will not make sufficient progress. Therefore, strengthening civil society – the fact that it plays a constant role in the implementation of these agreements, in the monitoring of forest exploitation, in the discussion on the conditions of this exploitation and in the sharing of revenues linked to this forest exploitation – is essential. It is through this strengthening of civil society, too, that we will respond best to the argument that we often hear concerning China: ‘Why should we meet the criteria for strong cooperation with Europe – social, democratic and environmental criteria – when China makes a mockery of them in terms of corruption and pillaging?’ Well, strengthening civil society is the best defence against this system which China, in particular, is trying to impose on the countries of the South. Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also – and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry – a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries. Thank you for your desire to work with the European Parliament. We are very happy about this future collaboration. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, like Mr Leinen, I wanted to emphasise the remarkable work that Commissioner Hedegaard and her team carried out in Cancún. Today, in a way, the success of Cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that, if the others take no action, we will take no action. The positive aspect of Cancún is that everyone must now engage with the machine of international negotiation, in particular, by strengthening their national or regional objectives. In terms of the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Europe now has to reach 30%. Reaching 30% is part of the objective of obtaining a decarbonised economy by 2050; 20% will not allow us to make this transition. Finally, in reaching 30%, we will also clearly be linking up now with the emerging economies: Brazil, China and South Africa. We know that these countries have some objectives which, up to a point, are currently superior to those of the European Union. We must therefore put a stop to inaction and the strategy of the status quo. The success of Cancún means that we must engage with the process of international negotiation in a much more constructive manner. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and, in principle, clearly, to support the adoption tomorrow of the report adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Let us come now to the unbelievable potential associated with energy savings, a point that has been made here. Reports from the European Commission itself say that if we called a halt to our excessive energy consumption, if we reduced our energy wastage by 20%, we could create one million jobs, we could save almost EUR 1 000 per European household, and we could clearly reduce our external energy bill. A 20% energy saving or reduction in Europe is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos in energy terms, and we are currently missing that target. Mrs Hall made this point, and the way I see it, we have trouble calculating. If reports show today that we are far from achieving 20%, then we can evaluate the savings that we make or do not make each year. We also know that this eco-design or eco-labelling approach for cars and so on does not result in overall coherence and does enable us to obtain the results that we are seeking. I am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here. Excuse me, Commissioner, but when you say that we have a problem in defining energy efficiency, this is perhaps true from a theoretical point of view, but the climate and energy package is very clear on the objective. It says that energy consumption must be reduced by 20% below the baseline level. This problem does not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency. There are energy levels that we need to return to – that is what the climate and energy package says. We are told that we do not need a binding objective. We are thus making one on renewables. A few days ago, in Cancún, the European Commission negotiated a binding agreement on climate change and tried to defend the Kyoto Protocol, and in this House we are citing the arguments of the United States and China by saying: ‘We will go for voluntary targets, and then, if one day we realise that they are not working, we will create binding targets’. With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building. There is scope to take a large-scale European initiative on building, which nevertheless accounts for 40% of our energy consumption; we can go much further on renovation. Finally, citizens are today facing the cold. They are paying very high prices for their energy. If Europe emerges from the crisis, energy will be much more expensive internationally. Citizens will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy prices. We must move much more quickly, and I would also ask you, Commissioner, to please stress to Mr Van Rompuy that the 4 February meeting should also be a meeting about energy consumption. From this point of view, the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, we propose changing the end of paragraph 22 by replacing ‘prevent’ with ‘inform’, so the final phrase becomes:  ‘reiterates also Parliament’s request to the Commission and Member States to inform the European Parliament about loans granted by export credit agencies and the European Investment Bank to projects that have a negative impact on the climate’. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could have limited my speech to simply recalling the images of this summer in Russia or southern Asia, to reminding you of the absolutely urgent need to combat climate change and, since we are talking about Europe, to move immediately, or as soon as we possibly can, to a target of 30% by 2020 for greenhouse gas emissions. Today, if we make no changes, we shall reach 19%. We have practically already reached the target that we set ourselves, so we can no longer speak of European ambition if we speak of 20%. As far as I am concerned, I am not an obvious admirer of the carbon market, but if we stay at 20%, we can be sure that we shall be treating the carbon market as a species in danger of extinction and not as a lever in the fight against climate change. Moving to 30% would potentially raise EUR 8 billion for European budgets by auctioning quotas. We know 30% is possible. In particular, a binding 20% energy efficiency target would mean a million European jobs. This represents savings of EUR 1 000 per household in Europe and, since Commissioner Oettinger mentioned Nabucco, it is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos. Are we then going to kill off European businesses if we move to 30%? Obviously not. Every study shows this to be so. Some sectors potentially at risk are affected, but the means exist, and until now, the sectors that threaten Europe with extinction are the sectors that have been the beneficiaries of European energy policy. They have gained billions of euros thanks to European climate policy. Moving to 30% would mean clearly siding with those who are bringing about change, siding with those who are making tomorrow’s world. I should also like to cite some figures. According to the Ernst &amp; Young 2010 Barometer, China and the United States are the most attractive countries for the development of renewable energy. According to a recent study, only three of the 50 businesses identified as world leaders in green technology are located in Europe; the others are in Asia or the United States. It is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30%, and I shall conclude by echoing the words of Barack Obama when he said that we could abandon the jobs of the future to our competitors or we could seize the opportunity of the century, as they have already begun to do. The nation that pioneers the energy of the future would be the pioneer nation of the 21st century, he said. He lost the elections. Let us take up this leadership in energy transition and the new economy. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, just as the European Union is trying to redefine its trade policy after the Treaty of Lisbon, while at the same time trying to reconcile it with its industrial policy, the fact that this Parliament is simultaneously debating three reports that address issues ultimately falling within the same political and public debate on ‘what is trade and how can it be reconciled with social, environmental and human rights issues?’ is to be welcomed. In fact, we are ultimately in a state of permanent schizophrenia: everywhere, companies are relocating, social rights are being called into question, environmental degradation is increasing and, at the same time, we are negotiating free trade agreements, we are negotiating within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a whole series of measures which, unfortunately, are totally out of step with the public debate in which our citizens are trying to engage. How can we explain to our public today that a football entering the European market produced under decent working conditions, where the environment is respected, and a football produced by child labour or in a country where trade unions are prohibited is the same football? We cannot explain this to our public. Our responsibility today is therefore to integrate these environmental and social issues into trade. Regarding my report more specifically, with respect to trade there are currently a number of European countries whose imports of products largely offset the reductions in their own emissions. A third of Europe’s emissions are not produced in Europe but correspond to imported goods. It is therefore essential to integrate the climate issue into our trade policies. How can we explain to our public that, at the same time as concluding a free trade agreement which will potentially lead to deforestation, we are going to Cancún to negotiate a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) agreement aimed at providing financial compensation for non-deforestation in the countries of the South? It is therefore essential to reconcile these different issues. When we drafted this report – and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups – we tried to be as constructive as possible. I hope this will be reflected in the vote tomorrow. We also tried to put an end to black or white debates. We no longer say that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100% of our industries in Europe, where, in a way, we do not care, because the climate issue must take precedence. When we worked on the issue of carbon leakage, for example, we always tried to specify which sector of activity might be put at risk and which tools could be developed to protect that sector. The same is true for the laws governing the framework for the anti-dumping discussion at the WTO. The same is true for production processes and methods. On all these issues, we tried, with the other groups, to come up with proposals to move things forward, and I believe that we have come up with concrete proposals that are commensurate with our ambitions, with the mandate of the European Commission and of all the European institutions. I would just say once again that I hope that the cooperative, constructive spirit in which we drafted this report will be reflected in the vote tomorrow and, once again, I would like to thank all my colleagues for the work they have done. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Commissioner De Gucht for his answers and for his proposal for work. I have taken note of his reply on the climate chapter, and I hope that we will also manage to work on the remaining aspects and make proposals that will result in concrete action being taken and certain elements being included in the trade agreements. Finally, the fact that the trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, which are undoubtedly very complex, have broken down also offers the European Union various opportunities to integrate more innovative elements into bilateral agreements and to try to construct new types of trade agreements which further integrate the EU’s objectives with regard to the environment, climate, human rights or social rights. This is therefore, in a sense, an opportunity. I believe it is a very strong request, and if these reports receive broad support tomorrow, this will indeed be – and I want to believe it will be – an extremely important signal from the European Parliament to the Commission and to the Council. I would like to reply to Mrs Stassen, who has left, regarding the economy. Books on the economy have continued to be written after the 19th century. We can therefore see that the challenges concerning the way in which to integrate social and environmental issues into production costs are an important factor in terms of defining the reality of comparative advantages. Similarly, Mrs Muscardini, you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the European Union. Moreover, if you are prepared, with me and others, to combat the Blair House Agreement, which is, after all, the main obstacle to real food sovereignty, to real food security today in Europe, you will have my support. Thank you, therefore, to all my colleagues, and to you, Commissioner, for your openness towards concrete work and concrete action with a view to the agreements that will soon be negotiated and concluded.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioners, I think we must note the convergence of this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and its Committee on International Trade on this matter and on the proposals presented in connection with it. It has been said that fishing is an extremely important sector for spatial planning, employment and cultural identity in Europe. It is also a sector which has an extremely strong impact on fisheries resources, and today a great majority of stocks are considerably overfished. Too often people would have us believe that the ultimate objective of a European common fisheries policy is to adapt the fisheries sector to globalised trade in fishery products, the extremely harsh effects of which we can see today, whether it be socially, economically or, of course, environmentally. We therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products. We support the idea of withdrawing fishery products from non-agricultural market access (NAMA) rules, because a fish is not a sock or a washing machine, it is absolutely crucial to food security and biodiversity. However, we must be clear. Since we are bringing this into international negotiations, our European policy must be exemplary and we must move in the direction of having more and better paid fishermen who do not overexploit fish stocks, either in our territorial waters or in those in which we buy fishing rights.

Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment, deleting two parts of the amendment, namely the words ‘by the Colombian army’ and ‘on Colombia’. Therefore, the amendment reads as follows: ‘considers that the alarming news concerning the killings of trade unionists in Colombia, as well as the news recently received and now confirmed by Colombia’s public prosecutor that mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in recent years have been discovered in the region of La Macarena, are sufficient evidence to enable the Commission to open an investigation in accordance with the regulation.’ Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, during the night of 27 to 28 February, storm Xynthia hit western France particularly hard, claiming many lives. Naturally, our thoughts are with the victims and all those who mobilised to help them. We are calling very clearly for the European Commission to make the Solidarity Fund available quickly in order to help the most affected people. However, we must also learn lessons from this tragedy. How is it possible that there are between five and six million people in France living in flood zones? There is obviously pressure from the property lobby, but it is also true that a few months ago, President Sarkozy was calling for construction in flood zones to be permitted. Responsibilities therefore lie with politicians. We are calling for all European cofinancing linked to reconstruction and restoration to be conditional on respect for the law: coastal law and prevention plans relating to flood risk. Naturally, we are also asking once again that we show swift support for all the worst affected sectors, in particular shellfish farming. Yannick Jadot,

Commissioner, it is good that you want to debate the result of this tool before the European Parliament, but the main thing to respect with regard to the European Parliament is the ordinary legislative procedure. We will find this tool useful, but it could be more operational, more effective and more transparent. More effective, in particular, if it took into account all the decentralised energy sources. It is not a matter of counting every single solar panel, but at Member State level we have information that you could gather to see what all the plans for decentralised energy add up to. When we are talking about democracy and transparency, I am surprised to hear our Liberal fellow Member reply ‘bureaucracy’. This instrument must be transparent, it must be debated, and the Commission must consult all the stakeholders, unions and associations, among others. Finally, taxpayers are contributing a great deal to the energy transition effort, and it is important that we have information on funding, to know exactly how taxpayers are funding energy transition in Europe. I hope that the amendments that have been tabled will be adopted by a large number of Members tomorrow, by more than there are here this evening. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis-related protectionism into its proper context. I think that, in the context of a debate, it is wise of you to point out that a world war linked to the revival of protectionism is not about to break out. Now, I almost want to reverse the issue. For me, the issue is not ultimately about what effects the economic crisis has on trade, but more fundamentally about what effects trade, and specifically the trade policies undertaken for 20 years, have on the crisis we are experiencing today. In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets. In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us. I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it. It follows that, in all the national debates – and, as a key figure on the Belgian scene, you will know this – all the political parties are now discovering that it is impossible, in a globalised world, to manage social dumping, environmental dumping, monetary dumping and fiscal dumping. Similarly, we might consider that the strategy that all us Europeans expected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was to say ‘social democracy will come about through trade’, is not working, as we can see with the example of China. Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure. Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have. Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world? Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure. I have a more specific question: on 4 February 2010, a meeting of the WTO’s Committee on Trade in Financial Services was held, and it focused specifically on the challenges presented by the financial crisis and the liberalisation of financial services. Can you tell us what the outcome of that meeting was and what your opinion is on this matter, if you were able to follow it? Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, as you said, this agreement breaks new ground. It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it. Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties. It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship. Secondly, this agreement also breaks new ground because, in trade negotiations, it is usually the farming sectors that resist and the industrial sectors that are satisfied. In this case, we see that the opposite is true. For the first time, it is literally major industrial sectors that are complaining about the decisions made by Europe. Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market. Just what do these figures mean, however? I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany. If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem. Now, we are told that we shall earn a small amount of money from pigs by trading with South Korea. The reality, in the region I represent, is that this intensification of pig farming leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of added value, a loss of tourism and, consequently, in my region, we are the losers in this agreement. Perhaps in your overall calculation, people gain from it, but in a region like mine, people lose. Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for. We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change. The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO2
 emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO2
 emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad. We therefore clearly see once again that, when it comes to an industrial strategy, a strategy for our businesses and the choice of economy, it will be more the case that Europe suffers this agreement than that it shapes it. You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy, the green economy and innovation. I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged. Finally, your approach to discussing issues is often very balanced, but as soon as people start talking about taxes, all of a sudden … On the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the Tobin tax, I bet you, Mr De Gucht, that before the end of your mandate, the Commission will have to speak out strongly on the Tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets.

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, I have been very surprised at the self-satisfaction you show with regard to EU action in the climate field. It is true that Europe has done more and better work in the last 10 years than most of the other countries in the world, but there was clearly a failure of European leadership in Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, we also saw Europe become simply the combination of the personal communication strategies of the European Heads of State or Government, and I should like to specifically mention Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Brown in this connection. Under these circumstances, it is clearly easy to knock the UN process. It is true that the UN system is complicated, and that a G20, where the agreements are meaningless but there are opportunities for major publicity stunts, is much simpler. This means that this coming year, Europe must do more and better work. We currently have a 20% target. However, 20% actually means doing less in the next 10 years than we have done in the past 10 years; it means reducing Europe’s climate effort. This is not only absurd for the climate, when the scientists are telling us that we have to reach a 40% target, but it is also absurd for our economy and jobs. Therefore, Mrs Espinosa, please do not reduce Europe’s climate ambition to the lowest common denominator, to the objectives voiced by President Barroso, who does not want to budge from the 20% figure, or to those voiced by Italy and Poland, which will soon deny the existence of climate change. Reread Parliament’s resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30%. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as we know – according to a number of scientific studies and also Yvo de Boer – emerging countries are today making at least as much effort as Europe with a view to 2020. We also know that, in the negotiations, there is already a right of scrutiny regarding emerging economies, and that this is exercised more and more through the emissions inventory, through the report on the measures taken. The World Resources Institute has published statistics showing that China stands at around 70 tonnes per capita, a cumulative figure since 1950, whereas the United States stands at 810 tonnes and the EU-27 stands at 413 tonnes. We therefore kindly ask you to have the good sense, first and foremost, to use the European Parliament resolution as a negotiating mandate. This would be the best thing we could do for the sake of both the climate and our emergence from the crisis in Europe. Next, I call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to have the intelligence and the credibility to withdraw its amendment that says that emerging countries must do the same thing, must make the same commitments as rich countries. That is not acceptable, that is not serious. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, after 15 years of negotiating the trade aspect of the Barcelona Process, we have very serious doubts about whether the negotiation of a Euromed-type free trade agreement is the right solution to the social, political and economic problems in the region. The impact assessment, as has been said, above all revealed that there were some potentially very serious negative impacts, whether social, environmental or in terms of regional integration. In this context, Mr President, Commissioner, we believe that the proposal being made by the Commission – the road map for 2010 and beyond – is too one-sided, with its bilateral free trade agreement aspect, to be along the right lines. We support the draft resolution that is being debated today, not least because it asks all these questions relating to social impacts, environmental impacts and impacts on regional integration, and above all because, in paragraph 10, it calls for the aims of the trade agreements to be revisited, particularly in view of these social and environmental issues, and then above all because, by revisiting these agreements, we could perhaps think about reintegrating the trade aspect into the overall Barcelona Process.

Mr President, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths, and inaction, for us, is a crime against humanity. We know that this is an emergency, we know that there is no plan B, and yet, today, the negotiations are at a standstill. It is easy to say that it is the United States’ fault, but we believe that Europe is also hugely responsible. Europe is unfortunately no longer, as the Prime Minister claims, the leader in the climate-change negotiations. Extending Europe’s current commitments to the entire planet means having 4 degrees of global warming by the end of the century, 4 degrees of global warming! That is unacceptable, and it will no longer be enough, as President Barroso is also claiming, to hide behind the legislative character of this commitment alone. Independent studies show today that Japan, Norway and Switzerland are ready to make greater efforts than Europe. With regard to the emerging countries – China, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia – they too are making commitments domestically that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them. If there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel’s speech, it is how to be modest and how to be realistic. Let us stop pretending that everything stands still outside Europe, that the world has not changed since Kyoto, and that Europe is always far ahead of the international community. In refusing to take account of the requests of the European Parliament and, in particular, of its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has assumed responsibility for something very serious: failure at the Copenhagen Summit. It is not too late; Europe can resume its leadership by immediately increasing its reduction target to 30% and by granting at least EUR 30 billion in aid to the countries of the South. In so doing, we will lead the countries of the South and force an agreement out of the Americans. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths and will cause millions more in the future. Inaction is a crime against humanity. This is an emergency, but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill. However, countries such as Japan, Australia, Norway, China, Brazil and South Africa are making efforts that are commensurate with their responsibilities. This is not the case with the United States, and it is unfortunately no longer the case with Europe. Extending Europe’s ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees. That is totally unacceptable. However, it is Europe that holds the key to Copenhagen. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if the European summit, acting on the European Parliament’s recommendations, takes the right decisions at the end of the month, then Europe can boost the negotiations – with targets of a 30% reduction and a EUR 35 billion aid package for the countries of the South. Mr President, the way in which certain Member States today use aid for the countries of the South as a negotiating tool is, in our view, absolutely shocking. The distress of the countries of the South is not a matter for negotiation. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I am an elected representative from a region in the west of France, where there is a very high concentration of dairy farmers, and I do not believe that you have acknowledged the tragic social situation they are experiencing today. Commissioner, when you speak of ‘producers’, what I hear is ‘manufacturers’ and ‘distributors’. Dairy producers do not need your compassion, Commissioner. They do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis. Dairy producers need a genuine agricultural policy. They need strict quotas. That is why we are calling on the Council to overturn your policy and instead to create a genuine policy to support dairy producers and to put an end to this policy of destroying them en masse.Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, during those nine months of work, with the confidence and valuable support of all key players, including – and I say this most emphatically – MEPs, who never gave up the fight for truth and justice, we were able to gain an awareness of the extent of the elements incriminating Europe and the Member States in the implementation of the CIA’s secret programme. All these key players are categorical and all the elements, that is to say, the research carried out by the Council of Europe, the special UN rapporteurs, the Red Cross, national and international human rights organisations, investigative journalists, the testimony of the victims, of their lawyers and of CIA agents, concur: the Member States have to answer for their active or passive complicity in crimes of torture, secret detention and enforced disappearance. For nine months, I was able to see the patently obvious limitations of the investigative steps taken by the Member States and their stubborn determination to conceal the truth: lack of political will, prevalence of national interests, narrow remits for investigations, abuse of state secrecy, lack of transparency, restriction of the rights of victims and of their lawyers. The imagination of national authorities knows no bounds. In putting this report to the vote, Parliament aims to take a decisive step towards putting an end to the denial of reality, and hence of justice, which has characterised the strategy of the EU Member States for 11 years now. Through its recommendations to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, the report expresses a simple and clear will: every effort must be made to ensure that rigorous, independent and transparent investigations, capable of determining responsibilities and obtaining justice for the victims, are concluded. The European Union and the Member States owe it, first and foremost, to the victims, but they also owe it to Europe’s citizens, who are entitled to demand from our institutions, from their institutions, respect for democratic values and the rule of law on which they are based. To be effective, we had to be concrete and specific and to stay abreast of the issue so that we could identify the best levers to help justice move forward. We therefore chose to focus on the issue of secret prisons on EU territory. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of Eurocontrol, which I thank, and to the visits and meetings of the Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) (rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs), today there are grounds for the report to adopt recommendations of relevance to Poland, Lithuania and Romania in particular. These three countries are now before the European Court of Human Rights facing allegations of torture, secret detention and failure to investigate effectively. Your rapporteur is convinced, more than ever, that only a coordinated European approach aimed at supporting Member States can break the code of silence. The challenge for the Council is to take the matter in hand officially and to put it on its work agenda, to acknowledge its responsibility and, finally, to apologise. The Commission, while having taken note of the facts, has still not mobilised all its justice and human rights resources and instruments to ensure that Member States comply with their fundamental obligations. It must take initiatives to uphold the principle of mutual assistance and solidarity. Commissioner Reding, the report invites us, you, the Council, the victims and all those who seek the truth to return to this House in a year’s time. Last week, Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen resident in Germany who had been detained without trial for five years at Guantánamo, again came to Parliament to speak about his ordeal, still very current, and to seek justice for the victims. Commissioner Reding, if Mr Kurnaz has the strength to come back in a year’s time, will we be able to tell him that facts have been established, that responsibilities have been acknowledged, and that we can, finally, apologise to him on behalf of the European Union? (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate to support this work, which has been long and arduous and which, as I said in my introduction, will bring us together again in a year’s time. I think that a lot can be done in the Member States in a year. We are not, of course, prosecutors and we do not have to ‘provide definite proof’. We simply know – if I take the example of Romania – that an investigation has been carried out in the Senate. You have pointed it out; it has been mentioned. I am also aware that there have been numerous allegations. I know that Eurocontrol has found evidence of new flights connecting Romania to Lithuania. A case file, which is mentioned in the complaint against Romania lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, was drawn up by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Hammarberg, and submitted to the authorities. None of these elements forms part of the public findings of the investigation. I think that it is not about singling out individual countries for general opprobrium because colleagues have placed great emphasis – and it is, I hope, a strong aspect of this report – on our collective responsibility. What is, in fact, happening? The reality is that each country holds a fragment of the truth. As a result, each country must carry out its investigations to the best of its ability so as to be able to expose this system because it is, in fact, a system. We have no intention of stigmatising this or that country. It is clear and evident – no one can deny it – that, in Romania, a new investigation, a judicial investigation, must be conducted, because the elements –which do not constitute proof; we are not prosecutors – are nevertheless important enough to warrant the reopening of an investigation. The report calls for nothing more, nothing less. The report asks Romania to conduct an investigation, and calls on the Commission, in fact, to show that each country holds a fragment of the truth and that the Commission, in particular, has the means, the power, the duty and the obligation to ensure that this fragment of truth enlightens other countries so that all EU citizens can be informed. You can do a lot. The rule is noted: you are strict, and I congratulate you on your resoluteness and on your regular interventions on fundamental rights violations within the framework of the implementation of EU law. However, in flagrant cases of unexplained massive violations, the means must be found to be accountable for the violations committed. For example, as regards the issue of interest to us here, you can bring in prosecutors, you can pool, or help to pool, information. You can translate all useful documents. You can gather together information and make it available to the Member States to help them conduct these investigations. The letters you are going to send once again to each Member State – which I welcome – must contain all the new elements that have come to light, including the analyses carried out by Reprieve
 of the data provided by Eurocontrol. That is what we are expecting, that is to say, a lot of work in the next year for a meeting which, I very much hope, will be a resounding success. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, last Thursday, a vessel from Turkey ran aground: 61 people, including 31 children, drowned. Most of them were Syrian refugees. The following night, a vessel sank close to Lampedusa, resulting in the deaths of several dozen people from Tunisia. Each new shipwreck adds to the macabre head count of the thousands of deaths already recorded in the Mediterranean. One has to question the responsibilities of the European Union and its obligations concerning rescue at sea. These people are fleeing war and poverty, but they are also faced with ever more perilous routes due to the obsession with security that characterises our migration policy. I call on the Commission to propose guidelines, as the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union required it to do, concerning rescue at sea. I also call on the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), which has developed a new human rights strategy, to implement it effectively in order to ensure the security of migrants. This is a humanitarian emergency. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, Ms Schaake has raised a very relevant issue with the Presidency of the Council. I am sure its representative will endeavour to provide a response to it. The situation on the ground, as described, has peaked, reaching new levels of apocalyptic violence and horror – with 800 deaths last week. The Human Rights Watch report, systematic torture in one of the 27 detention centres and the witness reports given are quite unbearable. At the same time, for just over a week now, I think, we have seen fresh diplomatic initiatives which are maybe precursors of the wind of change needed to find a solution. I think, even so, that the meeting held in Geneva made a start – albeit limited and not totally satisfactorily – towards the proposal for a transitional government of national unity, obviously without Assad and his torturers, but including some among its numbers. This has two benefits. In this situation, just because we feel that a solution is possible does not necessarily mean there will be less violence on the ground. Quite the contrary. We could see an escalation of violence by the regime. From this point of view, this proposal both encourages the mass desertions seen among soldiers of the regular army but must also enable acceptance of members of the Assad regime and the Baath Party as part of this interim solution. As things stand, I believe that this is extremely important. I hope that this prospect, which was encouraged by the meeting of all the components of the Syrian opposition, by the Arab League this week, by the meetings of the Russian Foreign Minister with the Syrian opposition, marks a turning point in this situation which offers a glimmer of hope. Moreover, I think that the EU should fully exploit this glimmer of hope, especially at the meeting of the Friends of the Syrian people in Paris at the end of the week. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, your words are hardly of any reassurance to me regarding the European Union’s capacity to take action. To be honest, it is calling on the opposition to unite for the umpteenth time, listing the risks that the situation presents for the umpteenth time, risks that have already been proven and are still very much present: regionalisation, militarisation, communitarisation, etc. These risks are also the result of the international community’s inability to have provided its support in good time to a people’s uprising against a dictator. I also believe that the situation is now so complicated and so difficult that there is no correct solution any more. However, inaction will cost us even more dearly. In other words, in three months’ time, we will be having the same old debate and you will be telling us how militarisation, communitarisation and regionalisation have been exacerbated further. Yes, we need to act then but there is no correct solution. Faced with the need and duty to protect the people, we are practically faced with the dilemma of having to choose whether we should violate international law by bypassing the Security Council. Yet we have to put all the options on the table. I heard Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra talking about a force being present on the ground. I also heard what Ms Brantner had to say. These options need to be looked at. This is absolutely urgent. We then need to put pressure on Russia because Russia, I can assure you, is in a very comfortable position. Today in France, the largest arms-producing company is currently showing at the international exhibition of weapons, in Villepinte, with total impunity. I have not heard anyone in Europe or in France, or you yourselves, dispute this fact. I therefore think that Russia does not feel under any threat whatsoever. We all know it is about the carrot and the stick with Russia. What have you dangled in front of them in your discussions? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, finally, since the start of this debate there have not been many fellow Members who believe that this agreement does not, in one way or another, undermine the fundamental rights of European citizens. To put it simply, some people are saying ‘It’s better than nothing. It would be worse if there was no agreement. In the end, it’s worth chipping away a little at our rights if we can see a corresponding benefit in terms of security.’ That is what we have been saying recently. Yet we know perfectly well – we have not only been saying it, but we have also demonstrated it – that a policy of combating terrorism, in order to be effective, rather than just being moral or meeting international obligations, must respect the totality of human rights, international law and our obligations. It is extremely hard to believe that this agreement could not be demolished by a court, if ever we in this Chamber were not able to shoulder our political responsibilities, because that is what this is actually about. Will we manage to stand beside the citizens of Europe – past evidence shows that they can only rely on the European Parliament in these areas – or will we allow ourselves to be overawed by threats? We have seen what happened in the past. With regard to the system implemented by the CIA, when there were secret prisons, illegal transfers and torture on our territory, who stood beside us in the Council and in the Commission to set up inquiries and find out who is responsible? No one. We want to cooperate. We have no mechanism of accountability when the services operate outside the legal framework. This is a serious matter.

Mr President, I said that, during our debate here in Parliament, no one denied the fact that we were in the process of seriously eroding the rights of citizens. You say that the citizens are not properly informed. However, you have undermined your case, Mrs Foster. It is a serious problem if we take citizens’ personal details when they themselves are even less able to monitor them because they are not even informed. To be frank, I think it is not sensible to go down a road – and we are going to say this to the European citizens – which would lead to them becoming involved in an American-style system for fighting terrorism, with military tribunals in the absence of procedural safeguards, endless cases of imprisonment and detention without charge. I truly believe that European citizens deserve to be informed of the fate that you want for them, Mrs Foster. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, this is not the first time this issue has been raised. I believe that all the bodies – the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, civil society organisations – have, at some time or other, sounded the alarm. What is more, this alarm has been heard by the Commission. Greece has since launched a national asylum and immigration plan. Today, however, there is no escaping the fact that the situation in the detention centres – and I have visited some in Greece – remains an insult to human dignity, that, since the start of the year, dozens of people have been killed at the Greek-Turkish border trying to cross the River Evros, and that NGOs are now seeing, within the context of the economic and social crisis in Greece, a sudden increase in racist attacks; they have recorded 63 cases in Athens and Patras, 18 of which involved police officers, during the last six months of 2011. It is clear that, in the period leading up to the elections in Greece, we hear preposterous proposals and a surfeit of extremely xenophobic policies – which can only be described as anti-immigrant – like the proposal to build detention centres, but, in particular, the proposal to herd together migrants and asylum seekers suspected of being ill. We also hear political leaders characterise the issue of migrants as a time bomb for society and for the security of the country. Confronted with this, of course, the European Union must respond with its values, its instruments and its principle of cooperation and solidarity. In this regard, it should nonetheless be said to the Member States that threatening Greece with expulsion from the Schengen area is an absolutely scandalous proposal, when, at the same time, the Member States openly regret that the Court prevents them from sending the asylum seekers back to Greece under the Dublin Regulation. Frankly, this cowardice and this hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the European Union cannot be tolerated, and the Commission has a great responsibility in this regard to guarantee our fundamental principles. As far as Turkey is concerned, I believe we should try to look at the situation as it is. With regard to the Community readmission agreement, Turkey is calling for equal treatment. Yet this is absolutely a case of double standards, since there is no prospect of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas with Turkey … (The President urged the speaker to bring her speech to a close)
 and that, at this very moment, Turkey is welcoming thousands of refugees at the Syrian border. I therefore believe that we should stop passing the buck from one country to another and assume this fundamental responsibility jointly. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am very pleased with this report and I would like to take the opportunity to thank its rapporteur, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, who has carried out an extremely comprehensive job. I think that this report, as a whole, calls for and supports the democratic reforms and the protection of fundamental freedoms in Turkey. I believe that the messages that it sends are extremely clear and precise and that they are of course addressed to the authorities, but also to all the actors in the political arena and civil society to encourage them to become more involved in further strengthening the democratic State in Turkey. The report does not fail to make clear our grave concerns regarding the way in which the law against terrorism has been applied, directly threatening freedom of expression and opinion, the right to hold demonstrations, the freedom of the press and we are asking for this law to be amended, particularly Articles 6 and 7. We also support and call for a thoroughgoing reform of the judicial system: citizens, all citizens in Turkey, must be able to trust an efficient, impartial and independent judicial system and we support any reform that works towards this end. We have also looked at the Kurdish question and we are clearly of the view that education in one’s native language is a perfectly satisfactory proposal to provide a response to the Kurdish question that is political and not merely for reasons of security. I think that these strong messages are all more credible when we do not hold back on our demands in the Council, particularly to ensure true consistency and to enable the European Union to finally recover its ability to pioneer reforms in Turkey and to use leverage to promote them. We are asking for all these measures to be taken with a view to opening chapters 23 and 24. Our demands are also clear in the case of visas: we need a roadmap for the liberalisation of visas, as this situation in a country in the process of accession to the European Union is quite unique, and therefore totally discriminatory. We want these essential messages to be heard in Turkey and I would not wish for the readership of this excellent report and its importance in relation to the current situation in Turkey to be diminished or detracted from by questionable statements. What is the purpose of the reference in this text to the secular integrity of the armed forces? We are delighted with the huge amount of work which has been achieved in Turkey over a number of years to ensure that the armed forces recover their place, under the control of the civil authorities, and for military expenditure to be brought under the oversight of the Court of Accounts. What is the purpose of this reference to the secular integrity of armed forces which have served NATO since 1952, which are one of its largest armed forces and the presence of which is being made conditional on this secular integrity? We know the nature of the armed forces of a secular, non-religious State. That is what we want for Turkey and I think that together we must delete those words. As for the Ergenekon trial, lastly, it is not credible to cast doubt on all cases in the Ergenekon trial as we know, and the European Court of Human Rights reiterated this in December in a judgment, there are perfectly well-founded cases where arrests on the basis of accusations of crimes or criminal acts have been judged to be well founded by the European Court of Human Rights. We cannot let ourselves be suspicious of and rule out all the cases involved in the Ergenekon trial. My opinion is this: if we remove these two references, we will have the widest possible readership, which is extremely important, in Turkey, in society as a whole, and in its entire political and social fields. (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, I actually think that we are no longer talking here of repression or of an oppressed people, but of an intolerable terror, perpetrated by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. We only need to see how public hospitals have now been transformed into centres of torture, execution and kidnapping. Given that, I will not list the considerable number of people injured, the number of people who have disappeared, the number of detainees or the number of deaths. The UN Human Rights Council got it right when it said that we are dealing here with crimes against humanity. Ms De Keyser is right: Assad will have to account for his crimes before the International Criminal Court. In the face of this terror, I sincerely wish to salute the courage, determination and the incredible capacity for resistance shown by organised civil society in Syria as, despite everything, the food arrives, despite everything, information is exchanged, despite everything, protection is provided for those who demonstrate. Despite everything, medical care is provided in living rooms that have been transformed into emergency hospitals. I believe that the channels that are in place are precarious and dangerous. We should discuss and work to see how we might now intensify the movement of goods, care, food and protection via these informal channels, how we can make it secure, stronger and broader, how we can protect those who are risking their lives to move these goods. This, I feel, is the first way to give practical help, which is what we are calling for. Obviously, sanctions must be strengthened and it is necessary, above all, to ensure that they are implemented appropriately. I really do believe that the European Commission and the Council have to ask themselves how a boat laden with arms was able to sail to Syria from a Cypriot port to supply Bashar al-Assad with weapons that he is using against his own people. There is the Arab League initiative. Of course, it has to be supported, but vigilance is required too. We are well aware that the Arab League represents a set of extremely diverse interests. We are well aware that the initiatives there are proliferating before the Presidency of the Arab League is taken over by Iraq. All this is well known but, given the situation, the European Union must very clearly define its strategy and be able to deliver it on the 24th in Tunis. It is right that this meeting should take place in Tunis, because it is important. It shows that this story is, first and foremost, the story of a people at the mercy of its oppressor. We are looking at Syria as a piece on a complicated chessboard and, if we move that piece, we are wondering what the next moves might be. We have to come back to the base of the conflict, of this battle, to support the population. The story unfolding today in Syria is truly that of a society that is struggling for democracy and for rights. Without being naïve, we should see that as the main goal, towards which we should turn all of our efforts. As a result, the meeting on 24 February must allow us to isolate or bring on board those countries that currently support the Syrian regime. Of course, there is China and Russia, but there is also Algeria. We must apply maximum pressure to isolate Assad. That is one way to give practical help. We must also recognise the National Council. It has its faults, but we must maintain a political dialogue with it to help it to become the political interlocutor for the future Syria. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I would like to stress the last point raised by Ms Schaake, because, indeed, not only is it a disgrace, it is also utterly ludicrous, that the European Union and its Council have not come up with the political means to invite Turkey to the table to discuss the situation in Syria. It is now clear that the future scenario called for by Ms De Keyser can only come about through dialogue between Turkey, in particular, the Arab League and the European Union. It is true that there is no written script, but, nevertheless, we do have some assurances. Firstly, Bashar al-Assad will fall. He will fall. That is the deeply-held belief that we all share and, at best, he will be handed over to the International Criminal Court. He will therefore fall. What this tells us is that civil society has an incredible capacity, not only to mobilise itself, but also to coordinate and organise itself, and to do so neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city, through a totally effective and impressive horizontal network. Just look at what they achieved with the first of six stages of the general strike in Syria, when they called on everyone not to go to the mosque, not to go shopping, to close shops early, to stay at home, not to make telephone calls, to carry out some form of civil disobedience. ‘Dead Syria’, just like the ‘dead city’ that is often referred to. We can see how impressive the organisation behind this is. What we have here is a population adopting the approach of civil disobedience and non-violent action. I do not really want to repeat what you have said regarding the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and which was picked up by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, but I do not get the feeling at all that we are now on the brink of civil war. What is certain is that growing numbers of soldiers, including those in the Free Syrian Army, are assuming the role of protectors of the people in coordination with local committees. It is absolutely essential that we offer our assistance in this very specific battle on the ground, which is being conducted in a non-violent manner with the Free Syrian Army offering defence and protection. This is where we must be effective, offering very simple but practical things: help with radios, communications, intelligence capabilities for the opposition, capabilities in the field of new technologies once sold to al-Assad, but which we must now supply to the opposition. These are the concrete steps that we can take to strengthen their operational capability and I think ... (The President cut off the speaker) Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), we focused instead on communications regarding the new partnership for mobility, for two reasons: because of the aspirations expressed, aspirations to rights, including, it would appear, the right to mobility, and also because, to date, our migration policy with these countries clearly rested in the iron fists of dictators who, I am glad to say, are no longer in place. We therefore take a very positive view of the partnership for mobility but would like to question the link still established between the readmission agreements, legal migration and the fight against illegal immigration, relying solely on the report prepared by the Commission itself on readmission agreements. The report says that implementation is inconsistent and not transparent, that the negotiating mandate is unrealistic, that there are serious risks of human right violations and that even this assessment acknowledges that visa liberalisation has no impact on illegal immigration. I therefore think that a little further reflection is needed and then, above all, we need to develop an approach with these countries that is fully rooted in the mutual benefits of mobility, establishing a structured dialogue. And when we talk about partnership with civil society, this means both mobility and other issues, it is critical that this partnership with civil society, which is the key to success, includes a concrete mechanism for consulting civil society at all stages, early on during the implementation and evaluation.

 Mr President, neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission, nor even the Council, I was going to say, have stood helplessly by in the face of the extremely serious discrimination suffered by the Roma. Parliament is well known for its resolutions on this subject. The European Commission set up a Roma Task Force and issued a Communication on the issue in April 2011, and the Council adopted a European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies for each Member State at the end of June. Nevertheless, I feel that this text certainly has inherent weaknesses, attention to which was drawn at the time. This weakness concerned the goals that were set concerning the fight against anti-Gypsyism and discrimination. Consequently, now, with just one month to go before Member States must submit their strategies to the European Commission, we have grave doubts about the efforts governments have made to include stakeholders, local and regional authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Roma populations themselves in drawing up their national strategies. Above all, however, I have the feeling that day after day, an extremely worrying situation is emerging from the press, from eye-witness accounts, from facts related by NGOs and from reports. They speak of violence and hateful anti-Roma demonstrations, attempts on their freedom of movement, segregation at school, forced expulsions, human trafficking, forced sterilisation of women, and of the way that anti-Roma rhetoric has become commonplace in political circles. Faced with this, I believe that our positive, inclusive agenda must categorically go hand in hand with the utmost vigilance and be rigorously enforced. I believe that the European Commission must use all the means at its disposal to be extremely strict towards Member States in its role as guardian of the acquis communautaire
 and of the Treaties. Let me quote you an example. The massive expulsions that took place in France have just been unambiguously condemned by the Council of Europe as ‘an aggravated violation of human rights’. In its defence, the French Government cited the decision of the European Commission, which, as the French Government saw it, found the evictions to be completely compatible with European law. I believe that Member States should no longer be able to resort to this type of argument and that the Commission must be extremely strict. As for us, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we too must do more. In addition to our extremely important work, we should set up a monitoring group to include members of national parliaments, in association with NGOs, so that we can in any case fight much more effectively against the discrimination suffered by the Roma.

The Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from voting on the 2012 budget at first reading on 26 October 2011. We deeply regret the creation of an envelope of EUR 200 000 ‘to fund pilot projects or other support activities aiming to analyse the public acceptance of the exploration for and exploitation of shale gas and introducing a dialogue on this matter’. We cannot accept that a single European cent be used to fund propaganda in favour of shale gas. Furthermore, this first post-Fukushima budget still grants a substantial allocation to the ITER nuclear reactor, which is an extravagant and pointless project, and a dead end in terms of energy and ecology. For these two reasons at least, we were not able to vote in favour of this draft budget, despite the fact that green pilot projects, an increase in financial assistance for Palestine and substantial savings in administrative costs have been adopted. We have therefore decided to abstain, particularly so as not to weaken Parliament’s position in the difficult negotiations now due to begin with the Council. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am not sorry that we are having this debate, because at the end of the day, there has not been any discussion of Turkish-Cypriot relations nor of the situation in Cyprus since 2004. So this is the first time since then that we have had an open discussion about a European Union Member State in which there has been a United Nations international peace-keeping mission since 1964 in relation to a conflict with a country engaged in the accession process. Stating the facts naturally highlights the fairly ludicrous nature of the situation. As far as I am concerned, this debate is not about whether Cyprus is exercising its sovereign right by deciding to drill in its exclusive economic zone. That is beyond doubt. International law clearly says that Cyprus is in the right, but equally we could envisage a situation whereby, under a future agreement, the benefits from that drilling would be shared fairly between the two communities. Having said that, I feel that the timing of the operation is reprehensible because, at the end of the day, this decision is prejudicial to the negotiations due to begin in the coming days under the aegis of the United Nations. In my view, the role of our Parliament – as has already been demonstrated – is not to engage in one-upmanship but rather to make a constructive contribution to achieving overall peace within the framework of an agreement for a federal country made up of two zones and two communities. What is more, the substance of a future agreement is known and almost – I nearly said for the most part – on the table. The question that we need to ask ourselves as Europeans is what Member States and the European Union are doing to bring a political agreement into the world and to encourage all the stakeholders to take constructive confidence building measures. However, sometimes I feel that the question of Cyprus is intentionally left to one side, to be used when the need arises in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey. I would like practical measures to be taken today by the Union and the Member States to support and encourage a rapid resolution to what is essentially a European problem. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, the Frontex Agency is an agency that has been untouched by the crisis, given that its budget has increased from just over EUR 6 million in 2005 to more than EUR 80 million today. In other words, Frontex has grown without facing any awkward questions for many years. Ultimately, the Member States saw something to be gained from this: firstly, the availability of resources for their own internal operations; secondly, the opportunity to turn to Frontex when faced with countries that were seen to be failing to control their borders; and thirdly, the increase in Frontex’s powers and resources, which everyone was calling for. This also enabled the Director of Frontex, only two years ago, to tell MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who were worried about human rights being violated, that it was not Frontex’s job to deal with that issue; it was the responsibility of the Member States! Frontex has ultimately grown against this backdrop of irresponsibility with regard to human rights. I think that, today, it is really to the credit of Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, that the issue of fundamental rights protection was placed so high on the agenda of the negotiations. I say this, of course, because the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force and Frontex is now accountable for its actions to the Court of Justice, which is no small thing; and also because a number of reports show that the principle of non-refoulement has been violated several times during Frontex operations and that access to asylum application procedures, which is an inviolable and international right, has been somewhat mismanaged. We are also awaiting a report from Human Rights Watch, which will show that Frontex is responsible, to some extent, for the unfair detention of migrants. We therefore had a real problem with regard to respect for human rights, and I believe that the negotiations have enabled us to make serious progress in this area. Nevertheless, this does not mean that my group will be voting in favour of this mandate, because we believe that independence – as mentioned by Ms Lochbihler in particular – independent observation, and reliable, impartial and independent procedures for combating human rights violations, have not been established. This is what will ultimately lead my group to abstain. Moreover, I should like to take advantage of this debate in order to question the Commission and the Council on the results and the status of Operation Hermes, the most recent Frontex operation: boats, helicopters, 2 000 drowned in the Mediterranean since the NATO intervention in Libya. What did Frontex do during this time? I do not know. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, all these populations are putting a colossal amount of energy into overthrowing regimes that are enemies of freedom and are oppressing them. We cannot help but admire this energy, and it puts paid to the prejudices held in various quarters about the supposed backwardness of the Arab world. As has already been said, it requires a good deal of the European Union to rise to the challenge of these aspirations. For us to condemn the violence, support those who promote change, impose sanctions on the dictators, start again from scratch the deals we had negotiated with fallen powers, take on board the human, political and economic consequences of the upheaval that is going on, prevent counter-revolutionary attempts, mitigate the causes of destabilisation and rebuild our relationship as one of partnership, is a revolution in itself for the European Union. Who now seriously believes that Bashar al-Assad is capable of beginning a political process that would involve those who promote democracy and change, and would establish the rule of law? I certainly do not, and I do not think many people do. And yet, there is no appeal to President al-Assad to leave power in our resolution. Nor is there a majority, unless we see proof to the contrary, willing to call the atrocities committed by this regime against peaceful citizens crimes against humanity, which is what they are, and to bring a case before the International Criminal Court through a Security Council resolution. I do not think we have exhausted all the possibilities for diplomacy. Turkey could provide valuable help on this, if it can persuade the hesitant countries that have been mentioned, especially Russia and Brazil, but also China. Taking responsibility also means protecting. It means resettling refugees, activating temporary protection, rescuing people at sea. These are the concrete steps that the European Union should be proposing for refugees, instead of organising top-level crisis meetings to discuss EU law. If the EU wants to be consistent, it needs a system that will allow civil society to be involved at every stage in defining objectives and indicators and in implementing and evaluating the EU’s agreements with its future partners. This will represent real change for the European Union. Our partners are now accountable to their people, and their people are eagerly expressing their democratic demands. Baroness Ashton, you were correct in your intuition and your analysis, well before the revolutions began. At the beginning of your mandate, you said that the validity of the EU’s external policy would be tested in its own neighbourhood. How true that is! If the Union rises to the challenge of these peoples’ democratic aspirations, its role on the new world scene will no longer hang as a question mark over the suffering that is piling up. In the situation as it stands today, it is the status of the European Union in this 21st century world taking shape before our eyes that is at stake. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, it is very good news that populations are moving to reclaim their freedoms and rights, and to obtain a change of the political regime and more democracy. This is at the heart of the European Union’s foreign policy and of the European project. That can only evoke our enthusiasm and our support. The very bad news, however, is that these populations are suffering an extremely tough repression, demonstrating these values and aspirations while putting their lives at risk, and that is totally unacceptable. Thus, the imperative of protecting the populations, which has led to military action in Libya, must now take other forms to protect those who are demonstrating in these three countries. I think that the statements are extremely important – the legitimate statements, the aspirations held by these populations – but we also need action. As part of this action, we need an assurance that all those leaders responsible for using disproportionate force against their populations will not go unpunished. In order to do that, the diplomatic convocation and activation of the Member States of the United Nations Human Rights Council must be in full swing in order to get missions, reports and resolutions so that the politicians responsible get an assurance that these acts of violence will not remain unpunished. Finally, I think that we certainly do have methods for bypassing the ‘blackout’ of the press. Journalists, whether national or foreign, are facing considerable difficulties in documenting the situation. We know what to do; we have instruments for bypassing these obstacles. We absolutely must make use of them. Then, when we have the means to act, I think that we must find a way of using them. Clearly, this is not the time to chase the Syrian President to get his signature on a readmission agreement, which could, in any case, only be envisaged under certain conditions, including a very serious, effective and relevant programme, the implementation of reforms in Syria and the freeing of all prisoners of conscience and peaceful demonstrators, not just here, but also in the other two countries.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the popular movements in the Southern Mediterranean have clearly highlighted weaknesses in our European Neighbourhood Policy. As I see it, the problem lies not so much with the Neighbourhood Policy objectives, which are set out in Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty of Lisbon on promoting and respecting human rights and democracy – which are also social objectives – but rather in our flawed implementation of those objectives. Consequently, we need to learn lessons for the future. This is what is being done in the current work on reviewing the policy. The first issue, which was raised by Mr Schulz, is our ability to provide real and effective support for civil society in all neighbouring countries, irrespective of their importance in terms of trade or strategy, or their political situation. When neighbouring countries are in a state of transition, this is extremely useful and necessary. It is also undeniably easier than when they are labouring under the yoke of an authoritarian regime, as is the case in Syria, but this is a challenge, an issue, that we need to learn to address effectively. I believe that we will also need to learn to discuss these matters with our partners, not only in forums dedicated to human rights, such as sub-committees, but also at the highest political level. Yet, at the same time, we must ensure that sub-committee agendas do not become disconnected from the situation, as has happened in the past, or fail to feed into other bodies, such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA). I support the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which I believe is pivotal. It seems to me that we should also add a separate target for social justice and combating inequalities. Naturally, we will also need to rethink our understanding of mobility in the Mediterranean region. I think that the mobility partnership is a positive feature, but we will also need to learn how to promote the benefits of this mobility for individuals who travel between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and for both the host nation and the country of origin. We will also need to factor these changing movements into basic rights for those who cross the Mediterranean and settle in Europe. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, it is of course good news that we now have a concrete European framework that is going to place an obligation on every Member State to present its national Roma integration strategy. Between now and the end of the year, the Commission will assess these strategies and then in roughly one year’s time we will need to debate the issue again. Today, we are therefore in effect setting out a road map which should allow parliamentarians, public bodies and civil society to exercise ongoing, extreme vigilance in the very important areas you have mentioned. I note that the Commission communication takes on board some of the points we set out in the parliamentary report. I am talking for instance about the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency in the assessment of the strategies. I believe the Agency has proven its competence in this area. I am also talking about developing cooperation with the Council of Europe on training mediators from the Roma community. This is an important strategic factor for the success of the projects at all levels, as is the attention devoted to Roma who are nationals of third countries and the enlargement aspect, which is taken into consideration in this report. Lastly, I think that establishing common indicators to support the monitoring system is very much to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I must emphasise certain failings in this communication. I believe it is not sufficiently strong and insistent in its reference to the necessary participation of Roma at all levels, that is to say at the levels of preparing the projects, implementing the projects and evaluating them. The communication talks about information and consultation, but the involvement of the Roma community itself is vital. There is ample experience to prove this, because there have actually been good experiences in Europe as well. I find this a weakness in the communication. A second weakness in the communication is that it deals with the issue of non-discrimination as a cross-cutting theme in each of the four areas. However, I think it is very important, or would have been very important, to have a special paragraph devoted to combating discrimination and violence and to access to justice for the Roma. This anti-discrimination, fundamental rights, access to justice component is not included as a specific component in its own right. I find this another weakness in the Commission document. I think we also talked about the subject of mediators, a programme that was launched by the Council of Europe. It is good that it is mentioned in this communication. We could have mentioned, and you also could have mentioned the guidelines that have already been drawn up by the Council of Europe, so that we do not somehow end up with two strategies, or two types of framework for assessing the national strategies. I feel this would have been a plus in this communication. Finally, I think that the Commission’s work is not yet finished, and that the task force should continue its work, in order to ensure that Member States are constantly aware of the pressure on them from the Commission, civil society and local bodies to actually implement these guidelines.

 Mr President, the work that has been undertaken here on this report, under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume, is very important. As Mrs Malmström said, it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system, and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system. One ought, in fact, to call it an abyss, an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking. When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1-65%, when we have, in a State such as France for example, 75% of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal, when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect, we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission – and which is strengthened by the high quality report drafted under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume – namely, to improve the quality of decision making at first instance, is absolutely crucial. As I understand it, the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying, and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers. It should be remembered that Cyprus, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population. Let us listen to those States too, then, because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I do not think that we can welcome the revolution in Tunisia, on the one hand, and demand that the country implements the border control policy that existed in the days of the Ben Ali dictatorship, on the other. I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government, which has many other matters to attend to: its own refugees – as has been said – and overseeing its democratic transition process. The situation, then, is a new and exceptional one, and this should perhaps enable us to think up appropriate solutions while at the same time showing solidarity. Baroness Ludford is right – that is what is definitely lacking the most within the European Union. I think that the work of the European Commission, and of Parliament, could consist firstly in declaring a moratorium on the return of Tunisians, because that really is improper and inappropriate. We should also grant exceptional permission to reside to Tunisians who have already arrived in France and Italy, guarantee access to Europe to people seeking protection, and refrain from taking any steps or concluding any agreements that might get in the way of that protection, apply the provisions – as has been said – of the 2001 directive to all those eligible to take advantage of them, and accommodate refugees present at the border between Tunisia and Libya as part of the resettlement process. Next, I believe that we must think about forging cooperative links with these future fully democratic countries, so that Tunisians can come and work, study and travel perfectly legally, so as to create real channels of mobility between the two shores of the Mediterranean.

 Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work in providing rigorously detailed documentation and in drawing up a report in the utmost good faith with the aim of sending clear political messages, particularly on the eve of the legislative elections in Turkey, and I endorse this work. This report – unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable – stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution. However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors? There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations – in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 – and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner. Now, everyone can see that it is not. We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition. I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey’s accession. I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation. Today, this is very clearly in question. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Madam President, unfortunately, every day in the press, we read accounts of discriminative or racist acts against the Roma. Therefore, this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves, of course, and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union’s fundamental values. The Commission will therefore have to develop a framework, a European strategy, for the national action plans. Its responsibility will extend far beyond the development of this European framework for the national action plans, because the Member States will make progress on this subject only if they are given a strong incentive by the Commission to commit themselves to it. This will require – as the report explains very well – an extremely precise evaluation of the results obtained, with the use of benchmark criteria and indicators. It will also require the involvement of all interested parties and Roma communities in the first instance. I believe that it is very important to make the connection with the Council of Europe’s programme on the training of Roma mediators. This is an essential condition if the inclusion projects are to be crowned with success at regional level. Next, the European Commission also needs to get involved through its own projects, run by itself, pilot projects – that is what this report proposes – which could be run, for example, in the micro-regions that we have spoken about, so that exemplary, remarkable projects can convince all interested parties to become involved in this inclusion process. I believe, then, that the European Commission should also be able to use its right to officially complain when the values, European legislation and national action plans are not as they should be, bearing in mind equal access to all rights, non-discrimination and freedom of movement. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Gomes for giving us the chance to debate a mandate for negotiations that is certainly thorny, as is the content of the negotiations themselves. The Tunisian example should serve as a warning that we need to proceed very cautiously, especially in the way in which we report on the negotiations. We cannot simply notch up successes as we go through the negotiations and celebrate because a regime such as the Gaddafi regime may have agreed to certain human rights references, for example, because that regime is well-known for its major violations of all fundamental rights. What is more, all the migrants who arrive on our shores, though they are increasingly fewer in number, say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to Libya, because of the rapes, torture, abuse, forced repatriations, mass expulsions and racist acts. It has already been said, and I will repeat it: the list of serious, mass human rights abuses of migrants in Libya is long. So yes, of course, I think it is absolutely urgent that we do everything in our power to improve these people’s situation. This is a job for the High Commissioner for Refugees, and it is our task to resettle the individuals identified by the HCR. It is also a job for community-based organisations, which, at the moment, are extremely thin on the ground and need to be strengthened by all means possible. I believe that, if we truly want to abide by the goals we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties, we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants staying illegally in the EU back to Libya.

 Mr President, I think the aim of this discussion is to get the Council to finally show its hand, because I have to say that given such an ambitious, not to mention necessary, reform package on asylum, it is unbelievable that all we are getting are snippets of information, some contradictory, as to what is holding the Council up on these proposals that have been on the table for a long time now. We are getting a vague idea that the Council or the Member States may be stalling because of costs, but it is not even clear what is meant by this. Are they talking about human costs, political costs or financial costs? These different costs are sometimes linked in any case. One thing is for certain: there are instances of unsatisfactory practices and inadequate protection in Europe at the moment. In the first place, it is not true that Europe shoulders all the world’s problems. For example, in 2007, I think Europe took in only 14% of the world’s refugees. In the second place, some of the existing practices are utterly unacceptable. I am thinking of instances such as phallometric testing in the Czech Republic, right here in Europe, or the documents of the Committee against Torture, which brought to light many cases such as forced repatriation without the right to appeal or based on hurried-through procedures. I think we can certainly talk about costs: for example, we could talk about the cost of expelling migrants, which is very costly: the French Senate says that it costs EUR 20 000 per person expelled. Above all, we can talk about how we might improve the situation. There are certainly questions to be asked as to how we can improve the first-instance decision-making process, as Mrs Guillaume has done in her report, when roughly 50% of first-instance decisions are overturned on appeal. There are clearly very substantial economies to be made in terms of financial, human and political costs. We might take another look at the aberrations of the Dublin Convention, and I think the Council should look very carefully at these, because they also represent very substantial costs both in human and in financial terms. Lastly, and I will end here, one thing that is very expensive is detention, as the Parliamentary study confirms. The cost of detaining asylum seekers is prohibitive. This needs to be said, people need to be told and it needs to be discussed in the Council. This is absolutely urgent. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, this is a very good report, and the first one after the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, for her hard work, receptiveness and fruitful cooperation. I would like to come back to four messages contained in this report. The first concerns our requirement for the Commission to fulfil its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The situation of the Roma people has sadly been the first practical case, and the Commission has, in the end, only gone halfway on this matter, basing itself solely on the Free Movement Directive. The Commission has sidestepped the non-discrimination issue on the basis of Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it cannot be so half-hearted in future, with the ratification, by the Union, of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am delighted to see the Union’s commitment to seeing this through. The added value of this report also resides in the fact that it emphasises the need for early detection of potential violations through the implementation of a warning system. This system makes provision, among other things, for measures suspected of constituting such violations to be suspended while the accelerated procedure for determining whether they are contrary to fundamental rights is carried out. I would also insist on the need to set up a prevention system on the model, for example, of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism within the United Nations Council. Once again, I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes, as you have already mentioned, Mrs Reding. In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge. We are blindly endorsing these agreements when the actual terms of their implementation are being decided in joint committees from which Parliament is excluded. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).  
– (FR) 
Madam President, it has to be said that it is extremely odd to begin a directive which is intended to guarantee a legal framework for proper access to rights for all workers with a long list of the categories of workers excluded from that directive. That makes it seem like a project for legal migration but also for a multi-layered European labour market, where each category of workers would be assigned, according to their worth, a sort of portfolio of rights. We are therefore a long way from a horizontal and universal approach to workers’ rights. I think that those responsible in Europe have still not understood that more rights for workers means greater economic efficiency and greater social cohesion, with greater individual and collective benefits, of course, for migrants, for the host societies and for the societies of origin. Indeed, this has been shown in a study by the London School of Economics which says that regularising 600 000 irregular workers in Great Britain, who will not have access to this single application procedure, would bring GBP 3 billion into Great Britain’s coffers. We are not, I think, at all equal to the challenges. Hélène Flautre,

 Good evening Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Reding, you are quite rightly delighted today that France has responded to the European Commission's infringement proceedings at the eleventh hour and has provided a legislative programme for establishing procedural rights as required under the directive on the freedom of movement. According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice – as opposed to cancelled. We have taken note of your comments but as Members of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments. That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French authorities. However, let us not forget that you also asked France about individuals who have been escorted to the border and required to leave the country, an enquiry intended to confirm that these administrative procedures were not discriminatory. What has happened to those enquiries? Have you received a response? Just as the press revealed information about the villainous and discriminatory August circular, information was recently published about a file – a database – which contains personal information including details of ethnic or racial origin. Has this new twist not dented your confidence in the promises made by the French authorities and the accuracy of the information provided? Mrs Reding, would you not agree that the logical next step is now to tell us the current state of play in the ongoing examination of the documents requested by the Commission, both on the alleged discriminatory practices in France, but also regarding the potential infringement of data protection standards as laid down in Community law? I think that today’s European citizens are entitled to demand a responsible Commission which may publicise its successes but will also be determined in persevering with proceedings against the French authorities. After all, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which, it is widely recognised, have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma. I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data, in which the subjects are described as Gyppos, Gypsies or Roma.

 Madam President, I actually find our rapporteur very unwise in asking us MEPs to ratify and approve an agreement which really is highly problematic. First of all, it concerns Pakistan, which is not just any old country. Pakistan already admits more refugees than any other country in the world. And what are we mainly going to ask it to do? Readmit Pakistanis, of course, but also the Afghans who are here in Europe fleeing a war that we are waging in Afghanistan. I think we are starting to border on something like indecency here. It is a fact that Pakistan has not ratified the Geneva Convention, and it is a fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe asks us to ratify readmission agreements only with countries that offer a number of guarantees in terms of the right of asylum and international protection, which is not the case in Pakistan. Furthermore, there is a huge number of questions. If I had to say ‘Yes’ tomorrow, I do not even know what I am saying ‘Yes’ to. If you look closely at these various articles, the impact of this article may be anything from 20, may be anything from 100 to 20 000, and perhaps more. Why? Because nobody is saying what the responses will be to everything that is decided in the Readmission Committee. Who is responsible for proving that an individual arrived after the agreement had been ratified? Who will be responsible for proving that that individual arrived in the EU directly from Pakistan? What is going to happen at the end of the thirty day period if Pakistan does not respond and does not issue travel documents? Are we, as Members of the Commission suggest, going to accept this strange EU ‘pass’ instrument? I do not have any answers, and neither do you, Mrs Malmström; I know that you will be unable to provide me with any answers. I asked the Pakistani Ambassador, and he does not have any answers. All of that will be buried in the Readmission Committee. As we are incapable of saying what the actual impact of this agreement will be, I cannot say that I accept it. Everything depends on the answers provided to these questions. I think that we should say ‘No’ tomorrow. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, I must say that I fully share the consternation of Mr Swoboda and Mrs Weber. It is quite astounding that, after the various meetings you have been able to have and the documents you have received, you are still at this stage in acknowledging, or rather failing to acknowledge, the clear breaches that the French Government has committed in expelling the Roma. And this is not a new topic: a year ago, a group of voluntary organisations petitioned you on matters that are being raised again today, such as the failure to abide by the one month’s notice period before sending back European citizens that is enshrined in the Free Movement Directive. As regards the right to a personal examination of circumstances, I do not think you need any further expert opinions to conclude that when ‘escort to the border’ orders are handed out en masse
 in a camp, all identically addressed, this goes against the consideration of personal situations. Are six-year-old children a threat to public order? Do you really need additional proof, when justice and the French courts have judged this case and the French Government is using an extremely broad and illegitimate interpretation of a public order threat? If you need judges, experts or NGOs, we can provide you with them. However, please stop this denial of reality and this failure to fulfil your duties! The debate that took place this morning was a disgrace. We heard the leader of the European Parliament’s largest political group talking about the Roma people in connection with thefts of tractors in his local area. We heard José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, speaking during the debate on the Roma people about the security needs of European citizens. In other words, at the highest level of Europe’s political leaders, the tendency to automatically associate the Roma with crime, prostitution and trafficking is being boosted and fed. In doing so, they are placing fundamental rights and the whole point of Europe itself at stake. As Mr Cohn-Bendit said this morning: this is a test of you, Mrs Reding; this is a test of the Treaty of Lisbon, a test of your relevance. Will you be capable of proving, in this situation, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is anything other than a sham? It is down to you, it is your duty, and now is the time to proclaim this.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs in ’t Veld for her speech. At the very least, it clearly explains the reasons for her vote in favour, because from the start, in the speeches from the two large groups, I have not heard anything but smokescreens. The reality is that this agreement is not obviously any different, at least on the main points which motivated the opposition of the European Parliament in February. There are still cases of haphazard data transfer, and there is still the retention of data for five years. There is still effectively no right of recourse for European citizens on American territory, and there is the very important question raised by Mr Tavares concerning Europol. Europol is not a judicial institution, and it is not me who says that – it is the texts, the treaties. The European and national data protection supervisors are all in agreement on these essential points. As for me, I have the feeling that after having flexed our muscles – as you said, Mr De Clerck – we are now kowtowing, and this is not good news for European citizens. (Applause) Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the nine victims of the Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla, who were riddled with dozens of bullets, mostly at point-blank range and mostly in the back, could have been one of 42 nationalities, but they are nine Turkish victims. We can clearly imagine the mobilisation of the government in Turkey and the agitation of public opinion. Moreover, in the light of the actions, reactions and the pressure that Mr Erdoğan’s government is putting on the Israeli Government, today some would have us believe that this is a Turkish-Israeli issue and that it is nonetheless ultimate proof that Turkey has decided to turn its back on Europe and proof of its new foreign policy axis. Madam High Representative, I really would like you to clear up any ambiguity on this subject. It must be said loud and clear that it is a very good thing that Mr Erdoğan is being applauded by Arab public opinion because Mr Erdoğan is proving that using political instruments to act is more effective than violence and more effective than radicalism and extremism. I believe that this is a political lesson that we could encourage and support, and I call on you, Madam High Representative, to state this loud and clear. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, I would have preferred to hear from the rapporteur, Mr Tavares, but never mind; now he has finally joined us in this debate, and that is the main thing. I think that the work that he has managed to do to reach a consensus on the use of the European Refugee Fund, whose job it is to fund and encourage the Member States to develop their refugee resettlement programme, is exceptionally positive work, which Commissioner Malmström is strongly encouraging, and I am delighted to see that. We must nevertheless bear in mind a few figures, which will allow us to put the scope of this fund into perspective. If we were to allocate the entire European Refugee Fund – something that I do not want because it would inevitably be detrimental to the funding of the conditions of reception of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe – we would barely be able to resettle 20 000 refugees in Europe, a number far removed from the request of the UNHCR, which has established that there are more than 470 000 refugees worldwide in need of resettlement, that is, people who genuinely have specific needs, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and who cannot possibly return to their country of origin. We must therefore be sensible. To me, the second precaution we must take – because we have experienced this in my country, France – concerns the media coverage of the resettlement of some refugees as a tree of charity hiding a forest of malpractice, because at the same time, this country, France, has just been condemned by the United Nations Committee against Torture for returning asylum seekers to third countries where they risk facing inhumane or degrading treatment. I believe – and this is my final point – that these are the precautions that we must bear in mind. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, the Agency for Fundamental Rights reports that the Roma suffer every type of discrimination in every area, whether it be in relation to access to employment, to health care, to education or to housing. They are therefore the minority that is most discriminated against in Europe. In 2009, for example, on average, one in every four Roma was a victim of a crime against the person – specifically assaults, threats and serious harassment – on at least one occasion in the course of the previous 12 months whilst, at the same time, one in every three Roma was questioned by the police on average four times in the course of the previous 12 months. Their marginalised situation is compounded by their lack of awareness of their rights. This situation, which affects almost 10 million people at the heart of the European Union, which is now endowed with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and will soon be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, casts serious doubts over the policy of non-discrimination and effectiveness of rights, both at EU and Member State level. It took the racist violence in Italy in December 2007 to have a large-scale, high-level European mobilisation finally result in the organisation of the first European summit in September 2008. However, the call for a European Union framework strategy on the integration of the Roma, including a directive on the inclusion of the Roma, has still not seen the light of day. Member States – such as France and some others too – that maintain temporary measures for access to their markets for Bulgarians and Romanians are primarily penalising the Roma and must remove those measures as soon as possible as a sign of political goodwill. Member States must finally abandon the negotiation of bilateral readmission agreements with Kosovo, which are leading to Roma being returned to lead-contaminated camps in northern Mitrovica, as Mr Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, has been able to demonstrate. As regards the European Commission, I wish to remind it of the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2009 on the social situation of the Roma. In this year for combating poverty, I believe that we can at last decide to make the best use of our instruments and our Structural Funds with a view to resolving this serious situation.

 Mr President, firstly, I should like to welcome and congratulate Commissioner Füle. The 12th hearing of the trial of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink was held in Istanbul on Monday. For the first time, official observers at that trial felt that the court was sincerely trying to establish the truth and that the connections between this trial – that of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink – and other trials under way – such as that of the Ergenekon network – had been highlighted by the prosecutor. This fact is extremely significant because it is every political assassination, intolerance within society and the impunity that still prevails that are being put on trial here. Moreover, this is a view that the families of the victims of these political assassinations eloquently expressed when, referring to the Turkish ‘Deep State’, they declared themselves to be Hrant Dink’s ‘deep family’. I am telling you this because things are moving forward and because, within Turkish civil society, there is a desire and a movement for reform aimed at promoting democracy and rights, and this desire and this movement are exceptionally powerful. I should also like to cite another example which is making the headlines in the newspapers at the moment –family honour crimes have already been mentioned – and that is the young 16-year-old girl who was found buried in a chicken pen and who had been sentenced by the family council for having spoken to boys. This is terrifying and it is a crime. The members of that family will obviously have to be put in prison. The fact is, a few years ago, these crimes did not make the headlines. It is therefore pleasing today to see that these so-called ‘honour crimes’, which are simply barbaric crimes, are no longer being tolerated in Turkish society. Turkish society is in a state of flux, it is in turmoil even, and I think that, when we discuss Turkey, we must be keenly aware that any reform in that country deeply affects relations between citizens, the establishment, Turkish history and democracy. These are absolutely crucial elements. I believe that our process must be totally sincere. Today, the sincerity of our process is acknowledged, and it matches our ability to support the complicated, critical and historic process in Cyprus. Today, the EU must say clearly to Cyprus that we are ready to support and to guarantee, using all the means at our disposal, economic and financial means included, any agreement reached between the north and the south and that we are also determined to ensure that nothing in the body of EU law can hinder the achievement of a consensus in Cyprus. We must forge ahead; the future of Turkey’s membership of the EU is also riding on this issue. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, a question, yes, but which question? Addressed to whom and for what purpose? I believe that our delegation – of which you are a member, Mr Madlener – has committed itself and continues to firmly commit itself to human rights and gender equality and to every initiative taken to counter violence against women. I mentioned this just now in my speech. I believe that so-called honour crimes, which are crimes organised on a family or tribal basis, are utterly indefensible and that, today, it is very pleasing to see that no one in Turkey puts up with this type of archaic criminal practice any more. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, too, hope that everything is done at European level to encourage the Member States to assume their responsibilities and accommodate those Guantánamo detainees who have been proven innocent. They are victims and must be accommodated safely on European soil. Everyone knows, however, that the closure of Guantánamo will not stop questions being asked about human rights and counterterrorism, either in the United States or in Europe. In the United States, as you said, the antiterrorism law still permits unlimited pre-trial detention and trials before military courts. In Europe, well, the Guantánamo prisoners did not just fall out of the sky. I genuinely believe that there has been a failure to shed light on this subject. Mrs Hautala rightly spoke of the parliamentary investigation concluded on 22 December by Lithuania. It should be praised to the skies. It is exemplary. It must serve as an example. Conclusions were not drawn from these illegal practices on European soil, and I believe that that is the job of the European Commission; that is the job of the Council. We must draw every possible conclusion from the illegal practices which took place and which led to the opening of Guantánamo, a decision in which the Member States were fully complicit.

Mr President, I am disturbed by the speeches that I have just heard, from the Commissioner right through to my fellow Members. I feel that we really have our work cut out to gain an accurate and objective understanding of the present situation in Tunisia. Frankly, when I listen to you, I feel as though I am listening to western intellectuals talking cheerfully, many decades ago, about the economic and social success in the countries of the USSR, with a complete inability to go and see what our shared values stand for in practice in those countries. What are our shared values, Mr Michel? They are human rights, democracy and the rule of law. You have all rightly pointed out that Tunisia was our first partner to sign an association agreement. This is true, and that is why all this is very worrying, because we are not talking here about gaps, Commissioner, or about small steps. No. There is a huge, ongoing decline in human rights and democracy in Tunisia. Can you name one single newspaper, party or union that has been authorised in the last 20 years? No. The truth is that fundamental freedoms are being systematically and utterly disregarded, and, with them, our own commitments. This is not about moralising; this is about respecting the values of the European Union, and respecting the commitments that we made by signing this association agreement. Therefore, I demand that there be at least a shared analysis of this matter. I believe that we have worked hard to have this debate, but it would certainly be time better spent if we were to organise an actual delegation, one that really goes and meets this civil society in Tunisia and the various members of that society, in order to make an assessment of the continued harassment experienced by human rights defenders, students, trade unionists, workers and lawyers. There have been putsches in almost all of the associations that showed a certain degree of autonomy with regard to the authorities. I therefore believe that you are completely deluded on this matter. Having listened to your speeches, I well understand why you do not want to see the real picture in Tunisia. You do not want to see it because you believe that there are economic interests at stake, and because you believe that there are interests at stake relating to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration. You have expressed all this in the clearest of terms, and you go on about advances relating to equality between men and women and to the family, advances that date back to Bourguiba’s time. I repeat, these date back to Bourguiba. There has been no further progress since that time. I therefore believe that, if we have any respect for ourselves, for the agreements we sign, for the Neighbourhood Policy or for EU values, we certainly cannot propose an advanced status for Tunisia. Therefore, I tell you straight: if you propose that and renounce all requirements and all commitments in relation to human rights and democracy with all the countries of the Mediterranean, that will be the guaranteed outcome.

 Madam President, Commissioner Rehn, thank you for remaining with us at this late hour to discuss democratisation in Turkey, a subject on which you have done a great deal of work, for which I thank you. I believe that there were very many of us who, when the government announced its democratic initiative, its democratic opening-up, recognised just how bold a step this was and, at the same time, believed that this huge ambition represented a long road ahead, a road that would probably be full of pitfalls; the pitfalls appeared fairly quickly. The first act, as you said, was the dissolution of the DTP, but I also note that, alongside the ban on the DTP, the ban on engaging in political activity, which affects several elected members of its party, also eliminates the figures who were most heavily involved in the democratic and political dialogue to resolve the Kurdish issue. This leaves a question mark hanging over this decision. Next, there is also this wave of arrests which, today, are genuinely removing political leaders and therefore also the spokesmen on this Kurdish issue. Yet the Kurdish issue is central to the democratisation process in Turkey! Primarily because it is systemic, because it represents many years of suffering, violence, conflict and war, the tragic scars of which are still in evidence today; and these scars are also economic, social, cultural and political. This Kurdish issue is also placing a huge strain on the democratisation process. It is placing a strain on freedom of expression, on freedom of the press, on the rights of citizens and on the fight against torture. And when I see today how anti-terrorism legislation is being used as a cover for political reprisals, I say that now really is the time when we have to support the government and expect it to take another extremely ambitious initiative to emerge from this situation because, as we know, not all the established groups in Turkey are interested in a democratic settlement of the Kurdish issue. We are well aware of this fact, as we have been since the beginning. Therefore, Turkey now needs our support, our unfailing support in this process of democratisation. My fellow Member, Mrs in ’t Veld, is right to say that this unfailing support must include the renewal of that promise of membership once the democratisation process has been completed; it is absolutely crucial to say this. Next, the government will eventually have to produce reforms, which will inevitably have to lead to a new draft constitution. Immediate reforms will obviously relate to legislation on political parties. They will also relate to electoral reform – as a matter of extreme urgency – and to the independence of the judicial system. These fundamental pillars for a democratic state in Turkey must now be courageously and determinedly promoted by the Turkish Government. Moreover, this government must also implement initiatives to encourage consensus and reconciliation, because polarisation of society and of the political forces in Turkey would have a disastrous effect on the search for the consensus needed for the adoption of a new constitution, which we are all hoping for.

Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Malmström and the Swedish Presidency on their excellent conclusions. They revive the expectation that we all had, namely that it would be confirmed that the EU is indeed responsible for peace in the region under international law, and that, I believe, is crucial. Nevertheless, I am surprised that, one year after the military invasion of Gaza, no reference has been made, in these conclusions, to the follow-up to the Goldstone report sought by the Council. What stage are we at in the follow-up to this Goldstone report, to which the Council committed itself, notably with regard to the internal investigations involving the various parties concerned? Next, I am delighted that East Jerusalem is being considered as the capital of the future Palestinian State, or the Jerusalem of the two States. Nevertheless, these conclusions lack specific operational options. On the other hand, there are very many such options in the mission report by the Heads of State or Government who visited East Jerusalem. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to kindly clarify for us the specific methods by which, in fact, the European Union will neither recognise nor legitimise the annexation of East Jerusalem that Israel is currently seeking to achieve by, among other things, introducing economic measures, but also by orchestrating the mass displacement of Palestinian communities.

Mr President, I am talking here about so-called targeted sanctions, about intelligent sanctions, those that have a direct impact on fundamental rights too – the fundamental rights of individuals, organisations or legal bodies of any kind. These fundamental rights are important. They can include, for example, freedom of movement, but also protection of property. It is for these reasons that these targeted sanctions must comply with a number of minimum rules in terms of procedure and legal certainty. I would add, moreover, that respect for these legal and procedural rules is crucial if these targeted sanctions are to be credible and, therefore, effective. It was the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe – we in this House remember – that, through one of its then Members, Dick Marty, demanded transparency and the right of defence and which showed the absurdity of this lack of transparency where the effectiveness of listing and delisting was concerned. Listing and delisting were liable to affect innocent people too, people who were unaware of what was going on around them and unable to do anything about a situation that they generally stumbled upon by accident. That is why access to data, as mentioned by Mr Michel, communication of the grounds for listing, and protection in the transfer of personal data, are crucial elements of this procedure. Moving on, it nevertheless took a great deal of perseverance on the part of the victims of the United Nations’ and the European Union’s system of sanctions and the mobilisation of civil society, human rights organisations and also the European Parliament to have these victims’ rights recognised by the European Court of Justice. I would add that the Council’s amendments concerning blacklists depend on the proposals that have been made, including by the European Parliament. That is why the European Parliament absolutely must be involved in taking, implementing and monitoring these decisions, since history shows that it was the European Parliament that made the reform of the Council regulation possible.

 Mr President, the following is an extract from a letter written by William Bourdon, Taoufik Ben Brik’s lawyer, to Mr Sarkozy, President of the French Republic: ‘I have had the opportunity to denounce, as all his Tunisian lawyers have done, the legal farce which has resulted in Taoufik Ben Brik being sentenced, without in-depth examination, to a staggering six months in prison. I can unequivocally and formally attest to the fact that the dossier of the proceedings which led to this conviction was totally fabricated and was based on the personal vendetta of President Ben Ali. Throughout this year, 2009, he has been unable to travel since the fragility of his immune system is such that he is always at risk of being exposed to serious diseases. I believe that his family have succeeded in bringing him essential medicine, but I am not certain of this. His Tunisian lawyers have only intermittent access to their client, and some are systematically denied any possibility of visiting him. The only time that his wife has been able to see him was for a few minutes a few days ago, and she has been unable to see him again since.’ Mr President, please write to the Tunisian authorities to request the release of Taoufik Ben Brik.

Mr President, I agree, and so does my group, that the European Union’s enlargement policy is one of its most productive and most convincing policies. That is why, Mr Rehn, I am a little concerned for your future, because I am not entirely sure how you are going to be able to find a portfolio within the future Commission that is more attractive than that of enlargement. It is absolutely astounding to see what the prospect of membership can bring about as a force for change, for democracy-building, in a country such as Turkey. Yes, of course, there are still many things to achieve: the independence of the judiciary, a role for the army, freedom of expression, that all aspects of the Kurdish issue are genuinely dealt with once and for all, of course. However, I feel it is important to emphasise that this EU enlargement strategy is not just for the benefit of the countries that are going through the accession process; it is for our benefit and for the benefit of our European decision makers, too. It is irresponsible to diminish the efforts to change of a country such as Turkey by allowing doubts to remain about the outcome of the negotiation process. Yes, the outcome of the negotiation process will be that Turkey joins, and we must say so clearly. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that we are having a debate today on this issue because it is clear that the Heads of State or Government had expected the deportation of irregular migrants from the European Union to Afghanistan to be carried out without any fuss, and that is not the case. It is not the case for two reasons: firstly, because the European Commission has requested information from the United Kingdom Government and the French Government, which is a good thing, and, secondly, because we are having a debate on this subject today. Questions have already been asked. Is Afghanistan a safe country? Well, we should ask Mr Obama that, as he has just decided to send 34 000 soldiers there. No army is able to guarantee the survival of its men in Afghanistan, and are we supposed to be able to guarantee that the lives of the migrants that we send back to that country will not be endangered? This situation is a joke, and the UNHCR is not putting up with it either, as it has warmly recommended to the Member States that they do not proceed with deportations of this kind. Secondly, there is ambiguity surrounding collective expulsions. Everyone – and I most of all – welcomes the future binding character of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 19(1): ‘Collective expulsions are prohibited’. You tell us that this is not a collective expulsion. Mr Billström has a charming way of putting it, since he tells us that this is a reasonable mobilisation of resources. Soon, common charter flights are going to be sold to us in the same way as car pooling to combat global warming is. There are limits! And what are those limits? Well, I can tell you, as an elected representative from Pas-de-Calais, where there are many Afghans – who have given rise, moreover, to these deportations organised by Mr Besson in France – that, when the French Government decides, for communication purposes, to organise a collective return operation and to turn it into a media event, there are arrests in Pas-de-Calais: collective arrests, which are therefore illegal because they are discriminatory. Therefore, we absolutely cannot guarantee what you are saying, Mr Barrot, namely, that this is a joint operation for people who, following individual assessments, have been found to be irregular migrants. This is indeed a case of collective expulsion because there was a collective arrest. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, on Thursday, I was in Tunis for the trial of the poet and writer Taoufik Ben Brik, indicted in Tunisia on obscure common-law charges that fool no one. Since the ‘elections’ in Tunisia, held on 25 October, those who defend human rights have been subjected to an outburst of violence and harassment on such a scale as I have never before witnessed, familiar though I am with that country. On 25 October, President Ben Ali no doubt realised the full extent of the Tunisian people’s disaffection with their leader; and the embassies and the European Commission, which unfortunately does not have the political visa to attend this kind of trial, have displayed a general lack of interest in the issue that is unfolding. I think we must be very clear today. We are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue. What is stopping the embassies and the European Commission from rigorously questioning Mr Ben Ali – in the name of our binding agreements and mutual commitments with Tunisia – about his actions, which are entirely contrary to those commitments? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, something very simple is going to happen for our European Parliament with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon; we are going to have another 18 MEPs from 12 Member States of the European Union. We have been prudent because, in March of this year, the European Parliament asked all the Member States to anticipate this result by stating, as the method of appointment, that the elections on 7 June would be the democratic basis for sending these additional eighteen MEPs. Some Member States did so, like Spain and your country, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Other countries, which nonetheless state that they are very content, as am I, with the result of the Irish referendum and are keen to see the Treaty of Lisbon implemented, have still not done their duty, as far as their own will is concerned, by stating their method of appointment. Can we count on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to ask each Member State at the European Council on 29 and 30 October to state the method of appointment of these additional MEPs under the Treaty of Lisbon? The second thing that really shocks me is that everyone is talking about the grand ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it imposes an obligation on us in connection with one very simple thing: equality between men and women. This is a binding objective of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the Treaty of Lisbon. I understand that, for the additional two posts which remain to be filled, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and the President of the Council, only men’s names are being circulated. Your country, Sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question. I expect you to take this extremely seriously. It is not possible for us to only have men in the four major positions of responsibility in Europe. It is not worthy of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not worthy of Europe. I am counting on you to ensure that equality between men and women is respected at this level also. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, the last time we held a debate after a tragedy in the Mediterranean was on 1 April. You will recall that many hundreds of migrants perished off the Libyan coast. We had called for an investigation. To date we have received no information concerning the circumstances of that tragedy. Since then, as you know, in mid-August, 73 Africans were found dead off Lampedusa. On 25 August, 57 Eritrean migrants were finally rescued after a lengthy spell in Maltese waters. On 31 August, 75 Somalis were refused entry to Libya. Really, the external borders of the European Union have become murderous. This is the title of a report due out by the NGO ‘Migreurop’, which I invite all of you, ladies and gentlemen, to obtain and to read assiduously. Confronted with this situation, Mr Barrot, you refer to some key issues. You refer to the right of asylum, to the right to international protection. You should also refer to the right of any person to leave any country, and to the obligation placed on everyone to help others, whoever they may be. This is international maritime law. These situations are on the increase, and they are also occurring more and more at the border between Turkey and Greece. This is why I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that strengthening Frontex’s resources will be the answer to this situation. I believe that the European Union, today, is up against its own project. The European Union was born out of the refusal to deny others their dignity, and it is to this that it must remain true. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, this gives me an opportunity to clarify two small points which, I believe – and as one of my fellow Members said just now – highlight the hypocritical nature of our policy. The first point concerns the Dublin agreements. Commissioner, you know the situation in Calais well; you know that, in Calais, many people could easily apply for and obtain political refugee status. Why do they not do so? Because, as a result of the Dublin agreements, they are guaranteed to be sent to countries to which they do not want to go, and sometimes for excellent reasons. They do not want to go to Greece, where they have practically no chance of receiving refugee status. Today, the Dublin agreements are an instrument that is hostile to the protection of those people who need them most and which create inequality among the Member States. So let us stop talking about solidarity, when instruments are put in place that create inequality among the States. The second point concerns the readmission agreements. I fully understand, the aim is to negotiate these agreements with Turkey and with Libya, that is, to toy with the idea of having one huge environment of countries that are our neighbours and huge camps for holding the migratory flows. This is unacceptable for practical reasons, for moral reasons and for political reasons, and you know it, Mr Barrot! Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have a problem which means that I am not going to vote for you tomorrow, but you know what it is, since my group has explained it well. It is a political issue. You do not have a project for transforming Europe environmentally and socially. And yet that is, I believe, what needs to be done today. However, as Mr Daul elegantly put it, it was the right that won the elections, therefore you are on the right. The situation is clear. I should like, however, to be able to have respect for the President of the Commission, but I have a problem with this: when I see you, I inevitably think – and I assure you this is true – of your responsibility in the CIA’s secret flights. Between 2002 and 2006, 728 people were transferred to Guantánamo via Portuguese airspace. You were minister from 2002 to 2004. I therefore cannot believe you, Mr Barroso, when you make declamations about Europe being a champion of human rights. What I expect from you – what I hope for from you, because I would like, in the future, to respect you as President of the Commission – is not your memoirs, in however many years’ time, but that you will acknowledge your responsibilities in this serious act, which casts a shadow over European values.Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 This report on small-scale coastal fishing, artisanal fishing and the reform of the common fisheries policy is important because it underlines the importance of ‘small-scale’ fishing in the EU, particularly in terms of job creation, regional diversity and development, and because it marks Parliament’s general refusal to privatise access to fish stocks, refers to the need for a flexible definition of artisanal fishing (what is small-scale in the Netherlands is not small-scale in Greece) and supports the application of environmental and social criteria for determining access to fisheries resources and market distortion. However, the final version of the motion for a resolution crosses a line of acceptability in advocating support to cover sudden short-term increases in fuel prices. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is firmly opposed to support of this kind. I therefore abstained from the vote. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

One of its recommendations is that the Member States should propose both a male and a female candidate for the post of Commissioner, which is a positive step However, there is no requirement for gender parity in the drawing-up of lists or in the final results, even though this is of vital importance considering that only 30 % of MEPs are women.

 After a heated debate on shale gas extraction, and a great deal of back and forth in the Chamber, during which, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I expressed my strong opposition and outlined the concerns of developing countries, particularly in terms of land grabbing and access to water, fertile soil and food, which potentially call into question their food sovereignty. Today we voted on the two reports of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE Committee) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, at last adopting an EP position on this highly controversial subject. Although the ITRE report was in favour of shale gas, totally irresponsible and unacceptable, Mr Sonik’s report was more open to discussion. In the end, I abstained in the final vote on this report. The reasons are simple: on the one hand, this report rightly favours the adaptation of the European regulations, and demonstrates the EP’s desire to provide a framework for fracturing and to respond to the challenges; on the other hand, the moratorium, or more precisely the proposed amendment urging the Member States not to authorise any further hydraulic fracturing in the EU, was rejected. In any event, I am completely opposed to shale gas extraction. Catherine Grèze,

 Madam President, I am absolutely against the extraction of shale gas. These are matters that go way beyond our European borders with appalling effects on our water resources. Imagine yourselves what the consequences could be, and how devastating they could be, in developing countries where access to water is vital. But the extraction of shale gas is also about land grabbing and poor land quality; in other words, it brings into question food sovereignty in many countries. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, despite the publicity, despite the brazen lobbying that has been carried out even at the very door of the hemicycle, I would urge you to shoulder your responsibilities. We need a binding legal framework for European businesses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Catherine Grèze,

 Madam President, what an honour to have to reply to all of these questions! Regarding the point about which developing countries are carrying out research on shale gas extraction, as far as I know countries including South Africa and Morocco have already undertaken some research. But you can reply on multinationals the world over to seek out the last drop of a resource wherever it may be. On the issue of water, raised by my colleague, and the impact on water resources, it seems we have different sources of information. I saw an excellent film, Gasland

Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) has become a very important subject in the debate on EU development policy. The Treaty of Lisbon makes eradication of poverty an overall goal of EU development policy (Article 21) and, with the aim of achieving this goal, states the need for a coherent approach in terms of EU external action, covering trade, agriculture, fisheries, climate change and tax havens (Article 208). Unfortunately, the report in question is not an evaluation of implementation of PCD or its weaknesses. Rather, it is a report on what PCD should be. There are positive elements in the report, such as recognition of the right of developing countries to define their own policies by democratic means and to protect their economy. However, I could not allow myself, in the name, indeed, of genuine Policy Coherence for Development, to vote in favour of a resolution that encourages the expansion of agri-fuels in developing countries and supports agro-industry. That contributes towards land grabbing and runs wholly contrary to the notion of food sovereignty. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

This text rejects the arbitrary cuts proposed by the Member States for the 2013 budget. In its proposal, which Parliament supports, the Commission called for an increase in payments in order to meet budgetary commitments and outstanding payments from previous years. I abstained in the vote, however, because it supports the funding for the ITER nuclear fusion programme, a pipe dream that is a money pit for the European budget. At the same time, the report calls for cuts in certain lines, including some that are linked to development cooperation. I also voted in favour of amendments that sought to use the nuclear funds to finance programmes to dismantle plants, though these were rejected. I abstained on the amendments calling for a reduction in the subsidies for tobacco production. These reductions would have a severe impact on small farmers. Unless we call for a ban on the production and marketing of tobacco, this reduction would be counterproductive. Finally, I abstained, too, on the amendments calling for a single seat for the European Parliament. We need to have a real debate on that subject, not just a few amendments, as is the case here.

I voted for this report, which emphasises the European Parliament’s strong and united position on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the years 2014-2020 in the run-up to the November European Council on this issue. The report reiterates our support for a 5 % increase in the budget in relation to 2013, that is to say, an additional EUR 100 billion. The multiannual financial framework is Europe’s only way out of the current crisis. Given the stakes, it must be up to the task and it must finance the commitments made by all of the European institutions, particularly in the areas of climate, development assistance, research, employment and the fight against poverty. In addition to the issue of the percentage, the other main problem is that of the EU’s own resources. In that regard, too, Parliament sets out a united position in favour of the creation of new own resources, such as the Financial Transaction Tax. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The European Parliament has just approved the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA), which will be annexed to the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel. This agreement, as adopted, does not guarantee that the products that arrive on our market will not be partly manufactured in the settlements, contrary to the provisions of European and international law. Let us not forget that the European Union condemns Israel’s settlement policy, which it considers to be illegal, and that it decided in 2009 to suspend any upgrade of relations with Israel (following the launch of Operation Cast Lead against Gaza). We are therefore sending out mixed messages, which are contradictory and difficult to understand. It is for this reason that I voted against the adoption of the agreement. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted in favour of the report by Charles Goerens on the future of development policy as it seems to me to be positive on the whole. The aim of the report is to refocus the discussion on the priority aspects of development policy, in particular the criteria for public development aid, independent strategic reflection, the issue of differentiation (emerging countries) and aid for local trade. I am particularly happy about the positive vote on the paragraph introduced by the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the Committee on Development, which aims to refocus aid for trade facilitation instruments, which currently targets the export sectors, so that it also supports local and regional trade.

 Until now, the number of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of energy is unknown, as Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of such agreements. According to the Commission, Member States are becoming increasingly obliged to accept regulatory concessions, which is incompatible with European law on the matter. In addition, as the Commission does not know exactly how much energy is being imported, it cannot provide for market fluctuations or the means to alleviate them. Consequently, the Commission has proposed to put in place an information exchange mechanism with regard to energy agreements with third countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tried to strengthen the proposal by allowing the Commission to have access to agreements before they are signed, in order to be able to advise Member States on their compatibility with the law. Such a measure would also strengthen transparency. The Member States did not want this, and the rapporteur did not seem to care, preferring a bad agreement to no agreement on the subject at all. I personally voted against this text. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently three quality labels for agricultural products in the European Union (protected geographical indications (PGI), protected designations of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG)). The Commission wishes to reform this system in order to simplify or facilitate new entries, in particular. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it was important to take advantage of this overhaul to promote the introduction of a new ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label. We also called for the introduction of a ‘mountain’ label to highlight the considerable added value of products from these regions, where agriculture is often traditional and extensive. These two measures were passed during the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we are pleased about that. However, during the negotiations in trialogue with the Council and the Commission, the Members representing Parliament sacrificed the ‘local agriculture and short supply chains’ label, which is nonetheless important for encouraging these kinds of agricultural practices. That is why I voted against this text, which was initially encouraging. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 Although the free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia/Peru should be ratified shortly, Parliament has just voted on a text establishing safeguard clauses for the banana sector. The safeguard clauses enable us to temporarily reinstitute normal customs duties or to suspend tariff liberalisation. The text recognises that there are problems in terms of employment rights in the countries concerned, although this recognition is not sufficient. The rapporteur also calls for greater consideration of social and environmental aspects within the framework of the forthcoming economic liberalisation. The Commission must understand this message. Moreover, the texts clearly state the need for greater consideration of overseas countries, where bananas are a pillar of the economy. This vote should not make us forget that the real issue for these regions is a transition towards a more diversified and more sustainable economy. For all of these reasons, I voted in favour of this report. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The matter at issue here is the future of the seas. The Salavrakos report deserves to be supported for its long-term perspective on the sustainable development of fishing in the EU, but we cannot allow it to be watered down in this way. I shall explain what I mean by this: Amendment 2, which was adopted with the help of the regionalists who swung the vote, has destroyed the call to allow fish stocks to increase to levels above those capable of producing a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This means that the EU has failed to meet even the requirements of international law. I therefore ended up voting against this text, for, although it does take account of some important aspects (ceilings for the renewal of fleet, areas for repopulating fish), it does not take sufficient account of numerous points including overfishing and the objectives set by the common fisheries policy.

 The Commission is proposing that Member States grant decoupled support to vine growers under the direct payments scheme. In practical terms, that will allow Member States to transfer funds from the wine envelope to the common agricultural policy (CAP) direct payments scheme (first pillar). That is positive, as the payments will now be granted for an indefinite period, which will allow small farmers to predict their incomes over the period and therefore gain stability. The introduction of this mechanism will, however, require some adjustments. This resolution will allow Member States to test this new mechanism for a period of one year prior to its definitive implementation, if they so desire. That is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this resolution which makes recommendations for improving animal welfare in Europe. Despite the fact that unfortunately it does not call clearly for a reduction in transport time, it does limit the duration of transport of live animals to eight hours as requested in a recent petition on this matter. Similarly, the text calls for the inclusion of animal welfare standards in trade agreements signed by the EU. Although this resolution is not perfect, it is a first encouraging sign which, I hope, will lead to a genuine proposal for a regulation from the Commission. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 The Council conclusions are mixed. Symbolically, they point towards greater solidarity and integration, the only means of tackling this interminable economic crisis, which is a good thing. However, only around 10 billion of the 120 initially promised by the Compact for Growth and Jobs are genuinely new and additional funds. Furthermore, the conclusions still have ‘growth’ as their leitmotiv. This is seen as the sole remedy to all our economic ills. This rhetoric is unacceptable as far as we, as ecologists, are concerned. What we should be questioning is our model of development as a whole and we should bear in mind the fact that resources are finite. The conclusions of the Summit do not do this, or do it very little. Given these mixed findings, I abstained from voting on this resolution. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I signed this resolution calling for all public consultations to be translated into all of the languages recognised by the countries of the European Union. There is a European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that calls for resolute action to be taken to promote these languages, to prohibit any form of discrimination against them and even to facilitate and encourage their use in public life. This resolution responds precisely to this last point. Such a measure would encourage citizens to address the European Union. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 We have been asked to express an opinion on reprioritising our development cooperation with Latin America. I voted in favour of Mr Cortés Lastra’s report as it highlights the need to move towards renewed cooperation with Latin America. This is a chance for the EU to stop with the neoliberal policies of the past. Promoting growth does not provide prosperity for all. Social cohesion is key to this process. Growth and the fight against poverty cannot be systematically linked. The EP will soon be questioned about its approval of the free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru and on the association agreement with Central America. They go completely against the objectives of our development policy. The European Commission has always mistakenly interpreted development policy through the prism of international trade. It is time we turned this logic on its head and focused mainly on coherent development policies in any agreement. The report rightly points out the need for all EU policies to be coherent and for systematic compliance with environmental and social standards, while including civil society.

 As regards this road map for energy cooperation with third countries, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance succeeded in having a number of amendments incorporated, notably on reducing dependence on imports through greater input from renewable energies, the need to align the long-term climate and energy policy objectives, the need to ensure sustainable energy supply at local level in developing countries, and the need to be more sceptical about the use of agrofuels. However, I could not vote for this report, which promotes shale gas and oil sands and which supports projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

 I co-signed and voted for this resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe as it was essential for us to send out a strong message against the homophobic laws that have been recently adopted, or are in the process of being adopted in certain countries, particularly at the very heart of Europe, where homosexuality is criminalised. The European Parliament, as a great defender of fundamental rights, had a duty to examine and condemn these extremely worrying laws that demonstrate the increasing homophobia that can be seen today in Europe. It is utterly scandalous that the authorities should justify these laws by saying that they are necessary to protect public morality, while they restrict freedom of expression and are totally discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. How is it possible to consider demonstrations, support for, or the mere acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as ‘homosexual propaganda’? For the first time since the last European elections, all of the main political groups have come to an agreement: we are saying ‘no to homophobic laws’ and we clearly condemn any discrimination, hate speech or violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

 We had the opportunity to prevent the disappearance of bluefin tuna, and the EU, the main exploiter of this species, also had the opportunity to assume its responsibilities. It is regrettable, however, that the European Parliament did not succeed in adopting more ambitious measures to address the plight of this iconic endangered species. The new legislation, which I certainly could not vote against, is only the bare minimum, but it will at least make it possible to enforce existing international standards. Although the European Union has just complied with the commitments made within the framework of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), we are still far from taking the necessary measures. Measures should have been taken, for example, to close zones to fishing, especially during the spawning season. In addition, stricter measures should have been adopted concerning illegal fishing and overfishing in particular, in order to fill certain gaps, which are currently exacerbating the problem of the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It may not be too late, and the EU will once again have the opportunity to enforce more stringent regulations this November. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted for this report recommending the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) at EU level and therefore supporting the draft directive presented by the Commission last September. The FTT is an excellent instrument for raising new revenue to finance stimulus policies. It is one of the best ways of going beyond the austerity policies that are leading Europe straight into disaster, driving too many of Europe’s citizens into poverty and leading to political and democratic stalemate, the magnitude of which is still not being acknowledged by some. However, I regret that the European Parliament has granted an exemption to pension funds. It is the wrong signal, especially since these funds – which are long-term investors – are only marginally affected by the tax, which mostly penalises short-term players. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

 I voted against this report, as it calls for special attention and financial support for regional airports, without a single condition with regard to security or even the environment. Before the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed various amendments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving multimodality (better coordination with rail transport) and developing better cooperation between regional airports that are geographically close to each other but are situated in different (cross-border) countries. These amendments were all rejected, leaving me with no choice but to vote against the report. Catherine Grèze  (Verts/ALE

Whilst the remit and functions of the European Environment Agency may not be on a par with those of other agencies for whom a postponement of discharge has been requested, it does have the task of providing reliable, independent information on the environment.

That is why I voted in favour of postponing discharge. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Amazonian countries are confronted with illegal mining, which is synonymous with the ecological and social violation of indigenous territories, with tragic consequences. At the end of August, Survival
, an NGO, provided information concerning the massacre by miners of several dozen Yanomami Indians on Venezuelan territory. Today, however, the Venezuelan Government believes there to be no evidence. Since then, voices have been raised, including that of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, denouncing the lack of will on the part of local authorities to conduct an investigation and calling for an in-depth investigation. I hope that the European Union will expressly call on the Venezuelan Government to shed light on this tragedy to the fullest extent. However, those of us who are directly concerned, through our overseas territories, send a strong message calling for the full recognition of the rights of indigenous people. Starting today, let us put an end to the illegal exploitation of mineral and forest resources. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 days ago, we were hoping that Rio+20 would be the summit that would destabilise those who profit from greater inequality and deplete our resources. We are bitterly disappointed at the lack of binding objectives. However, this should not divert us from our commitments. If we want to see future progress in the negotiations, we need to prove that the fight against poverty and for sustainable development is the true objective of EU development policy, and we need to do so through the allocation of ambitious financial resources. Let us make a commitment to implement, without delay, innovative financing mechanisms, such as the financial transaction tax, and to redirect a substantial proportion of revenues towards development aid. Let us fight more effectively against tax havens and their hoarding of the fiscal resources of those countries through the excessive use made of them by transnational corporations and, in particular, the extractive industries. Only then can we become credible advocates of sustainable development for all. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some satisfaction that I present this report on tax and development to you tonight. It represents an important stage in a battle that began a long time ago, which I am now pursuing in the European Parliament. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Development, with whom the work has been extremely productive. I hope that it will find confirmation during tomorrow’s votes. Developing countries have been very badly hit by the financial and economic crisis and the rising prices of agricultural materials and now need substantial new sources of funding more than ever. Amid this context of global crisis, tax revenue, which is the oldest source of development funding, is a major issue and a genuine challenge. Effective taxation systems not only provide funding for vital public services. By promoting the transparent, responsible use of government revenue, they are also one of the foundations of a responsible democracy. Contributing towards raising equitable, progressive and transparent taxes should in no way lead to removing or reducing official development assistance (ODA). It should not provide a further excuse for Member States that are increasingly inclined to reduce their share of GDP which is devoted to ODA. Whilst ODA may be imperfect and have much room for improvement, it is no less vital for countries that have been severely affected by both economic and climate-related crises. It is not a question of replacing aid, therefore, but of redirecting it towards developing effective taxation systems, to which the multinationals must contribute on the basis of their actual profits. In this way, poor countries will be able to take ownership of their development once again, reduce poverty and compensate for the loss of customs revenue caused by the liberalisation of the markets, so that in the long term, they will be able to manage without foreign aid. However, the countries of the South are not only victims of their own ineffective taxation systems. They are also victims of the tax dumping imposed by the Bretton Woods bodies, of the cost of illicit capital flight, and of tax havens. Every year, they sustain colossal losses of tax revenue estimated at over ten times the amount of aid they receive from rich countries. This report emphasises this fact. As for the OECD guidelines, far from being adequate, they actually pose a threat. By allowing non-cooperative jurisdictions to be taken off the grey lists simply by signing cooperation agreements without imposing any automatic exchange of information, they are creating the illusion that tax havens are legitimate and conferring credibility on a system that is harmful to public finances in North and South alike. Putting an end to tax havens is a vital step towards these countries’ development, and the European Union must make it an absolute priority. The EU must shoulder its responsibilities as the United States has done and produce clear, binding legislation coupled with genuine sanction mechanisms in order to put an end to tax havens, which are like weapons of mass destruction for the development of poor countries. The EU must prevent profit and transfer price manipulation by companies, especially European companies, which both benefit from and abuse detrimental taxation systems. It must impose the introduction of a transparent, binding international mechanism that will place a duty on all multinational companies, especially those in the extractive industries, to automatically declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. This is a vital first step towards stopping those who are getting rich on the back of the Southern countries’ misery. It is also a vital step towards restoring the European Union’s credibility. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these partnership agreements between the European Union, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo should, in principle, turn out to be good news for these populations, and good news for biodiversity. However, this is only one stage in a long process which the European Parliament will follow closely. If we want this agreement to allow for the introduction of a regulated, transparent and environmentally friendly timber trade which benefits local populations, rather than a few groups of dubious legality, the European Union must ensure that the rights of the local and indigenous populations are fully respected and that the latter actually participate in the consultations. It must help strengthen the capabilities of all those involved; it must contribute to the fight against corruption and to the introduction of real forest governance. The agreements must not be a pretext for continuing to pillage the natural resources of developing countries. Rather, they must help restore a balance in relations between the European Union and these countries. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, following our visit to Gaza from 26-28 May 2010, our delegation unanimously called for an immediate, total and permanent lifting of the blockade imposed by Israel. Our joint resolution was born out of this unanimity faced with this humanitarian and political tragedy, and I hope that a large majority will vote for it. Conveying our message with one voice is not just necessary, it is vital, because it is precisely unity that the European Union has lacked until now and it is precisely unity that it needs today in order to carry weight and to make its presence felt as a major and credible actor for peace. For Europe, the worst thing would be if the flotilla tragedy were to be followed by indifference and inaction caused by a lack of unity. There needs to be a political reaction by Europe. It no longer simply has the right, but the duty, to act and hold talks as well as to condemn and impose sanctions when peace is threatened by one side or the other. Madam High Representative, we have a huge responsibility today. We can no longer content ourselves with reconstructing buildings time and again. We must build peace and we must do so now. That demands courage and firmness. You must build alliances, with the United States and Turkey in particular, and you must not relieve the diplomatic pressure on Israel until the complete lifting of the blockade and the setting up of an independent international inquiry become a reality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to Mr Domenici’s efforts, the report on which we have to take a final vote this week is a high quality document. I sincerely hope that it will be adopted on Wednesday at our plenary sitting. Many of the advances that it contains on the issues of financial transparency, fiscal policy and the fight against tax havens, the major consequences of which are rightly stressed here, are simply without precedent. First, we should welcome the fact that the text acknowledges the considerable limits of the fight against tax havens as it has been carried out until now. Tax treaties and the OECD lists of non-cooperative jurisdictions, to reproduce the terms officially in use, are unsatisfactory and even represent part of the problem that they are meant to be solving. That is why the proposals in this report, which aim to go beyond this approach, to adopt a new definition of tax havens and to introduce new tools – including sanctions − to help in this fight are hugely important. This is obviously the case for the proposal to introduce automatic exchange of tax information, both within the European Union and at international level. It is also the case for country-by-country accounting, which the report is demanding and which will make it possible to measure the real activities of companies in the countries in which they are established and to verify that they do indeed pay the taxes which they legitimately owe there. These are two fundamental demands which have long been supported by many experts. We can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is adopting them and, in so doing, will become one of the institutions that is most involved in this fight. Ladies and gentlemen, the problem of tax havens is not a mere technical issue. It relates to fundamental choices. Do we wish to give developing countries the means to benefit from their own resources instead of seeing these confiscated? Do we wish to ensure that all of our companies and our fellow citizens contribute within their means to the financing of civic life? By voting for Mr Domenici’s report, we will be giving a positive answer to these two questions. An answer of which, I believe, we can only be proud. On a personal level, I would like to thank Mr Kovács for the seminar that we jointly organised in Brussels on 9 December to put this subject on the agenda. Thank you and good luck. Eva Joly,

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this new humanitarian crisis that Haiti is enduring is perhaps on a greater scale than all previous ones, so much so that I doubt that it is possible to find the right words to talk about the victims, to speak to the survivors and to reach out to families in order to tell them how much we share their pain and are aware of our responsibility. However violent the earthquake was, it alone does not explain the extent of the damage. The latter is also linked to the chronic poverty that Haiti has endured for many years. Until now, the international community has been incapable of changing anything there. Worse, by imposing policies on Haiti that we now know did not work, international institutions, Europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric, its economy and its institutions. In the 1970s, Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned. It used to produce 90% of its agricultural needs. Today, it imports more than half. This must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production. Before this earthquake, Haiti was a country without resources because it was deprived of the resources to which it was entitled. We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies. From this point of view, we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place. In future, we must improve our procedures. However, we must, above all, be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong. We must proceed by calling our own methods into question, and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term. The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti, and the Member States have done the same. We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term, and EUR 200 million for long-term needs. I would like to compare these figures to other figures, to the USD 155 billion that the banks of the City and Wall Street are getting ready to pay to a few thousand people who work in the banks. That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level. Urgent humanitarian aid is necessary, but it alone is not enough. It must not, under any circumstances, supplant development aid, which itself must not be experienced by the countries that are supposed to benefit from it as a veritable diktat. The first way of assisting countries in great difficulty is to continue to respect them, to allow them to benefit from their own resources. We must cancel Haiti’s debt and pay off our debt to that country. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head. (Applause) Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face: the economic and financial crisis, the social or food crisis, climate change, energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty. The dominant economic model that is the unbridled free market, and our lifestyles, have not just shown their limitations, but have actually caused these unprecedented multidimensional crises. We must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies. The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision. The main imperative to respect is consistency. European Union trade policy, fisheries and agriculture must be designed consistently and in such a way as to ensure sustainable development, to fight poverty and guarantee a decent standard of living and income for everyone. I am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today. By making trade an end in itself, and not a means to serve its development policy, the European Union is sacrificing the populations of developing countries for the benefit of its multinationals. Therefore, negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements are quite rightly causing controversy amongst the governments of the ACP, unions and civil society, which see them as a threat to their economies. Agriculture is one of the most problematic issues and remains tragically neglected in cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries. Although rural areas and this sector represent more than 60% of the population and their jobs, their share of the European funds for ACP countries is virtually non-existent. This must change. How can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority? Agriculture must be at the heart of the European Union’s development policies. Helping developing countries together with local farmers to ensure they have food sovereignty is quite simply essential, all the more so because, today, food sovereignty, like the democratic legitimacy of these countries’ governments, is threatened by a new and particularly worrying phenomenon, the acquisition of arable land by foreign investors following the rise in food prices in 2007. China, Saudi Arabia and even Qatar now own thousands of hectares in developing countries. The European Union and the ACP countries must tackle this matter, which is likely to create violent conflicts and hunger riots, in particular, by making access to natural resources such as land and water a fundamental and inalienable right of local populations. Another matter that is close to my heart is that of tax havens. The repercussions of these are bad enough for developed countries, but are even worse for the economies and the political institutions of developing countries. The illicit financial flows that they allow are thought to account for as much as ten times the amount of official development assistance. Stopping this haemorrhage is a question of consistency and credibility. A first step could be the signing of a binding agreement, requiring multinationals to automatically declare their profits and the taxes paid in every country in which they operate, thus limiting the abuses and the losses sustained by developing countries. Finally, I would like to use this debate to stress once more the democratic deficit of this revision, which our parliaments were not consulted on. The role of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly must, however, be strengthened. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the negotiators will seize the opportunity they are being given to make the necessary amendments to this partnership and to make it a success of which the principal beneficiaries will be the populations of the ACP countries. Eva Joly,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Cotonou agreements, poverty has not subsided. We have therefore failed in our development mission. Something has to change with this second revision. I am pleased to say that there is a fairly broad consensus on the measures that I am proposing, and I think that one of the measures that we can use to eradicate poverty is to really combat tax havens, and to use this instrument to do what we can. Within the European Union and in the ACP region, we can force multinationals to declare, on a country-by-country basis, how much they earn and how much tax they pay. That is also an international demand. However, many years will go by before this demand is met at international level. So let us use the opportunities that we have within this agreement to establish this rule in Europe. This is why I am asking you to reject the proposed amendment to paragraph 16, but to preserve the initial wording, which calls on us to put our own house in order. In the same vein, what we can do is also force our own investment bank to take action with regard to tax havens. We should prohibit European Development Fund investments in companies that do not make profits in the countries in which they operate, but prefer to make profits in tax havens. This was the case in Zambia, where very substantial investments – to the tune of USD 46 million, I believe – were made in the Mopani mine, for example. This has done nothing to improve the lives of Zambians; rather, it has improved the lives of the shareholders who have benefited from this aid. It is therefore totally counterproductive. This is within our power. We can change the mandate of our bank. Let us therefore do what we can and put nothing off until tomorrow. Let us take action in this regard. Then, there are principles to which we should remain totally committed: human rights and migrant rights, and I urge you to retain my proposed wording of Article 31 and not quell the protests against bilateral agreements which, in reality, constitute an outsourcing of migratory flows. (Applause) Eva Joly,

Mr President, Mr Carlgren, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the world’s future will be at stake in Copenhagen, but before that, it is the credibility of the European Union, as the global leader in the fight against global warming, that will be at stake at the end of October in Brussels. The Member States must make climate-related financing proposals that are proportionate for a tragic situation. Together with the commitment – which I hope will be ambitious – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the issue of financing and of reducing and adapting to climate change in developing countries will represent a major theme in the forthcoming negotiations. The figures speak for themselves: 100 countries, most of them poor, account for only 3% of global emissions. Although developing countries have contributed the least to these greenhouse gas emissions, they are already the worst affected. According to a recent report by Oxfam, 26 million people have already been forced to migrate due to the effects of climate change or other forms of environmental damage. By 2050, these climate refugees could number more than 200 million. The effects of climate change could destroy the progress made in some developing countries and could quite simply prevent the Millennium Development Goals from being achieved. This is therefore not a question of charity. It is a question of us accepting our full responsibility and laying the foundations for a fair and peaceful world. The European Union’s current strategy is unworthy of the ambitions declared by the leaders of environmental diplomacy. It must lay its cards on the table now in order to relaunch the negotiations. The Union cannot reasonably pledge less than EUR 35 billion in public finances. It goes without saying that these funds can only supplement those already pledged for official development assistance, all the more so because the commitments made in this area are not always honoured by our Member States. Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of our planet is in our hands. If we do not stop the damage being done to our environment and the inequalities, we can fear the worst. We have a choice between an ambitious and proactive Europe and a timid Europe that is aligned with the United States, which cares little about the fate of developing countries. I urge you to make the right choice. Eva Joly,

Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, democracy and human rights are inextricably linked. It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised. We must therefore welcome the fact that, on 19 May, the Council indicated that the European Union had to adopt a more consistent approach to democratic governance. The efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a striking example of this. Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock. Where is the European Union’s consistency and credibility when its own decisions contrast so sharply with its much-vaunted principles? And what can be said of the Member States that refuse to endorse the Goldstone report? Its conclusions are fair and balanced, and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace. It is this hope that the major powers are destroying, and they are destroying it through their lack of courage and their lack of loyalty to their own values. Organising election observation missions is therefore not enough, especially when one refuses afterwards to acknowledge the result. We must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues. The Council should swiftly adopt a programme of action along these lines, with the creation of a genuine strategy for human rights, which would be imperative at all levels of the EU. We need to outline our priorities clearly and integrate them formally into all of our instruments: foreign policy, human rights policy and development policy. What kind of monitoring will we carry out in those third countries in which the European Union observes the elections in order to ensure respect for political pluralism and the involvement of civil society in the long term? What are our demands as regards the establishment of an independent judiciary and of institutions that are transparent and accountable to their citizens? The persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive. It is time to clear this up if we want the European Union and its most fundamental values to be taken more seriously at international level. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we wish the following phrase to be added to point A:  ‘as well as on the developing countries’, so that this reads ‘to analyse and evaluate the extent of the social, economic and financial crisis, its impact on the Union and its Member States, as well as on the developing countries’. Eva Joly  (Verts/ALE
).  
– Mr President, we also want to include a reference to ‘development cooperation’ so the sentence reads: ‘To analyse and evaluate the current implementation of Community legislation in all the areas concerned, including development cooperation’. We thought that the developing countries’ point of view was not reflected within the mandate. Eva Joly,

Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea. The violence that was used against the opponents and, in particular, women, is utterly appalling and unacceptable. I wish to express my support for the victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones’ remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre. In addition to the current measures being initiated by the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the Guinean Government by rejecting the Report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Guinea, which we will vote on during the next plenary session. The Committee on Development already unanimously rejected, in September, this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea, expressing doubts over the use of the funds allocated by the European Union. Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population, the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims’ wounds are still fresh. Doing so would send out the wrong message to the Guinean Government. It would be a scandal which I cannot bring myself to endorse. Eva Joly,

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, while I have the pleasure of putting this oral question to you on behalf of the Committee on Development, sadly I do not have the pleasure of presenting you with the resolution on the same subject, adopted unanimously by this committee. My colleagues from the Committee on Development and I worked tirelessly to ensure that the resolution was voted on and debated in plenary before the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. However, apart from my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, no other political group supported our request to put this resolution on the agenda, and yet it is vital if we want the European Parliament to play more of a part in defining the European Union’s external policy and to have real strength behind its proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, of what benefit will it be to us to vote on this resolution, which was to put the European Parliament’s requests and proposals to the members of the G20 and, more specifically, to those of our Member States who sit on it, as well as to the European Commission, at the October plenary session, that is, after the Pittsburgh Summit? Besides the fact that this devalues the work accomplished, we cannot be content with this role of current affairs commentator either. That is not our job. Let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism: journalists. Developing countries need us now more than ever. While our fellow citizens have not been spared, the global economic and financial crisis has had a far more lasting effect on the populations of developing countries. However, the financial institutions have not made these populations the main beneficiaries of the emergency loans, since very few of them satisfy the required conditions. The countries of Africa have thus received only 1.6% of the loans granted by the IMF since the last G20 meeting in London and the increase in the IMF’s resources. The rest has gone to developed countries, European ones in particular. Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course, but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility. Public development aid must be increased as a matter of urgency. Already, most of the Member States do not meet the conditions required by the OECD since 1970, and we are facing new emergencies without having new funds. We must therefore find new sources of funding, not least by reforming the current system. The Committee on Development is asking you to take action to eradicate tax haven abuses, tax evasion and the illegal flows of capital from developing countries. According to a Norwegian report published in June, the figures of which have been verified, the illegal flows leaving developing countries are ten times the amount of our development aid. This shows just how much is at stake. There is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay, on a country by country basis, in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate. Moreover, a radical reform of the system must take place involving, in particular, the introduction of new democratic and transparent regulations for trade and the international financial systems. The responsibilities are huge, the challenges many, and the task arduous, but, now more than ever, the European Union must step up to the plate and lead these reforms. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I will use the brief time I have available to express my group’s support for the report by Mr Ferreira. In our opinion, it has at least two advantages. Firstly, it focuses on a vital fishing sector that is often overlooked and sacrificed: small-scale, artisanal and coastal fishing, which is the sector in which most European vessels and fishermen operate. Secondly, this report puts the problem of small-scale fishing at the heart of the reform of the common fisheries policy. If, as we hope, the new fisheries policy is based on sustainable fishing criteria, the interests of artisanal fishermen will be guaranteed and consolidated. We will only be able to ensure the future of thousands of small-scale fishermen, and with them the global food supply to which they make a vital contribution, if we have a fisheries policy that is firmly focused on conserving marine resources, and protecting and renewing stocks. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, I have to say that I am fairly satisfied with Mrs Damanaki’s response on this issue of the consequences of rising oil prices for fishermen. This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity – and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay. We therefore cannot provide a short-term, circumstantial solution by increasing subsidies in line with the fluctuations in oil prices. This is a question of political logic. The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy. Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools. Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, on behalf of my three fellow Members, Mrs Pietikäinen, Mrs Sârbu and Mr Davies, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 410 Members of the European Parliament who signed Written Declaration 71/2010 on support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning, which we tabled. Indeed, this fragile species, like many others, is subjected to a veritable massacring at sea as a result of finning practices and the discarding of carcasses at sea following that mutilation. Thank you for having overwhelmingly signed this Written Declaration. It sends a strong signal to the Commission to bring about the strengthening of regulations to protect this species. (Applause) Jean-Paul Besset,

Mr President, I should like to focus my speech on Mr Luhan’s report. Regional cohesion policies have a key role to play in Europe for economic development that is balanced, socially harmonious and ecologically effective, that is, at the end of the day, globally competitive. I thank Mr Luhan for including some of our amendments aimed at establishing a sustainable low carbon economy which safeguards biodiversity. Nonetheless, we cannot vote for his resolution because it promotes a vision of cohesion policy as an instrument for global competitiveness that still appears to us to be too narrow, too restricted and inadequate. We must point out two sticking points. Firstly, the rapporteur relies almost exclusively on quantitative measures in terms of infrastructure as the driving force for growth, increase being his main criterion. We do not feel that is appropriate for the current situation. For example, he mentions 246 operational programmes in research and development and is proud of these, but without questioning what they are about. Research is a good thing but we also need to know what it is that we are researching. The second sticking point is that the rapporteur does not put forward sufficiently clear plans. We would have liked a robust choice in order to meet the challenges set out in his report, the choice of a green economy, of a green new deal which is the only choice capable of moving Europe and its regions upwards. Jean-Paul Besset  (Verts/ALE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to an aspect of this resolution, which is of central and not secondary importance to me, and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning. The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds. It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this ‘targeted approach to territorial development’, to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach. What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies? Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth. However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product. People’s well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve. If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view. To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions – which, I would point out, is our shared objective – the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres. It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment.

 Mr President, the rather forbidding title of Mr Sterckx’s report introduces a very important issue, which goes far beyond the administrative and technical matters that the title implies. It deals with an important political decision, namely, making the maritime transport sector more attractive, more efficient and more competitive. In our view, this is the sector of the future and provides the best means of transport from an environmental point of view. Mr Sterckx’s excellent report and the contributions of all the shadow rapporteurs will allow us to make significant progress in this field. From our point of view, this directive hits the mark: it will increase the level of harmonisation within the maritime transport sector, making it better coordinated and simplified. We will therefore wholeheartedly support this report when we vote on the matter, even though we would have liked to see it implemented faster and to see more strength of resolve with regard to the introduction of a common language in that sector. However, we think that the compromises achieved with the Council are still acceptable. We therefore unreservedly support this report. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, I agree with the content and conclusions in the report by my colleague and friend Mr Romeva i Rueda, and I welcome the collective work that has been done on this report. The report is based on a reality that is now unavoidable. Bluefin tuna is under threat of extinction as a species, and many fishermen, an important economic sector and a vital food resource for mankind are at risk along with it. I would like to emphasise what this situation will really mean and the shock it will cause in relation to the period in which we currently live. For it is indeed a shock. For the first time, there is a clear threat to a major consumer product that is known to all, available on supermarket shelves and consumed by us all. It is a clear signal: the sign of a change of era. Protecting bluefin tuna is now a major early warning sign from the environment, and the significance of that warning goes far beyond the single issue of bluefin tuna. The threat to fish stocks and their much-needed protection are now the symbol of humanity’s entry into a new era of scarce resources: fish resources, food resources and energy resources. The key words should no longer be waste, overproduction and overconsumption, but saving, sharing and caution. Jean-Paul Besset,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports Mr van Dalen’s report and recommendations. He offers us a balanced text which is the result of the close collaboration he managed to establish with the other political groups. We endorse this report because it clearly sets out the challenges facing the EU’s maritime policy, namely a significant increase in maritime traffic, both inside and outside the Union, without sacrificing the environment or social issues. This text is consistent with a rationale that we wish to see applied in all areas: a policy of sustainable development. It offers positive paths to allow maritime transport to develop between now and 2018 in the best possible conditions. In particular, we highlight the fight against abuses of flags of convenience or substandard vessels. We also highlight protection against piracy. We highlight having a policy designed within the framework of a single European sea, and the importance ascribed to the multimodal linking of European sea ports with the hinterland. We highlight the support for simplification of the administrative rules governing entry and exit from European ports. We highlight the promotion of maritime occupations and continuous training for them. Lastly, we highlight the priority given to environmental issues. On the whole, we will always support anything which, in our view, helps to promote a maritime transport sector which can compete with road and air transport. Mr van Dalen’s report has taken full stock of the global environmental challenge, for which maritime transport is one of the solutions. In particular, it is a useful tool against global warming. Our only regret is that the amendment that we tabled in order to integrate the maritime transport sector into the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system has not been taken up by the rapporteur or by the Commission. From our point of view, no economic sector should depart from the general rule, and, as with the air and road sectors, maritime transport, even if it is only responsible for low gas emissions, must do its part to reduce them. We will therefore be retabling our amendment to plenary. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, nobody has mentioned this yet, but something important happened on Sunday when the World Bank published its report and announced that the Earth will be more than four degrees warmer by 2060. Given that it is the World Bank saying this, I think it is safe to say that the situation is very serious. It means in practical terms that if we want to prevent this from occurring, we need to go from 35 billion cubic metres of CO2
 in 2050 to 10 billion. This requires very strict measures, not simply just to lower our emissions but to actually reduce them by a third or a half. This means that when we are dealing with this European and global issue today, we cannot simply chase after easily available energy sources if we want to avoid the effects of global warming. I say this because today everybody knows that methane has an effect on global warming 30 times greater than that of CO2
, and between 4 to 8 % of methane escapes between the wells and the pipes when extracting shale gas. This applies to all forms of methane, obviously. It is therefore a key issue. Finally, to give an example showing the need for European regulation, I went to visit a shale gas well near Wrocław in Poland operated by Halliburton. There was nothing to capture the water. Fracking had occurred and the water had just been released into the environment. That is why we need proper legislation and a moratorium while it goes through. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, we are currently experiencing a situation where production is increasing by more than 2.5%. At the same time, industrialists are lowering their prices. In Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and throughout European countries, prices are falling. This clearly means that prices are linked to production volumes and that we must organise production volumes as well as prices. At the same time, today, producers are falling victim to an increase of more than 44% in the price of vegetable proteins and 30% in the price of cereals. Parliament has already voted on the need to ensure that added value is distributed among producers and that farmers do not become the victims of companies and large-scale distribution. I would therefore ask the Commission today, but also the Council, to once again call into question controls on production, but at the same time, and I say this very clearly, Member States must get their own house in order because there are countries which have respected the quota rules and others which have not. This is another reason why these quotas have been called into question. There is therefore a double responsibility on the part of the Commission and the Member States. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Blue-card question.

Mr President, Mr Deß, I understand what you are saying and I am entirely in agreement with you. I have a very specific question on this subject. In the documents that I have managed to collect, I see that in Germany, while there are normally price negotiations between milk producers and buyers, industrialists, cooperatives and so on, Aldi – which is today a large-scale distribution group – has unilaterally decided to lower the price of a litre of milk by six cents. At the same time, all the other ‘hard discounters’ have just done the same thing. How do you explain the fact that, in Germany, large-scale distributors can set prices while, normally, according to the mechanisms put in place by the European Union, there ought to be discussions between industrialists and producers? We can clearly see that today there is a problem in the rules for setting milk prices. How do you explain this? José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I should like to speak about the issue of granting discharge to agencies and specifically, the European Food Safety Authority. More than two years ago, I questioned Mr Dali about a possible conflict of interest concerning the President of that agency, Ms Bánáti. It turned out that I was correct: yesterday, Ms Bánáti was forced to resign on the eve of the forthcoming vote. Since she resigned, she has been recruited as director of the largest international agri-food lobby, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which brings together all the companies in the sector. We now have a genuine problem. Everyone is aware of that, including the director of that agency herself. We need to take a close look at the issue of conflicts of interest and the transparency of assessments. The same goes for medicines. Today, I am asking to postpone the vote on the discharge, not for financial reasons, but, very specifically, to ask the Commission to introduce clear rules in favour of transparency and against conflicts of interest.

Blue-card answer.
 – (FR)
 I think that this is a positive move, but it is not enough. We need clear rules. We do not, however, have clear rules on conflicts of interest at the moment, not only for the appointment of management boards, but also for the appointment of experts. That is why I think that we have to take our time. If we refuse to grant this discharge, we shall have an historic opportunity to create transparency so that there can be no ambiguity about these agencies. I am in favour of the agencies and their development, and also of an increase in their state funding to avoid conflicts of interest with the private sector. I am campaigning today to strengthen the agencies, but that can only be done by combating conflicts of interest and ensuring transparency. José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, let me make a statement of fact: our citizens increasingly want to find and consume locally produced and seasonal food, for health and quality reasons in particular. We have to find ways to enable farmers to meet this growing demand effectively and quickly. We have to support the establishment of local infrastructure for producers, such as maintaining local abattoirs which, while guaranteeing rigorous sanitary control, facilitate the development of local short food supply chains and strengthen direct selling. Support for local agriculture and direct selling should help producers sell their products and bring them to the attention of consumers. Stronger direct relations will enable farmers to retain more of the added-value created on their farms. Direct selling within the farm must be promoted and facilitated and support must be given to the collective actions of farmers who want to open collective points of sale enabling them to offer local consumers a wider range of products. The Commission must facilitate the emergence, sustainability and development of systems of selling through direct delivery to consumers, such as the Associations for the Preservation of Smallholdings (AMAP) in France, which enable approximately 3 000 farmers to supply 60 000 families. Finally, Member States must be able to add other criteria concerning, in particular, the size of the farm, the volume of production or the traditional character of the product in order to define local agriculture.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. I simply want to say that the report on the free trade agreement bears my name, and as there has been a vote in favour of the agreement within the framework of the Committee on International Trade, the report continues to bear my name, and I urge you to vote against this report. Those who are against this agreement should vote no, not yes. I just wanted to clarify that. José Bové,

 Mr President, in view of the outcome, I submit to the majority and withdraw my name, of course. In any case, I wish to thank all my colleagues in Parliament who have taken part in the debate, because it is very important to have held a debate on international trade for the first time. We need to continue along those lines. I hope the Commission will take into account the debates that have taken place. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, there are some saying today that this project has nothing to do with the common agricultural policy. I tell you this is not the case. What is now very clear is that the objective of the common agricultural policy was to ensure food security, to make sure that products are affordable for all consumers, ensuring farmers’ income. Feeding all the citizens of Europe is therefore part of the fundamental charter of the first integrated European policy. When we can now transfer money from the CAP balance to fund the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) to the tune of almost EUR 500 million, how is it that, in some States, some are questioning the EUR 500 million to help the poor? We have now reached an agreement until 2014. I think that after this, there will need to be a link between the CAP and welfare systems to ensure that the poorest have access to this food. We are committed to this and I hope that in terms of agricultural policy, special efforts will be made so that the poorest can also directly access production. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Nicholson on the courage he displayed when facing the Council and the Commission. Nevertheless, I fear that the end result does not strike a balance between producers and manufacturers. This agreement reminds me of the children’s tale about a paradise where vegetarian lions would lie down with lambs and eat grass. I do not believe it for a second! From 2003 Ms Fischer Boel did everything in her power to destroy the milk quotas from an ideological perspective. In October 2009, despite these efforts, the Court of Auditors recognised the effectiveness of the milk quotas. Today, however, we find ourselves in a situation that is going to be even worse and we can see what is already happening in Denmark, where the most solid farms, with rising production, are all going bankrupt, with a 40% reduction in land prices. Do we want to see the same thing right across Europe? Surely not! We need to control production with the participation of the public authorities. José Bové,  
rapporteur
. − (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU–Morocco agreement encourages both sides of the Mediterranean to concentrate on capital-intensive corporate farms at the expense of family and peasant farming. The rise in the number of quotas at reduced rates for a wide range of fruit and vegetables makes it difficult for EU producers to continue to compete, but at the same time does not help the development of balanced agriculture in Morocco. Labour costs are the principal factor determining the price of fruit and vegetables. Morocco has an undeniable advantage today due to the widespread use of child labour and the ban on agricultural workers forming trade unions. Workers in Morocco earn around EUR 5 per day, compared with EUR 50 in Spain. How can we cope with this type of competition and this social dumping? Respect for trade union rights and a ban on child labour are essential preconditions for ratification of a new trade agreement with Morocco. The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is a cause for concern among EU producer organisations. The problems with the system allow operators to reduce the import duties they pay. The European Commission has never equipped itself with the means to combat this type of fraud and it needs to resolve this issue before proposing a new agreement. In Morocco the way in which export quotas are managed favours large groups. In the tomato sector 70% of Moroccan exports come from just three groups. Moroccan family-run farms do not benefit from this agreement. According to a study funded by the European Union, the Abu Dhabi Tiris Euro Arab investment fund obtained 700 000 hectares in the south of Morocco to plant and harvest citrus fruits, olives and market-garden crops. The monopolising of land, which is so shocking to our fellow citizens, is also happening on a large scale in Morocco. In the Souss region, where tomato growing is concentrated, the water table is falling by two metres per year. In Western Sahara agri-businesses are drawing on coastal ground water. This irrigation results in the salinisation of fresh water, jeopardising the local population’s drinking water supply. Exporting 350 000 tonnes of tomatoes is equivalent to exporting 35 million cubic metres of water from Morocco to Europe. The social, environmental and economic effects have not been assessed by the Commission. We are still waiting for the impact study. A study is required to allow Parliament to reach a decision in full knowledge of the facts. We have never allowed an agreement to be adopted before identifying its social, economic and environmental repercussions. I have raised the question of the territorial scope of the EU–Morocco agreement. A number of countries, including the United States, have signed free trade agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco that expressly excluded Western Sahara. This was done so as not to influence the outcome of international negotiations being held under the aegis of the United Nations to enable the various parties to find a peaceful settlement. As the Commission and Parliament’s Legal Service hold diverging views on this issue, we cannot guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that this free trade agreement will comply with the international treaties that are binding on the European Union and all of its Member States. Consequently, the European Parliament should reject the agreement. That will enable us to reopen the negotiations on a new footing. I think that it will also send a strong message to the Commission to change its working method by allowing the European Parliament to participate from the initial stages of the discussions among the parties. The European Commission must produce concrete, serious impact studies on the economic, social, environmental and budgetary effects of the agreements it is negotiating. We can no longer accept the fact that Parliament only has the option of saying yes or no. I must inform you that, contrary to the opinion adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which opposes the agreement, the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade is to approve the agreement between the European Union and Morocco. I am bound to state that publicly. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the arguments that I have just set out, you will no doubt realise that I am asking you very clearly to vote against the conclusion of this agreement. This is not just in the interests of European farmers, who are unanimously opposed to the agreement right across the trade union spectrum, but also, and above all, it is in the interests of Moroccan farmers, who are today being deprived of their land by large exporter groups and who, because of this unbalanced agreement, are going to have their meat, dairy and cereal production capacity destroyed by imports by large European groups. I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject this agreement, which is a bad agreement. By rejecting it, we will reopen the debate but we will not prevent the previous agreement from continuing. It is thus simply the extension of the agreement that I am asking you to reject, in the interests of farmers on both sides of the Mediterranean. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, we have just had a debate that, in spite of everything, was interesting because for the first time it was a real debate on a free trade agreement. Some people referred to the facts, others to ideology, even belief, belief in free trade as a stepping stone to democracy. I hope that those people do not find themselves one day in a situation where they have to face the people who have suffered because of free trade agreements, of any kind: today the peasant farmers who produce fruit and vegetables, or tomorrow the meat producers when it is time for the Mercosur agreement. I believe that this free trade agreement is a bad agreement, especially for Morocco’s peasant farmers. If the ‘yes’ vote prevails on Thursday – which is of course possible as I do not know what will happen – it will mean that you are creating all of the conditions for the Arab Spring to arrive finally in Morocco. That means that you will be in a bit of a strange situation tomorrow. In fact, the agreement provides for an increase of more than 50% for European products on Moroccan territory, compared with just 15% for Moroccan products in Europe, which means that hundreds of thousands of Moroccan families are going to be thrown out on the street because of these exports to their country. Is that what you want? I get the impression today that you are not talking about the reality. You refuse to talk about the reality. We are accepting this agreement because Morocco is promising to protect us from the immigration from Africa. That is what is happening and it also features in all of your texts. Are we concluding economic agreements solely to build a wall on the other side of the Mediterranean to protect Europe? We have to get serious! We have to get back to the actual facts, and the actual facts all come down to agriculture. However, this agreement is a bad plan for agriculture. A 1% increase in volume over what is offered could lead to prices collapsing. As you are all too aware, Commissioner, the balance between supply and demand is very fragile. A 1% adjustment can make prices collapse and have devastating consequences. We know that Perpignan is currently a key transit point for tomatoes. We know that the head offices of the two largest firms, Azura and Idyl, are located in France. We know that today. So why are we continuing in this manner? We also know that the Commission has internal EU documents that show that more than 700 000 hectares were given to the Persian Gulf fund. You cannot deny that today; it is the Commission’s own documents that prove it. We need to get serious when it comes to the issue of water, too. We are told today that there is no information about water, even though European universities, in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, in addition to Moroccan universities are providing figures. I do not need to say any more. As regards our obligation to Western Sahara, I did not want to turn it into a political battle, but simply to raise a point of law. Indeed, the law is clear-cut. If Western Sahara is not excluded from this agreement tomorrow, you could face the possibility of action before the European Court of Justice. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2010, Parliament adopted the report by the Committee on Agriculture aimed at ensuring fair revenues for farmers. In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other. The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work. On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation. The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources. European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products. We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production. In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions. Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances. However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc. The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves. Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP. The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm. Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource. This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing. Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers! José Bové,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important. The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain. Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial. Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, now that this text has been adopted, I think that it is important to point out that a collective effort was made on the part of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and that, thanks to this collective effort, we shall be able to step up the pressure on the Commission and the Council to ensure that, finally, farmers in Europe are taken into consideration, both in terms of their costs and their income. I should therefore like to thank this Assembly for that and to thank my fellow Members who helped me draw up this report, in particular, Mr Lorensen. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not want to repeat what everyone has already said, but I believe that, today, Europe does in fact have a real problem of credibility as a result of what is happening. We are being put on trial. We are being told, on the one hand, that there is the European policy and, on the other, that there is the policy of the Member States. However, if the Treaty of Rome of 1958 tells us that we must ensure that all Europeans are fed and that we must guarantee food security, this is a European policy. It is not a policy of the Member States Today, this situation shows, in addition to the selfishness of a number of Member States, that what is lacking is not more Europe but rather a European will on the part of a number of Heads of State or Government. At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the European Commissioner, Mr Cioloş, who, in an opinion piece published in the Le Monde
 newspaper, had the courage to say that this policy was essential for the poorest Europeans. If we are incapable of challenging the decision of the Council, Europe will be disowned by its citizens. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Prime Minister, I wanted to speak as we met in your country, in Warsaw, with the delegation from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, when we decided to speak on a number of very specific issues. It was pointed out, with regard to climate, that the Polish Presidency was somewhat cautious and did not want to make this issue a priority, as the Durban climate change conference is taking place at the end of the year. The European Parliament has very clearly stated the need to reduce CO2
 emissions by 25% or even by 30%. Yet, when it comes to environmental safety, I unfortunately do not sense the same will from you as you asserted this morning – which I was pleased to hear – regarding energy security and food security. Environmental security seems to be just as fundamental to me and we will not have one without the other. I think this is a central point. On food security, I would like your Presidency to be more active. Yesterday, the European Parliament said very clearly that countries should have the right to opt out of cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Unfortunately, while we were voting on that, you changed the law in Poland on 1 July to allow GMOs in, under pressure from Mr Barroso. I would like you to enable this procedure in order to ensure that countries have the right to resist, as you have done for many years. Another point, now, at the end of the year … (The President interrupted the speaker)
 … the meeting of energy ministers is going to take place; I would like you to take into account the requirement to have a policy for a moratorium on shale gas. (Applause) José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lepage, I think that the rapporteur has tried to do the best she could do in a bad situation. The European Commissioner has presented a proposal for renationalisation, which has been a total failure from a legal point of view, because, as we have seen, the legal services of Parliament and of the Council said that this solution was contrary to competition law and would pose major problems at an international level. So proposing to Member States now that this debate can be taken up again without a clear legal basis will create more problems than it will solve. I will be brief. Commissioner, what I want to hear from you today is a very clear statement on whether you will commit yourself to integrating into European legislation the rules that will be adopted by Parliament in the context of the revision of the directive on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). José Bové  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do agree that, as well as liberty and fraternity, there should be equality for farmers and the new Member States in Eastern Europe. Yes, I agree with you. I think that this report marks a huge step forward. It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational. However, the important thing is that we reached a consensus. This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision, and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament’s great strength. We have succeeded, despite the difficulties, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and all the Members. The first phase is complete. In this document, we have reiterated the need for equality, justice and fairness for producers and regions. I think that is important. We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms, that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity. In my opinion, this was another fundamental point. The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts. We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations. This is not a question of ideology. Lastly, at present, we are worried about the real budgetary threats. We need to come up with unequivocal responses. What we want now is to move into the second phase, which is obviously the legislative debate. Why? Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going. That is essentially what we are waiting for. Let me close, however, by expressing my fury at Germany’s attitude. It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe’s poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount. That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget. I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat. José Bové,

 Madam President, Commissioner, as in 2008, the price of agricultural raw materials is soaring on world markets. We are only at 3% of the 2008 level. The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission. The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day. Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line. Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States? Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets. This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators. The impact is also dramatic for European farmers. They are no longer able to feed their animals. Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300. This is a whole new ball game. The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well, today, to follow its own advice. Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions. The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions. Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price. Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices. Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming. José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, a year ago, you told me that GMOs had polluted your first term of office and that you wanted to refer the issue back to the Member States. A few days ago, 1 200 000 signatures were collected from European citizens asking for an independent expert report on GMOs. A few days ago again, the Environment Council rejected Commissioner Dalli’s proposal by a very large majority. The opinions of both Council’s and Parliament’s legal advisers have also been negative. Lastly, you have witnessed the scandal at EFSA with the Banati affair and the questions raised by the panel. What is more, EFSA itself has decided to issue new assessment guidelines. What I would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations, such as that of MON810, until the new EFSA rules have come into force? New assessments and authorisation renewals should be processed according to the new rules. Finally, are you willing to relaunch the debate so that we can get an independent assessment? José Bové,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
 – (FR)
 Thank you for your answer. However, EFSA has already put in place new guidelines that are much stricter. Are you willing to agree that all new authorisations that have been granted over this latest period and the issue of MON810 should be reviewed in the light of these new guidelines? We cannot accept assessments today that were carried out on the basis of old rules. That is why I am asking you this question very precisely and I would like you to start this whole debate again from scratch, instead of waiting until 2012. Directive 2001/18/EC is due to be updated in 2012: the process needs to be brought forward. José Bové,

Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago. Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month. Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe’s small-scale agriculture before we act? Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo – is that right? On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers. It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price. The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers’ organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors. Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility. Next week, Commissioner Cioloş will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers. Europe’s credibility is at stake. Europe needs every single one of its farmers. José Bové,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, for their support in this task. This report, like the one by Mr Lyon, is part of our major debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We have managed to reach a large number of compromises, which have been adopted by a large majority in our group – by 32 votes to 4. I believe that our message to the Commission is a powerful one: we all want greater transparency in the food chain and legislation that guarantees fair competition between farmers and all operators in the food chain. We also want concrete measures, in Europe and elsewhere, to combat speculation and abuses of market power and to safeguard farmers’ revenues. I am surprised that, on the initiative of one or two political groups in this House, we are being asked to vote tomorrow on a long list of separate votes, which go against the powerful and consensual message that we adopted by a large majority in committee. Could it be that events over the summer have made you change your minds? I rather think that the intense lobbying carried out in recent days by the large-scale distribution sector and certain operators in the agri-food industry is the reason for the excessive number of separate votes. In any case, I cannot imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that you would give in to such pressure in order to weaken our common message. Our committee has taken stock of the crisis affecting European farmers. It intends to propose concrete, strong measures: in less than 10 years, the Union has lost 3.5 million farming jobs. It is a massacre on a terrible scale. Bulgaria, for example, has lost one in two farmers. In 2009, revenues plummeted. In France and Germany, farmers have lost 20% of their revenue on average, and in Hungary, they have lost more than 35%. Farming and rural communities are in danger of disappearing. Forced as it was by the exasperation of farmers and by the demonstrations of dairy cattle breeders, in December 2009, the European Commission published a communication entitled, ‘A better functioning food supply chain in Europe’. The latter shows that, between 1995 and 2005, the proportion of the added value of the food chain that went to agricultural producers decreased from 31% to 24%. The prices paid to farmers are falling in virtually every sector, without European consumers benefiting as a result. The Commission says that these problems are linked to increased concentration in the wholesale, processing and distribution sectors, which impose their will on unorganised producers. The Commission is concerned about the lack of transparency in relation to pricing and margins. It recognises the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data, and admits that it does not have the information it needs to adapt its policies quickly and effectively. To remedy this, I propose that the Commission creates a European farm prices and margins observatory, on the model of that which exists in the United States. This body will be responsible for defining European farmers’ production costs. It will tell us the real costs of a litre of milk, a kilo of wheat or a kilo of beef from the moment it leaves the farm. This information will serve as a basis for negotiations between farmers and the other operators in the food chain. This body will also be responsible for assessing which sectors claim all the added value, to the detriment of producers and consumers. The European Commission would thus be able to identify which operators are abusing the balance of power and abusing their dominant position. It also seems crucial to make the 20 largest European companies draft an annual report on their market share and the internal margins they generate. Transparency poses no threat to the market economy. On the contrary, it is an absolute necessity in order to prevent the abuses that have been observed in agriculture and in many other sectors, in particular, that of finance. Who can claim that, when farmers sell their milk or their meat, they are on an equal footing with multinationals, which influence commodity price building on the global markets? The balance of power is completely unbalanced, and some would say unfair. In order to restore the balance, a first emergency measure would be to allow farmers to come together within producers’ organisations. The second, additional measure involves prohibiting selling of goods below purchase price at Community level. Forced discounts, subsequent alterations to contract terms, and unjustified listing fees are a common occurrence. They are hitting farmers and the thousands of small and medium-sized processing companies hard, because they have to go through the large-scale distribution sector in order to sell their products. The European Commission must take stock of the extent of these anti-economic practices, and it must take the measures required to stop them. Lastly, speculation on agricultural commodities is a scourge. Financiers and speculators are looking for instant rewards and instant profits. For them, poverty, hunger and famine are synonymous with profits. We did not think that we would relive the 2008 riots, but we could not have been more mistaken. Since June, the price of wheat has risen by more than 70%. The prices of maize, soya and rice are also on the increase. Last week, seven people were killed in Maputo, Mozambique, for demonstrating against the 30% increase in food prices. Are we going to continue to stand by and do nothing, as we did two years ago? Are we going to continue to put up with investment banks bankrupting European farmers and crushing the men and women of our planet? I call on the European Union to take the initiative to create a global agency to regulate the markets. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to send out a strong message so that the new CAP is fairer for European farmers and consumers and so that there is fair competition between operators which allows for the creation of a framework for regulating the markets and which gives short shrift to speculators. It is the responsibility of the European Parliament, as it prepares to exercise its joint decision-making power in agricultural matters, not to submit to any pressure, from wherever it may come. Our message must remain clear and consistent. José Bové,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I am pleased with the debate that we have just had, in which a very large number of Members were able to speak. It is true that, at this time, on the first day of the part-session, there are rather too many of us for this debate, which shows just how interested all of the groups are in the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The important thing for me is that the report that we have debated, the text that is going to be voted on tomorrow in this House, is a joint text. This has been mentioned by a number of speakers. I am the rapporteur, but this text has been drafted jointly within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I think that that is very important. Everyone came with his or her own idea or story, and we came up with this proposal together. I feel it is important to emphasise this. It is my name that appears on this report, but it is a joint report, and I wanted to reiterate that. Several speakers stressed the need to safeguard farmers’ incomes through the sale of their agricultural products. That is the very foundation of agriculture. Farmers are paid from the sale of their products, and so to say that, today, farmers cannot sell below production cost is an essential, indispensable condition if we are to continue to have farmers in Europe in the future. Agricultural policy makes it possible to support, to maintain agricultural activity across regions, and to combat distortions linked to natural handicaps or to the regions. Therefore, the fact is that there will be no common agricultural policy if farmers cannot earn a living from their production in the first place. Farmers are the ones making the strongest calls in this regard, and Parliament has just successfully repeated their demands. The second point that I feel emerged clearly from our debate just now is the need for transparency all along the food chain. All the speakers came back to this point at various levels, in particular, with regard to the processing sector in negotiations with producers, or with the large-scale distribution sector, which, often, for example in the case of fruit and vegetables, creams off unbelievable profits. Today, all that is acknowledged; this need is no longer in doubt. Many speakers also focused on the issue of speculation; I am not going to go back over it. Therefore, I would say that, once the vote has been held tomorrow in plenary – and I believe that all the speeches have demonstrated the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s collective will to table this report and to convince all of our fellow Members – once the text is adopted, once it is voted for tomorrow, the ball will be in the Commission’s court. Moreover, I should like to say to the Commissioner: it is now up to you to take action. This is an initiative that we are taking. We are making proposals to you. Our expectation, of course, is that this work will now be taken up by the Commission and the Council, since it is clear that Parliament alone will be unable to do anything. On the other hand, by working together, we will be able to build a new common agricultural policy. Above all, however, we will be able to give hope to European farmers. José Bové  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, first of all I would obviously like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lyon, with whom I believe we all worked on the basis of mutual agreement to try to move forward, and I would like to say briefly, in just a few words, that the evidence is there for us to see. The evidence is that, today, Europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials. We must have an ambitious agricultural and food policy so that we can ensure that our citizens’ food needs are met. Furthermore, today we have a CAP that must be reformed for three reasons. It is a CAP that is unfair, economically, socially and environmentally. Economically: the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must allow for this problem to be resolved. Socially: aid is unfairly distributed between countries, regions and farmers. Eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20% of farmers. Environmentally: we need a CAP which respects the soil, which respects … (The President cut off the speaker) José Bové,

Mr President, Commissioner, reopening negotiations with Mercosur when the European Union is getting ready to redefine its agricultural policy reveals a dangerous lack of consistency on the part of the Commission. Europe already imports 500 000 tonnes of beef. Opening up our market even further would be to the disadvantage of the cattle breeders of Europe’s less-favoured areas, without any guarantee of respect for health and social standards. We cannot accept this. Europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle. These imports from Brazil and Argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares. They are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises: Cargill, ADM and Bunch. Between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1.2 million hectares of tropical and equatorial forest. It is one of the principal causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity. The European Parliament has decided to produce a report on the recovery of autonomy in respect of vegetable proteins for livestock feed. This decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change. These efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement. Once again the European Commission is selling short its farming and its farmers in order to obtain chance gains for service companies. These concessions will not serve the interests of the farming families of Mercosur, only those of agro-industrial groups. Convincing evidence of this can be found in the report by the Tyson group, a US corporation and heavyweight in the international meat market, which announced that it has invested in Brazil – I quote, and it is in its report – to use this country as a platform for exporting to Europe. Other enterprises, such as the Doux Group, had already anticipated this move by buying out the Brazilian Frangosul Group in 1998. Many poultry farmers, particularly in Brittany, paid the price for that deal. Europe seems to want to pursue its policy of relocation by intensifying its attacks against farmers. We must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality, locally produced food. José Bové,

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against hunger demands a substantial political and financial investment. The Food and Agricultural Organisation was unable to generate that investment last week in Rome, and I regret that. More than a billion people suffer from malnutrition and 40 million men, women and children die of hunger each year. These dramatic figures have risen since 1996, the year of the first World Food Summit. The global financial and economic crisis has aggravated the situation, and the populations of the countries of the South are the main victims. Ten per cent of the advertising budget worldwide would allow developing countries to be given the necessary support to safeguard their agricultural infrastructure. The food crisis is one of the main threats hanging over peace and stability in the world. In 2050, small farmers will have to feed more than 9 billion people. Soil damage, damage to biodiversity, oil dependency, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and the development of consumption patterns put us in a very fragile situation, more fragile than 40 years ago. Poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity. The need to support local production is obvious. At the end of the 1950s, Europe introduced the common agricultural policy in order to produce the food it needed. To do this it protected its internal market and supported its consumers. This autonomous choice, this right to food sovereignty, must now be accessible to all the countries or groups of countries throughout the world that want it. José Bové  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, please excuse me, I was supposed to come earlier, but I was tied up. I was explaining to French listeners what took place yesterday in Luxembourg. I believe that the Council’s decision is a bad one, since the only word to appear in the text is ‘restructuring’. In France, we have gone from having 480 000 milk producers in 1984 to having fewer than 88 000 today. Today, we are told that yet more producers must be forced out and that the money that will be recouped – this appears in the text – will be used for producers who have exceeded their quota. Production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out. This is the wrong approach. The money that has been given, the EUR 280 million – the figure has already been quoted – equates to EUR 50 per month and per farm, for one year. That is peanuts; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through. Lastly, on the subject of Article 186, I should like to say that, at a time when we are moving towards codecision in agricultural matters, it is unacceptable for power, for a blank cheque, to be handed back to the Commission. José Bové,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for months now livestock farmers have been warning the Commission and the Council of the gravity of the crisis. Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas. The European Union had counted on growth in world demand. Its experts got it very wrong. The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption. The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council’s wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers. Times have changed. European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment. The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs. On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents. At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money. Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives. In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly. We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers. The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry. It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs. The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme. It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets. It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate. Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand. A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable. It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns. Without the small farmers, there will be no Europe. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, we are all saying the same thing: the employment situation in Europe is catastrophic. With one quarter of young people under 25 unemployed, there is a lot at stake for the new generation, which refuses to be a lost generation. The Commission has opened up the way with its employment package, which is designed to create 17 million jobs by 2020. However, it continues to lead us towards disaster by driving through austerity plans which increase unemployment and condemn the most vulnerable to the worst kind of hardships. Yet, an exit from the crisis is simple. We must transform our economy ecologically and socially. To that end, we need to develop green, sustainable and non-outsourceable jobs through targeted investments in green, innovative industries. We need to invest in life-long training and in promoting the social and solidarity economy. In addition, it is necessary to promote decent work, taking into account the objectives of the International Labour Organisation of improving rights and working conditions, and to reaffirm the vital need to increase the minimum wage so as to put an end to the scandal of poor workers and to fight social dumping. We have the means to end the scourge of unemployment. Yes, it is possible! What, then, is lacking? All that is lacking is the political will. That is your responsibility! Mr Barroso accorded high priority to the issue of youth and youth unemployment in particular. What is the youth unemployment situation now, three years later? There are no specific proposals. There is nothing. Action needs to be taken and it needs to be taken now. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, in its proposal for a regulation covering all the Structural Funds, the Commission has earmarked a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a future food aid scheme for the most needy for 2014-2020, despite fierce opposition from a minority of Member States within the Council. This is a brave decision by the Commission and one which is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, but, more importantly, with those of most of our fellow citizens. This is at a time when, with the worsening of the social crisis, increasing numbers throughout Europe are calling upon help from food banks. It is a brave decision, but it is not enough. At present, the food aid programme for the most deprived is worth EUR 500 million per year. By proposing a budget of EUR 2.5 billion over seven years, the Commission has consciously reduced this budget by EUR 1 billion, even though the demand is continuously increasing. In addition, we know nothing of the Commission’s intentions in terms of how the future programme will be introduced. If the funds are allocated within the framework of the European Social Fund, it will be difficult to continue buying food on the agricultural markets to distribute it to the most deprived because of the way in which the social fund is managed, especially since this practice has been condemned by the European Court of Justice. However, if no solution is found, the food banks will find themselves in a situation that they have managed to avoid until now. What do you actually intend to do? I, for one, believe it is necessary to maintain a decent budget for this programme and to ensure that each and every one of us, especially the most deprived, has the right to healthy food at an affordable price. Lastly, I believe an effective safety net is needed, as is a strong framework directive on a minimum income. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
).

 Commissioner, more than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. It is therefore with a certain amount of relief that we welcome the new extension of the European food aid programme until 2014. The poorest will continue to receive the essential charitable support that they need at a time when the demands faced by these charities are growing. Yet the real question is what next. What will happen after 2014? Is it not just lip service the promise to reduce poverty by a quarter in the EU by 2020? We must give ourselves the means to achieve this goal. That is why we will ensure that the new financial framework preserves this programme as part of the cohesion policy to ensure that those Member States in need do actually benefit from this aid. However, there is one condition: this transfer to the ESF should also be allocated a large enough budget to ensure that no-one is left by the wayside. What is at stake here is the matter of solidarity between the European people. One final point, Commissioner, the poorest are also entitled to a healthy and balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. Karima Delli,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, I am angry. Here we are two years after the consensus conference rightly piloted a European strategy for the homeless under the Belgian Presidency. The European Parliament drafted a written declaration in favour of the homeless. No response. I drafted the resolution in favour of a European strategy for the homeless. The Commission did not respond to our request, which remains a dead letter. I am sorry that today there is no one on the Council’s bench, while it is the Member States’ responsibility to ensure the right to housing assistance for all those who do not have sufficient resources. In two weeks, the spell of very cold weather has killed over 600 people; this has already been said. I say it time and again: the homeless do not only die in winter. All year round they sleep on the streets and all year round they have their rights trampled on. European citizens expect more from the European Union today. It must be united and active faced with the distress of the most vulnerable people. The situation is more than worrying. I will give you a few examples. In Greece, the number of homeless people has increased by 25% in two years. In Hungary, the homeless are persecuted by the police and threatened with heavy fines. In France, we are seeing decrees which criminalise begging and stealing food from bins. Where is this headed? We are seeing it more and more: austerity policies led by the governments will have disastrous consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, let us demand a shake-up, a wake-up call. We can change things. I will say it very clearly, Commissioner; the European Union must play its part for solidarity between the Member States and the European people. We must urgently bring together the ministers concerned. The time for saving the banks is over. It is now time to save lives. We have already waited too long. Each Member State must make the Commission aware of the measures it has put in place since the cold spell began. We must mobilise an emergency fund immediately to come to the aid of the most vulnerable people. The Member States which do not respect their obligation to provide emergency assistance to the most impoverished must be sanctioned, particularly those which criminalise the homeless or prohibit access to emergency shelters for certain groups of people. Finally, Mr Barnier, the Commission must put in place a European strategy for the homeless immediately. The aim is clear; we have discussed it here; ladies and gentlemen, no one should be sleeping on the streets by 2015. This is an emergency. In order to dream, you must have somewhere to sleep. If we let it, this glacial silence from European representatives will lead to distrust among the citizens. You really need to react … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) needs this debate. This instrument has a positive role but, first of all, the procedures are too long to provide effective protection for workers who need support quickly so that they are not left to their own devices. Secondly, the brief history of this EGF has already been plagued by very controversial cases of payments from public authorities which served only to repair the damage caused by companies savagely outsourcing. The European Union would do better than to beat its head against a brick wall. It needs, first of all, to think about how it authorises free trade which is both lawless and unscrupulous. When will social and environmental criteria be integrated in our commercial agreements to combat dumping? The famous EGF must be a tool supporting the immediate transition to high quality ‘green’ jobs, hence local jobs that cannot be outsourced. In the specific case of Renault, the EGF does not authorise the cofinancing of passive measures. What is the current situation in the case of Renault? Neither the Renault Group, nor the French Government, nor the European Commission has been able to convince us that the training measures offered to workers at the time were active measures. What does that mean? It means real training programmes aimed at making people employable. That is the first thing. Secondly, I think that the case, in particular, of all the workers threatened with insecurity because they joined the early retirement scheme is not a specifically French issue – as has been said – but a question of European solidarity. All workers must be treated in the same way: some have nothing to gain from measures, while others do. I am pleased to hear my colleague, Mr Gauzès, for whom I have very high regard, tell us today, in this Chamber, that Renault has committed itself to take concrete measures. I am a little sad to hear this only today. I think he should have woken up long ago. Karima Delli,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis should in no way be used as a pretext for neglecting health and safety at work. Our aim is to provide good-quality employment to all workers, despite persistent mass unemployment and a sharp rise in casual work. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at work, 168 000 people die each year in Europe as a result of work-related accidents and illnesses, of which more than half are cancers, and one quarter are cardio-vascular diseases. How can we not be shocked by this growing number? As rapporteur for the review of the European strategy on health and safety at work, which will come to an end in 2012, my conclusions are clear. It would be morally wrong to turn a blind eye to people’s suffering at work. It would also be a mistake in economic terms, because all the studies indicate that accidents and professional illnesses are very costly, both to our health and social security systems and to our businesses. From 2013 onwards, this strategy should be more ambitious, more consistent and, above all, more courageous. To achieve that, we need to strengthen the legislative framework and adapt current legislation to new occupational hazards such as psychosocial risks, musculoskeletal problems and nanomaterials. Work-related stress should not be treated merely with training courses, as this has proven entirely insufficient given that half of all European workers are exposed to risks that affect their mental health. The truth should be spelled out. Workers suffer, in particular, from the sudden reorganisation or intensification of their work and poor methods of management. Furthermore, many employees draw attention to dangers for people as well as the environment. These workers must be protected. I am proud that Parliament is calling on the Commission to establish a directive that protects these much talked about whistle-blowers. The European Commission should not hesitate to bring infringement proceedings against Member States that do not respect their obligations. European harmonisation in the health sphere is a significant step forward. It is also vital to foster a culture of prevention in Europe. The Member States should increase the staff employed in their labour inspection services and seek to achieve the objective of one inspector per 10 000 workers, in accordance with International Labour Organisation recommendations. There is absolutely no justification for weakening the prevention rules in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or for independent workers, who enjoy the same fundamental right to health protection. Furthermore, we have observed an increase in outsourcing of work and the emergence of subcontracting chains. There are new groups of workers who are not covered by prevention policies: casual workers, bogus self-employed people, subcontracted workers, and so on. Given the risk of exposure to powerful radiation and the dangers linked to the management of radioactive waste, it is essential that rigorous standards are applied to training, safety at work and inspection by independent bodies. Finally, we need to take stock of new, emerging hazards, such as chemical and biological risks, which are complex but for which there is still insufficient data. Rapid action needs to be taken on asbestos, silica and other recognised carcinogens. The REACH provisions play a very important part in preventing cancers and other work-related diseases. It needs to be kept up-to-date and comprehensively implemented. Finally, professional illnesses should be recognised, or better recognised, starting with cancers, in order to quickly identify all of the issues. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on all of you to support my report, because I am perfectly sure that it will enable us to meet all these challenges, and that Europe has a role to play. It should protect all workers, who must not lose their lives on account of their job. Commissioner, I hope that, from 2013, there will be a European strategy on health and safety at work, and I truly hope that we will make swift progress on this. Karima Delli,

Madam President, Mr Daerden, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank Mr Daerden for the true spirit of cooperation that has marked the work of the committee. First, a small preliminary point. I would like to remind this House that if we want to combat poverty, there is no use trying the employability approach. In other words, nowadays, work is no longer a true protection against poverty. There are millions of poor people in work. I would like to highlight three particular points which I think are vital if we want to make progress with realistic objectives in the fight against poverty within the EU 2020 strategy. Firstly, the call for a legislative proposal on schemes for a minimum income equal to 60% of the average income in each Member State, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our Parliament one year ago. I think that, as the crisis has worsened, we have become aware that such a measure is essential for our poorest citizens. Secondly, the call for a framework directive targeted at guaranteeing the quality of, and especially accessibility to, all social services of general interest, particularly in health, education, public transport, energy and water. Thirdly, we are re-drafting a call to Member States to adopt at the earliest opportunity the proposal for a wide-ranging, anti-discrimination proposal. I welcome these latter two points which seem to me of utmost importance. We are calling for the implementation of a genuine European strategy to help the homeless. The Commission and the Member States can no longer turn a deaf ear to the issue of poor housing in Europe. A genuine solution must be found to these problems today. I am also delighted that we have reached a final agreement on negotiations over food aid, but we should not forget that we must now start thinking about the period after 2013, or more generally about earmarking substantial sums from the cohesion policy budget for the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Finally, I would like to encourage the participation, thanks to this report, of all civil society in the introduction of the platform, because we can only speak for the poor if we do so with them. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
),

 The adoption of this report calling on the Commission to work towards introducing binding legislation on an adequate minimum income at the poverty threshold level, which is an indispensable tool for achieving the realistic objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020, is a major victory. To fight poverty, it is not enough to make speeches on growth: with 8.4% of workers poor in the EU, employment no longer protects against poverty. I am pleased that the proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to tax high incomes has been approved. It is high time that the Heads of State or Government understood that they are not there to serve the interests of the richest 1%, but to defend the 99%. I am pleased that people living in poverty will play a crucial role in the establishment of this platform. Today, policy must be drawn up ‘with’ and not just ‘for’ the poorest. I regret that our call for a framework directive on the quality and accessibility of social services of general interest was rejected. Universal access to public services is fundamental to the protection of the poorest. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 There are currently 80 million people living with a disability in Europe. Almost 70% of them are unemployed and 25% live in poverty. The European Union has a few aces up its sleeve to help these people and ensure greater equality of rights: raising more European funding, conducting widespread awareness campaigns, and compiling pan-European statistics in order to make public policies more effective. Above all, however, it is time to release the draft anti-discrimination directive, which has been blocked for over 10 years by Europe’s Heads of State or Government. I am pleased that my fellow MEPs have rallied behind us to ensure that the following message is heard loud and clear: the next stage in the fight for equal rights is an agreement between the EU Member States on this directive. Backed into a corner, the governments can no longer evade their responsibilities. We also call on the Commission to propose a major EU directive on accessibility for people with disabilities.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the wave of redundancies that is affecting workers across Europe must lead us to reflect on the role that we, as political representatives, must play in the face of multinational firms that are acting without any social ethics, proceeding with shareholder-driven redundancies and relocating their operations in order to cut costs, increase their shareholders’ profits and please the rating agencies, with no regard whatsoever for social and environmental standards. In its resolution of 29 September on the future of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), Parliament clearly expressed its desire to support, first and foremost, the workers adversely affected by restructuring. We called on the Commission to ensure consistency between EGF interventions and the European Union’s industrial policy, notably through the use of the structural funds. We also called for improvements in the future EGF Regulation to ensure that the fund does not generate moral hazard effects for multinational companies, as demonstrated today by the ArcelorMittal and Nokia cases. Commissioner, we can no longer continue to look separately at the structural funds and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund without taking into account the restructuring strategies of companies that benefit from them and without examining the cost-benefit ratio of a policy – and I shall say it again clearly – that benefits European workers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sawicki, the number of poor and unemployed people in the European Union continues to rise. More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme. The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival. The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid. I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested. Parliament spoke some strong words last time, when we said that human beings are more important than finance. It is high time we reasserted that. In any case, Parliament will be extremely vigilant, and we will not hesitate to renew our call in a constructive manner. Karima Delli,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, a debate is being held in this House on the situation of homeless people! I should like to begin by paying tribute to all the associations in the community that work all year round to help the most vulnerable people among us, the homeless. Not having a home to call one’s own is a serious violation of fundamental rights and human dignity. It is the most visible and the saddest link in the chain of poor housing. Above all, it is an unacceptable form of injustice. It is crucial to understand why people end up on the streets, so that proper preventive policies can be put in place. Rather than looking for ways of getting these people off the streets, it is much easier not to plunge them into homelessness in the first place. When are we going to put a stop to tenant eviction? When are we going to stop property speculation? When will we finally realise that rising poverty and insecurity lead to exclusion? The face of homelessness has changed; the image of the bohemian down-and-out belongs in the past. The reality today is much more complex and much harsher. It is increasingly young people, women, families – in particular migrants – and even poor workers who are without a home. There are many types of homelessness. Of course, there are the homeless people that one sees on the floor in the street, in winter, under cardboard boxes, or in tents in public parks, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Millions of people live in emergency hostels, in temporary housing or with friends or family; they may even sleep in cars or in insalubrious hotels. Faced with an emergency situation that is becoming worse by the day, the associations are constantly sounding the alarm. However, governments come and go, and the scandalous failure to address the situation continues. It is high time the Member States faced up to their responsibilities. It is high time we put a stop to this shameful situation. Europe must strive to help the Member States establish fundamental values and long-term solutions to this situation, because our main duty is to protect the weakest among us. In the light of this unacceptable situation, we cannot continue to look the other way, in the same way as people avoid looking at homeless people on the street. What is worse, homeless people are expelled from town centres to the outskirts, far from the stares of businessmen and tourists. However, just because they are out of sight, it does not mean they do not exist! There is no point in hiding the problem; it needs to be resolved today. In one country, which you know well, Commissioner, homeless people are quite simply regarded as criminals. They are forbidden from sleeping on the streets, and are fined if they do, and the police hunt them down as far as underground stations or railway stations, despite the fact that there are no appropriate services in place to accommodate them. The time for communication, false political promises and campaign slogans, as we see in certain States, is now past. That is why, following the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, Parliament is calling on you to implement an integrated strategy aimed at resolving the problem of homelessness by 2020, based on the work that has already been carried out. This strategy should focus on five major objectives: firstly, preventing homelessness; secondly, reducing its duration; thirdly, targeting the most severe types of homelessness; fourthly, improving the quality of services for homeless people; and finally, providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing. This strategy must be coordinated with national and regional strategies. The results achieved with regard to the indicators developed jointly at European level must be regularly reviewed. Emphasis must be placed on social innovation, in particular, measures aimed at making housing the first step on the path towards social reintegration. Lastly, adequate funding must be guaranteed at both European and national level. Commissioner, all talk aside, this is an emergency. Action is needed now. This is a question of political will: people do not have to be made homeless. Let us not wait until winter to remember that people die on the streets all year round. It is possible to put a stop to homelessness, and I think that the European Parliament is showing the way. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

It is high time that you faced up to your responsibilities. In particular, you need to prod into action all those Member States that are failing to help our poorest citizens. It is also high time that we eradicated poverty. How long are we going to wait before adopting a real framework directive on minimum pay that will allow everyone to live in dignity, but above all, will give them enough to eat and guarantee all of their fundamental rights? At a time when we are discussing a European platform against poverty and when we are being told that 43 million Europeans are at risk, you decide to cut the budget. That is a scandalous decision.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty is the most cruel, most inhumane and most degrading penalty, and is a violation of the right to life, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Davinder Pal Singh is in danger of being executed imminently in New Delhi, in India, as the President of India rejected his plea for clemency in May, and it should be noted that this is the second appeal rejected in the course of that month. That is why this resolution sends a strong signal from the European Parliament. The European Parliament must condemn all executions, no matter where they take place. The European Parliament must encourage the European Union and its Member States to ensure that the United Nations resolution calling for a universal moratorium on executions is applied. The aim of this resolution is to achieve complete abolition in all those states that still apply capital punishment. I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed to this resolution. I shall simply mention in closing that I have tabled two amendments, because I would like to remind you that Davinder Pal Singh had already applied for political asylum in Germany, but he was forcibly deported to India, where he was arrested on his arrival in New Delhi in January 1995. Nevertheless, two years later, the Court in Frankfurt declared his expulsion to be illegal. He should therefore never have been deported to India, where his life was under threat. Finally, there is a wide range of evidence to suggest that Davinder Pal Singh did not receive a fair trial. That is the subject of the second amendment to be voted on. I would like to thank my fellow Members, and I hope that the entire resolution and the two amendments will be adopted. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I welcome the vote on the report by Mr De Rossa, which reminds us that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are at the heart of the European social model. We would point out that SSGIs are available to everyone and that we should ensure that everyone has access to them, especially with regard to social housing. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to propose legislation recognising universal access to basic banking services and to broadband Internet. Finally, we are asking for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between economic and non-economic services, which would provide greater protection for social services. Unfortunately, while the urgency of the economic and social situation would have required Members to demand a framework legislative tool on SSGIs, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed in its alternative resolution, my fellow Members refused to take that courageous initiative. The horizontal social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantee social rights, especially the right to access services of general interest. The time has come to prove to EU citizens that a social Europe is on its way and to give public services the place they deserve in European law. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, the cross-cutting social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon place a binding obligation on States to protect social rights and the right of access to services of general interest in particular. It is time we proved to Europe’s citizens that social Europe works. We must therefore give our body of social legislation its rightful place in EU law, by acknowledging the specific nature of social services of general interest where competition rules are concerned, bearing in mind that these services are strongly linked to local communities and rely on parties involved in the social economy. Mr De Rossa’s report is an opportunity to affirm principles that are simple and at the same strongly rooted in common sense, equality and universal access to these collectively run services, which contribute to social well-being and progress. Commissioner, you said: ‘The time has come to put ideas into practice.’ The time has come indeed, which is why I propose that in this debate you should provide real support for a European legislative instrument for public social services. I therefore call upon you to vote for the alternative motion for a resolution tabled by our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, cohesion policy must ensure harmonious and above all fair development between all territories. It is for this reason that we support the introduction of a new category of intermediary regions for the allocation of funds, as well as the application of new development indicators and indicators for social justice, well-being and environmental justice. We regret that this does not appear in the Pieper report. For the sake of fairness, cohesion policy must also tackle sub-regional development inequalities to restore meaning to the word ‘cohesion’, that is to say this solidarity which is the added value of the European Union. To achieve this, it must focus on inequalities, especially within urban areas, which are particularly affected by new challenges – social, environmental – and that is a huge task. Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there. It will also promote a new sustainable city, desirable for all, a model that meets the environmental, energetic and socio-demographic challenges, but one which places the living environment and the well-being of its inhabitants at the heart of our concerns. I will end with a clear message: after 2013, cohesion policy must have at its disposal much-needed and stable resources to be able to exist. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 I am delighted that this report has been adopted, since most of our ideas (climate, social cohesion, integrated and bottom-up approach, disadvantaged neighbourhoods, cross-funding and so on) are included. However, I do regret that with regard to implementing the urban dimension, there is not a clearer signal in favour of a more widespread use of general subsidies for direct management by towns. Furthermore, this report should have elaborated on opening up deprived neighbourhoods, the role of medium-sized towns in the urban agenda, as well as the battle for climate and social mixing in our towns.

I welcome the ideas that have been taken forward, through the adoption of this report, to enhance synergies between policies with an impact on territories, on the one hand, and between funds, on the other hand, in particular by increasing financing and setting up multiregional programmes. I find it deplorable, however, that the involvement of local and regional powers in the decision-making process is not being viewed as a priority. Improving governance through the additional involvement of authorities with decentralised management capacities is the way to respond to the need for absorption, efficiency and simplification, all of which are desirable when implementing cohesion policy.

 By adopting this report, I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved, since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as ‘intermediate’ for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions. Karima Delli,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Mr President, first of all, I shall deal with the cultural and creative industries. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent. In this report, particular attention is paid to the working conditions in the sector, in particular, irregular income and insecure working relations, which call for an in-depth debate in order to take account of specific aspects, for instance, by fighting against discrimination in terms of remuneration, and to improve the match between job held and level of qualification. We want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content, and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards. Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes. I now turn to the ‘Youth on the Move’ scheme. Things are tough for young Europeans: whether accessing employment, education, accommodation, social services, they undergo what is tantamount to the ordeals of a social initiation ceremony. We need to restore their confidence in the future by providing adapted and ambitious answers. I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training. In this respect, I should like to stress the request, which I support, put to the European Commission, for a Green Paper on youth participation. Our report also highlights the idea of mobility, which should be accessible to all, and I welcome that. Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training. It would be regrettable to categorise young Europeans as either an educated elite, multilingual and confident in the future, or as young people left behind on the grounds that they do not have a Masters degree or because they are only doing manual work. I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme. I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people’s autonomy. Our report insists on the main desire of young people to be autonomous, to have access to healthcare in particular, and to have decent accommodation at a reasonable price. We all know that the young person who has no option but to work as well as study is heading towards failure in his/her studies. Finally, I am delighted that, in this House, it has been recognised that work placements should no longer be jobs in disguise, fully-fledged jobs. Work placements must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection. (Applause) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE
),

 In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work. These women contribute to our economy, yet they suffer very poor working conditions and violations of their most basic rights. The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a ‘Convention on decent work for domestic workers’. This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards. The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as they have to commit to ratify this convention. At European level, we will also need to stop considering separately and systematically the immigration and labour policies. It is not right for domestic workers to be coerced into informal work, regardless of their rights, because of an immigration regulation that is too strict and ill-adapted. Karima Delli,

 Mr President, the United Nations report, published on 11 April, throws light on the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed in Sri Lanka in the conflict between the government forces of Mr Rajapaksa and the Tamil Tiger independence movement. The clashes in May and June 2009 gave rise to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and thousands of civilians lost their lives. We cannot accept the impunity of those responsible and of the authors of these crimes. The government of Mr Rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the UN report and it even contests its conclusions. In Sri Lanka, the press is muzzled, and journalists are subject to intimidation and arbitrary detention. The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations. The Tamil minority is the victim of a genocide that dare not speak its name. We must urgently send European Parliament observers to the north of Sri Lanka to see what is really happening there and reassert the principle of the self-determination of peoples. (The speaker agreed to take two blue card questions under Rule 149(8)) Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Mr Tannock, I used that word by way of a metaphor, above all, to label the phenomenon. However, I have made it clear that it was not the name. The facts have to be established. In any case, what is happening to the Tamil minority cannot be shrugged off as a simply anodyne act. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 The European Parliament adopted a report, this Tuesday 5 April 2011, on fighting violence against women. This text emphasises the specific nature of violence against women and girls by men: it is indeed one of the most common and harmful obstacles to gender equality. Today’s report will make it possible to implement a criminal-law instrument in the form of a European Union directive to combat gender-based violence. Indeed, it establishes a European charter, which will ensure a minimum level of assistance, including the right to free legal aid and urgent psychological aid services. Furthermore, MEPs are calling on the Commission to establish a European observatory on violence against women. Thanks to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, an adopted amendment also calls for Member States to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship, as a crime.

 The European Parliament has voted in favour of the principle of creating a single work and residence permit for third-country nationals in a Member State. This procedure provides a set of common rights for these workers, particularly with regard to working conditions, such as working time and holidays. The text also sets out the principle of reimbursing pension contributions already made by workers who leave the EU, since they will be unable to receive their pensions after they retire. This text is problematic, however, since it reinforces the ‘country of origin’ principle for some categories of workers, a principle that was fought by the European left during the time of the famous ‘Bolkestein’ Directive. This principle creates a kind of two-speed labour market depending on the worker’s origin, and contributes to a form of social dumping. There is a contradiction here: do we really want to protect the European social model, and should it exclude non-European workers, or should it take a universalist approach and stop discriminating against workers by giving them different rights? This text does not yet resolve this fundamental issue, which is why I decided to abstain from voting on the text. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Parliament has adopted a good text. It emphasises Europe’s important role in ensuring the social inclusion of the Roma within the European Union, with the application of this strategy at local level. The report points out that a strategy for the Roma is possible only with the cooperation of members of the community – in short, we must work ‘with’ before we work ‘for’. The Roma should therefore be involved in any decision making. The text points out the difficult living conditions, discrimination and difficulties in accessing essential services that the Roma suffer. It points out the need to ensure respect for the freedom of movement of European citizens. It also mentions the importance, in social inclusion terms, of social protection, vocational training, education and public service provision. It denounces the insufficient allocation of funds, when the money could be put to good use. However, the real drawback of this report is the insistence by the conservatives in the European Parliament on mentioning the need to combat the Roma people’s so-called ‘prolonged dependence’ on the social welfare system. This is a scandalous prejudice aimed once again at marginalising the Roma community. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 This text does not stand out for its quality, since it is the result of a very broad compromise between the MEPs. It contains both elements that are very positive in the eyes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and certain ideas that we have sought in vain to denounce. However, the main thing is that it enables MEPs to express a rather progressive opinion on the EU 2020 strategy’s flagship programme dedicated to industry. Hence, the text calls for transport systems to be made more sustainable through the use of more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions. It points out the need to place energy and resource savings at the heart of European industrial policy. In this respect, it recalls the huge job potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield. The adoption of measures that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors. MEPs also sought to encourage all the efforts made to redress skills shortages in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry.

 I welcome the vote on this report on equality between men and women. In terms of remuneration, for example, and despite continued legislative efforts on the subject at European level, women still earn 18% less on average than men for the same work in the European Union. I would also like to emphasise that we had to battle for a long time within this Parliament merely to ensure that such a basic right as access to contraception could be mentioned. This kind of rearguard debate does little for the reputation of the European right. Luckily, the final report is a good one. It sets the objective of reducing the pay gap to less than 5% by 2020 and, in particular, calls on the Member States to do all they can to enforce the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’, with sanctions for non-compliant States. It calls for binding objectives to ensure equality in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some emotion and on behalf of my fellow Members, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Lynne, Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Protasiewicz, that I would like to express my sincere thanks for your support of Written Declaration 61/2010 on an EU homelessness strategy. While today, the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative – a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion – this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States. The time for talking is over. It is now time to act. Specific proposals can now be implemented. Let us make sure that we have put an end to rough sleeping by 2015. I wish you all a happy holiday and I believe we will get off to a good start next year. (Applause) Karima Delli,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 million people living in poverty in Europe, over 5 million homeless, millions poorly housed, one in five children victims of poverty, and, at the other end of the scale, what do we have? The number of billionaires is increasing. We have just held the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October and the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will soon draw to a close, but what will we have to show for this? What concrete solutions will Europe have offered to those who are the primary victims of a crisis for which they are not responsible? What hope can we offer my generation, this European generation bearing the brunt of unemployment, insecurity and exclusion, these young people who are mistrustful of Europe, who expect a lot from Europe and therefore from you? We are duty bound to answer their day-to-day concerns and their anxieties over the future. The Lisbon strategy has failed in its mission to eradicate poverty. We can no longer stand by idly and let things happen. Now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetoric. The time has come to be bold and show some political courage. All the organisations working with victims of poverty, ATD Fourth World, the European Anti-poverty Network (EAPN), the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), Emmaüs Europe, have been demanding this for 20 years! That is why we are asking the European Commission for a framework directive which aims to set an adequate minimum income. This framework directive will ensure eligibility for and access to an adequate minimum income so that any child, adult or elderly person living in poverty can break free from it, thus guaranteeing them their inalienable right to live in dignity. Time is running out, ladies and gentlemen, the need for action has never been more urgent. Together, we can put an end to the outrageous scandal that is long-term poverty. Poverty, end poverty, this should not be just a slogan. It is a reality and together, I hope, we will take on this battle. Karima Delli  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Courard, Commissioner, the principal objective of the European Union, an objective which appears in the Treaty of Lisbon, is the development of a social market economy oriented towards full employment and social progress. It therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment, adequate social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all EU policies. The recognition of social rights and, in particular, of the right to access services of general interest, is made binding in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter contains rights and principles, such as the right to access social security payments, housing benefits and social services. On the eve of the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, initiated by Parliament, how can you claim that, in applying the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, only the rules on competition and the internal market need apply to these social services of general interest, with no adaptation to their specific modes of organisation and financing? Is it not true that the Services Directive, for example, calls into question the role of social services of general interest with a strong local base consisting of community members who are not aiming for financial gain? When will you stop burying your head in the sand and when will you finally shoulder your responsibility as colegislator, in accordance with the provisions of the new Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the positive progress that this directive represents in the face of the urgent need to combat climate change. 2010 is the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The European Partnership for Energy and the Environment (EPEE) estimates that between 50 and 125 million Europeans suffer from energy poverty. However, this new legislation concerns only new buildings and will affect only 2.7 million new homes per year, when there are 200 million old homes in the European Union. The fact is, at least 150 million homes will have to be renovated by 2050 in order to attain factor 4. Commissioner, since 2007, 4% of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has been set aside to improve the energy performance of buildings, but has been used only to a very limited extent. How, then, are you going to put pressure on the Member States to really use these funds, because if they go unused, they are liable to disappear from 2013, when some of them will actually have to be increased? Karima Delli,

Mr President, 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and it is in this context that we shall adopt, I hope, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij, which represents a major advance in the improvement of the living conditions of disadvantaged populations, insofar as it makes eligible for European aid, via the ERDF, projects for renovating and building housing and for combating energy poverty in all the Member States. This proposal, which is supported by the Council of Europe, has long been awaited by all those who campaign for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities, and particularly of the Roma. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the fact that the Union is investing heavily in the improvement of housing for the most disadvantaged communities, but we must not stop now that we are doing so well. We will be very vigilant with regard to the actual use of these funds, since they must not result in the exclusion of marginalised communities. Indeed, there are numerous examples of urban renovation projects. They include the restoration of the city centre of Barcelona, and the work to regenerate the historic centres in the new Member States, which have done particularly well out of real estate speculation through the explosion in rent and rental charges. This, in turn, has led to the most disadvantaged families being driven away from the city centres. These people absolutely must receive genuine social support and access to all public services, such as education, health care and public transport, but – as we proposed during the examination in committee – they must also receive resources sufficient to enable them to remain in these neighbourhoods, so that the latter do not become gentrified. Parliament will have to evaluate the projects carried out before these funds are renewed in 2013 and will have to be involved in drafting the future regulation laying down the eligibility criteria, particularly in relation to transparency, so as to ensure that every single vulnerable population actually receives these funds and is afforded a dignified existence in the long term.

Madam President, President Václav Havel’s speech to our House highlighted one of the fundamental principles of the European Union: solidarity among human beings. We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that wall of shame. Following 9 November 1989, we were told that humanity would finally be set free. Democracy and human rights were supposed to extend to the entire planet, knocking down walls, removing barriers between peoples. However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent? The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive. Let us knock down the walls of fortress Europe, let us build bridges, not walls … (The President cut off the speaker) Karima Delli,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the Sri Lankan Government has maintained a wall of silence regarding the situation of the Tamil civilian population, preventing foreign media and humanitarian organisations from gaining access to them. Since March 2009, Colombo has been holding almost all of the civilians who fled the fighting between the army and the Tamil Tigers, in complete violation of international law and human rights. In July, the Sri Lankan Government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north-east of the island. The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases. In some camps, more than 1 000 people are dying every week, mainly of dysentery. The living conditions are appalling. President Rajapaksa declared last week that only 100 000 Tamil refugees would be released. In view of the scale of the tragedy, the European Union must step up the pressure on the Sri Lankan Government in order to obtain the immediate and unconditional release of all the civilians, access to the camps for journalists and the prompt delivery of humanitarian aid.

Mr President, my speech concerns the deterioration in working conditions in Europe. Today, nearly half of the people working in the world earn less than USD 2 a day. 12.3 million people are still victims of slavery, and more than 200 million children are forced to work. In Europe, the number of working poor is increasing day by day, and each year the International Labour Organisation records 160 000 deaths linked to a lack of prevention. In this context, I would like to emphasise our responsibility towards all those who are deprived of jobs and social rights, who work in unfit conditions, towards those millions of workers who suffer mentally and physically, who are, at times, driven to suicide, or who are victims of cancers or chronic diseases caused by their working conditions. It is time to break with the religion that dictates that we must work harder, and to stop the race to make profits and to compete in the short term. Guaranteeing the right to decent work and strengthening labour law must be the Union’s top priority over the next 10 years. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleagues have said, the image of the European Union that Erasmus gives is a good one. Endangering this standard-bearer for the European Union, which has done so much to create a positive image and which meets the needs of young people at a time when many of our fellow citizens are having doubts about the European project, is tragic. The Council representatives present have underlined the many problems there are in 2012 and also concerning the future funding of Erasmus, but have not given any firm answers. The question being put to the Member States today, on which there is a consensus in Parliament, is this: are you going to increase your contributions to its funding to meet the commitments you have made? Quite apart from Erasmus, the issue of funding for education programmes and also for the Cohesion Fund is equally tragic. Personally, I am a supporter of independent financing of the EU budget, which would liberate us from the Member States’ erratic decision-making. Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ever since President Mubarak’s fall in February 2011, Egypt has been run by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which gave itself the powers to legislate and to draft the Constitution. How can we not be worried? It was against this backdrop that Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, was elected on 24 June. For many Egyptian women, Mohamed Morsi's election jeopardises women’s rights. It should be pointed out that Islamist MPs had previously proposed reforming a provision that allows women to divorce without their husband’s consent. Similarly, they tried to pass a law banning women from seeking a divorce. Women must be listened to and their demands heard. Without them, democracy in Egypt will not be possible. They call for the provisions of the Charter on Women's Rights to be implemented in Egypt, a charter established last year by more than a thousand women and approved by half a million Egyptian citizens, men and women alike. This document sanctions fundamental rights such as the right to participate in political and economic life, representation in government and equality before the law. The Egyptian legal system must protect women against all forms of violence. We absolutely must support these demands, demands which are legitimate. Will Baroness Ashton support them? What steps will she consider to support Egypt on the road to democracy? How can we, as Europeans, respond to the concerns of these young people and women who fear that the arrival of the Islamists … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to add a few words to what Mr Alfonsi has said, and to applaud his work. Macro-regional strategies offer very interesting prospects for decentralised collaborative projects in the Mediterranean region. I think they provide an appropriate framework for the problems of this region, where, in the light of last year’s events, we must develop active neighbourhood policies, aimed at young people in particular. I would like to stress three particular points from my opinion. The first is cooperation in the field of youth, by promoting the European programmes designed for them, and through synergies with the work of the Mediterranean Office for Youth, which needs to be more publicised. The second is the creation of networks between Euro-Mediterranean universities and the removal of obstacles to the movement of students, lecturers and researchers, by simplifying visa procedures for these groups in particular. This is essential and urgent. The third is the quality of teaching and research in these networks, to be achieved by supporting and adequately funding the Tempus and Erasmus Mundus programmes and, I must stress, by automatically granting visas to these groups when they join the European programmes. Thank you to Mr Alfonsi for his productive collaboration, and thank you to all the Members who contributed to this report. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of Volunteering 2011 served to put volunteering under the spotlight and to give the voluntary sector an opportunity to put forward valuable recommendations. I congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission for their contributions on this issue. Mr Scurria’s report highlights the importance of ensuring that all citizens have access to volunteering activities and have the right to make their own contribution in order to support altruism and solidarity in their local area. Volunteering and community work as a whole represent an antidote to the changes in the labour market and to the risk of excluding parts of the population from enjoying basic goods and services. For our group, volunteering must not be a new way of getting people into insecure employment. It is about clearly differentiating between the value of volunteering, provided free of charge, and profit-making activities. Furthermore, we encourage Member States to recognise the rights of volunteers and to use the European Charter on the Rights and Responsibilities of Volunteers as a point of reference.

This report supports the Commission’s policy of taking a liberal approach. Deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) entail the dismantling of tariff barriers and opening of markets and may weaken these emerging economies. Social, environmental, educational and cultural issues are not addressed sufficiently, contrary to the aspirations of the people. Furthermore, DCFTAs are the result of a long process with strict criteria, particularly the obligation to align with European internal market regulations. In addition, these numerous requirements are not related to the prospect of integration into the European Union, as may have been the case for the countries of Eastern Europe. Do we need reminding of the EU’s failure in relation to the Mediterranean? These agreements focus on bilateral relations, failing to provide support for the regional integration of these countries. Instead, such agreements pit these countries against each other for the honour of being ‘champions’ who meet their criteria. At a time when Europeans are considering the possibility of European protectionism, we are demanding the opposite from our Southern partners. Is that really consistent? Is it fair? I do not believe so and that is why I am voting against this report, despite the fact that it does have some positive aspects. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, we cannot remain indifferent to or silent about the tragic situation suffered by the Syrian people as they face Bashar al-Assad’s bloody regime. We cannot abandon the Syrian people. First, let us firmly state our support for, and solidarity with, the Syrian people who are suffering. What strategy shall we build? What can we do? First, condemn the veto exercised at the UN by the Chinese and Russian governments and demand that NGOs and journalists be allowed to operate on Syrian territory. Next, support the people by supplying the medicines and medical equipment that they are lacking, bearing in mind that even rural hospitals are being attacked. Medicine cannot be used as a weapon. It is also important to contribute to the setting up of a humanitarian corridor. Finally, we must recognise and support the Syrian opposition around the Syrian National Council so that they can rebuild a state that matches the aspirations of the Syrian people. Furthermore, we must send Assad and those responsible for crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to two points regarding two of our partners on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. The first point is the concern of many Algerians regarding current reforms and, in particular, the law on associations to be voted on in the Algerian Parliament. Algerian civil society is concerned that this law could stifle society as a result of two new things that it introduces. Firstly, all associations will have to apply for a licence in order to exist. Secondly, foreign funding, including European, will no longer be allowed. The second point is that in Tunisia, at a time when the rule of law is being established and a new constitution negotiated, independent judges want our support so that they have the means to work towards establishing an independent judiciary and the training of Tunisian judges in transitional justice. Commissioner, will you respond to these concerns and these demands? Malika Benarab-Attou

 Mr President, at a time when Tunisia has just held its first democratic elections, the Member States of the European Union are still struggling to support the aspirations of those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and to demonstrate real solidarity. The Council’s reactions to the revolutions in the countries on the southern shore can no longer be limited to declarations of principle and short-term objectives. The European Union must move up a gear by proposing concrete, long-term measures. This is the purpose of this resettlement programme. The conclusion – at last – of the ordinary legislative procedure on this issue and, by extension, the application by all the Member States of the common European programme on the resettlement of refugees, at a historic moment in time, would bear witness to our will to react effectively by working together to propose suitable instruments. Currently, only 10 Member States participate annually in the resettlement of refugees, and there is no proper coordination when they do. Yet the representatives of the EU Member States have said again in recent months that they support the peoples’ aspirations. This support for the people of partner countries must result in Europe showing solidarity by accommodating refugees. The European resettlement programme should be an additional tool for protecting refugees and asylum seekers. It should allow for the implementation of a European hospitality policy for resettled populations. It needs to be implemented urgently. We must break the deadlock before the end of 2011, and it is up to the Council to do this. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Bastos, for her work and fruitful working relationship with the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, of which I am one. We agree with the Commission’s observation as regards the need to raise the qualification levels of young Europeans as well as the need to redefine certain skills that students might need today. We must not limit our proposals to satisfying the needs of labour market areas; we must also guarantee fair and universal access to quality public education and lifelong learning, so as to promote the intellectual and social development of every citizen, and particularly of young people, given the unacceptably high rate of unemployment among that age group. In order to achieve this, I believe there are two crucial aspects: firstly, digital literacy, which is becoming increasingly important for our evolving knowledge-based society. Emphasis must be placed, first and foremost, on literacy-based initiatives, and on refreshing and updating key skills in the field of communication and information technology, so as to reduce, or indeed eliminate, the digital divide. The next step for the Member States, therefore, is to integrate digital culture into teaching and training systems, while teaching a critical approach to modern forms of communication and media content. Secondly, and more generally, education and training have a place in the Green New Deal that we environmentalists wish to implement in the European Union. Indeed, we need to start by speeding up the transition towards a sustainable economy and developing the huge potential for green jobs that exists throughout Europe, with a view to protecting and restoring environmental quality and the quality of life of our fellow citizens across a wide range of sectors, such as transport, energy supply and even public services … (The President cut off the speaker) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, how much longer are we going to ask Tunisians indirectly to bear the dramatic consequences of our poor management of aid to the refugees? The solidarity shown by Tunisian society is crumbling. We can no longer remain indifferent to the health situation and the new outbreaks of diseases in the camps. It has to be recognised that we, the European Union, have failed on several points: an inhumane migration policy; shameful humanitarian aid measures to tackle the huge needs on the ground; a lack of European solidarity, calling into question the very foundations of Europe. How do we, as European defenders of human rights, see ourselves? What support is the European Union talking about when it addresses people who have, today, effected their democratic revolution? We have the resources to help these refugees but, if there is no political will or tangible force, the Mediterranean will remain a cemetery. Is this acceptable? Can we continue in this way? We must reconsider the issue of the refugees and migration on the basis of a human rights approach taking into account the new political situations. The security approach and the ‘dusting’ carried out by the Frontex Agency are no match for our high standards and values. In the short, medium and long term, the financial assistance given by the European Union must be directed at strengthening the capacities of civil society in Tunisia, in particular, and in the countries of the south more generally. I should like to conclude by stressing that the immigrants of today are resources and not a burden. Am I not an example? Yesterday an immigrant, today a Member of the European Parliament.

 Madam President, the peoples of the southern Mediterranean expect a strong gesture of solidarity and support from us amid the upheaval and the challenges they face. These are peoples whom we colonised in the recent past, which means that we have an added responsibility. In supporting their democratic transition, we must devise, here in Europe, a true policy of hospitality that is consistent with our value of fraternity. Devising a policy of hospitality means, first of all, reviewing the reception conditions at our borders and ensuring that the fundamental rights of those who cross them are respected. It also means finding a solution for the thousands of young people who are dying in the Mediterranean, before our very eyes. This is unacceptable. This report, despite including new clauses on respect for human rights and fundamental rights in Frontex’s mandate, is not aimed at a new policy of hospitality. Despite the proposed changes, Frontex’s mandate is still confined to a repressive ‘fortress Europe’ attitude. We must continue our efforts to guarantee more thorough assessments of Frontex operations, with the help of an independent monitoring body, so as to ensure respect for democracy and fundamental rights set out in our report.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the demands for democracy, freedom and dignity of the peoples of the southern Mediterranean call for action from us here in Europe, their northern Mediterranean neighbours. We have taken too long to respond – or, in some cases, not to respond – to these long-standing needs, in keeping with the values that we preach. First Algeria, then Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Morocco, Jordan: the people of the southern Mediterranean are reminding us of a longing to be able to live according to the universal values of equality, freedom and brotherhood. The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) might be the project on which our new relationship could be based, around common values of solidarity and respect for the law. However, the UfM has come up against Israel’s policies, as it continues to flout international law and to colonise Palestinian territory. The UfM summit has been cancelled twice because of this. It is time we put our words into action and stopped applying double standards. Baroness Ashton, will you dare to take action that will allow the Palestinian state to exist within its 1967 borders and lift the blockade on Gaza? The time has come to do this if we do not want to lose credibility in the eyes of our southern neighbours. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the G8 countries decided to grant the sum of USD 40 billion to Tunisia and Egypt, as has already been said. However, the European Union must present the case for greater transparency, visibility and traceability; in short, better governance of this aid. We need to focus on four key points: first, ensuring that development cooperation is in keeping with the principles of democracy and absolute transparency; second, guaranteeing respect for human rights; strengthening the role and capacities of civil society organisations and reforming the system of governance that applies to aid, with stronger involvement by the European Parliament. Mr Barroso, the EU must be able to guarantee that this aid reaches the people it is intended for. What concrete measures is the EU planning in this respect? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports by Mrs Schaake and Mrs Sanchez-Schmid remind us that culture is not a decoration motif but the fruit of complex interdependencies, showing that cultural questions should be addressed in a transverse manner and integrated into all European policies, internal as well as external, social as well as economic. In this respect, I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees, with the European Commission’s other services, as well as with Baroness Ashton’s European External Action Service. Furthermore, I would like to come back to a point that has not been expanded on in these reports, concerning the mobility of artists and of professionals in the cultural sector. Indeed, this issue is of major importance for the emergence of a European cultural area. In this regard, two aspects seem to me to be important; namely, firstly, the dissemination by the European Union and Member States of clear and understandable information on regulations and procedures currently in force. Secondly, the removal – as has already been said – of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union. I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas. Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries. Therefore, Europe should reposition itself and not abandon the battle over soft power, since what is at stake here today is respect for cultural diversity as a tool for dialogue and as a guarantee of peace and stability worldwide.

 Madam President, Commissioner, in your description of the outlook for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the Southern Mediterranean, you referred to potential catalysts. However, you forgot to mention one group, to which I myself belong. In Europe, people like me –immigrants and the children of immigrants – who come from the area that was once colonised by Europe, are still stigmatised. Yet we are, and we could become, human resources: influential mediators between north and south at this historic time. Commissioner Füle, what are your thoughts on that option? Will you take it into consideration? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, this report is sensitive, and I must criticise its title. The use of the words ‘migration flows’ sets the tone: it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or invaders. These are historic times for the peoples of the Southern Mediterranean and us, but the fear of mass immigration is preventing the EU and the Member States from creating a new dynamic. The recent democratic movements in the South have helped make us aware of our contradictions. They have demonstrated once again the inconsistency and lack of vision of our obsolete and out-of-touch cooperation policies. It is high time the European Union implemented a migration policy that is consistent with our values, that recognises that we live in a world in which people are mobile, a world in which human beings move around. To continue to talk about migration flows is absurd and goes against our humanist values. If we Europeans want to be major players in the world, then we have to change our approach and work towards creating a solidarity-based Union for the Mediterranean; we cannot do so without revising mobility policy, or what is today referred to as migration policy. We must meet the expectations of the peoples of the South. The fear of immigration must no longer guide our policies. Strengthening border controls must no longer be our main motivation in implementing cooperation agreements, as it was in the case of Libya. We must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements, so that we respect human rights. Our actions are still characterised by a security-driven approach to mobility, which goes against our values and the requirement we have to protect populations. The scandalous position adopted by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Guéant must be vigorously denounced. Commissioner, what kind of policy must we adopt in order to establish a true Union for the Mediterranean, one in which we show solidarity with the peoples of the South, who today feel scorned by us? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, having mistakenly supported dictatorial regimes along the southern coast of the Mediterranean, supposedly as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism, we now need to rise to the challenge presented by these historic events. Europe needs to revise its current policy on authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. President Mubarak must step down now. It behoves us to support the democracies and democratic processes chosen by the people of these countries, not simply to impose our own vision. Let us listen to their voices, let us exercise humility, let us not confuse secularism and security. Change is already happening in these countries. Our financial instruments need to be adapted in order to provide reliable support for the champions of democracy … (The President cut off the speaker

Our fellow citizens must be better informed about country of origin marking and must be able to make purchases in full knowledge of the facts. Europeans still do not know, in fact, whether they are buying goods that have genuinely been produced in Israel or which have come from Israeli colonies in Palestinian territories. The standardisation of origin marking practices in the Union, particularly for agricultural products that come from Israel and the Palestinian territories, is directed to this end.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), two out of thirteen cross-border cooperation programmes are dedicated to the Mediterranean Basin. The first is the cooperation programme for the Mediterranean Basin. With the new generation of European funds for 2007-2013, the European Union has decided to resolutely develop cooperation actions between the north and south shores of the Mediterranean. To this end, the European Union has established the Mediterranean Sea Basin ENPI programme. What territories exactly does this programme apply to? What projects could be co-financed, given that we know that the cooperation programme finances 80% of the total cost of the cooperation programmes in which partner programmes representing at least three eligible countries in a very wide range of fields participate? The second part of the ENPI cross-border programme for Italy and Tunisia has a total allocation for 2007-2013 of EUR 25 191 million. The eligible regions are in Italy and Tunisia. The management authority is the region of Sicily, with Palermo. The objective of the cross-border cooperation programme for Italy and Tunisia is to encourage economic, institutional and cultural integration of the Tunisian and Sicilian regions through a process of joint sustainable development in the context of cross-border cooperation. The programme has three priorities. The first is regional development and regional integration. The second is to encourage sustainable development, through the management of agricultural and fisheries resources, to protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage and to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. My question is as follows: what measures have been put in place to monitor the trade in coral, a fisheries resource that is endangered and the subject of illegal trafficking? The third priority is cultural and scientific cooperation, and support for networks, by strengthening cooperation at association level, training and exchanges between young people and students. My question is as follows: how, beyond the objective of funding, do we ensure that this programme of human exchanges takes place given the obstacles associated with the implementation of the Return Directive by European countries and the management of Schengen visas?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Alps are one of the most heavily built-up mountain regions in Europe. They contain the most important water resources, but their current economic situation makes them vulnerable to global warming. The Alps could play a fundamental role by becoming carbon-neutral by 2050, as defined by the four Environment Ministers of the German-speaking Alpine countries in June this year. They could become the region of choice for creating renewable energy and contributing to achieving the 20% target for 2020. (The speaker broke off) Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive drying-up of the Jordan River is a direct consequence of the tragedy that Palestine is experiencing. Water is a highly political issue. Let us not forget that. Let us remember some facts: the World Bank informs us that, for two years, the one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been without chlorine, which is essential for disinfecting the water; 50% of homes did not have access to water before the bombings of January 2009, so imagine what it is like now. Médecins sans Frontières
 say that, now, following the attacks by the Israeli army on the infrastructure, 90% of the water supplied to the inhabitants is unfit for human consumption. Every day, 80 million litres of untreatable sewage is discharged into our Mediterranean as a result of the destruction inflicted on the infrastructure in Gaza. It is true that Baroness Ashton has visited Gaza on several occasions, but where is the political courage to apply to Israel the same standards as we have in Europe? Must clean water, like the land, be monopolised by the Israeli settlers? Consequently, the European Union must suspend the association agreement with the current Israeli Government, which remains deaf to all our requests, whilst the occupation and the settlements, which are illegal, remain. Without justice, there will be no peace. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the situation imposed on the Roma – their expulsion and the denial of their right to free movement in Europe – is unacceptable and goes against European values. However, this situation is but the symptom of a more serious and more general problem. It is merely the reflection of a disease in our so-called modern societies, where we are losing sight of what binds us together as human beings. No, human beings are not commodities that can be stocked and destocked. The policy that we, as the European Union, follow on issues relating to the movement of persons within the Union and to entry and exit from third countries is unacceptable. We cannot pursue this policy of a besieged and timid Europe. The free movement of persons is fundamental. It has always been so, and it is the foundation on which our present-day societies are built. Today, equality is no longer guaranteed where the movement of European and non-European citizens is concerned. While European tourists and pensioners travel freely and in huge numbers to the South, especially to the Maghreb, the citizens of those same countries are unable to move around. The Schengen visas and their application by the EU Member States are inhuman. The considerable barriers to movement prevent citizens of the South from coming to the countries of the North as tourists, friends or family members. President Barroso, what action – bold, concrete action – are you going to take to enable us to adhere to our values once again on this issue? Malika Benarab-Attou

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean has never been as vital to our future as it is today. Together we have tried, in the report on the UfM, to support a different vision of our Mediterranean. More than just a simple free trade zone, it is a Union founded on the common civilisation of people who share fundamental values. I should like to talk about the most serious obstacle to our Mediterranean ambitions; the violence suffered by the Palestinian people, who are being occupied, expelled and killed by Israel, while Europe fails to assume its historic responsibility in this conflict and really act for peace by recognising the State of Palestine in accordance with the international laws on which our democracies are founded. This coming week, an official Parliament delegation will visit the Gaza Strip in a bid to understand why aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro which Europeans are sending Palestinians is not arriving in the schools and hospitals in Gaza, which I visited in January. I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided, without informing either his members – of whom I am one – or the co-chairs of this delegation, not to visit Gaza with Parliament’s delegation on the instructions of the Israeli Embassy. By boycotting Parliament’s delegation to Gaza, our committee chair is discrediting the whole of Parliament, which passed a resolution on the Goldstone report condemning the fact that contacts with the populations in Gaza were being blocked by the Israeli army and demanding that the block be lifted immediately. We need to remember this resolution and Parliament’s position. This being so, I call for Mr Albertini to resign as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, for failing to meet the demands of his office. What is the point of financing and supervising elections, if we then refuse to recognise those who have chosen the ballot box over arms? Finally, another obstacle to a really fraternal Union for the Mediterranean is the victims who drown on their way from the south side, partly due to the fact that European borders are completely closed to them. Our current migration policy is no longer acceptable. We need to be able, as the UNDP recommends, to ensure that the mobility of citizens from the South is equal to our own mobility to the South. We must be faithful to our project and to our values. Our children will thank us for it and we will be the proud representatives of our peoples. Malika Benarab-Attou,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the value of this report in opening up the debate, within our Parliament, on the position and role of universities in Europe. These universities must, in fact, be encouraged to participate in European integration from the inside rather than to contemplate it from the outside. Over the course of European history, universities have always been places where meetings are held, knowledge is exchanged, thought is developed and training is delivered in the various disciplines. Today, the effects of the crisis and of unemployment must not result in universities restricting their role as providers of professionals who are immediately ready to work because, in our changing societies, the ability to change jobs is becoming vital. On the contrary, universities, as places of higher education and training, must also enable learners to become critical, analytical thinkers, because this will enable them to understand the world in which we live and to use their professional skills wisely. European universities must create the conditions for lifelong learning, contribute to the enrichment of intellectual life and play a central role in the knowledge-based society of today’s digital age.

Mr President, President of the European Investment Bank, in the EIB’s 2008 report, Parliament insisted that the bank’s external activities comply with the general objectives of the European Union. That is why the project to finance a nuclear power station in Jordan would go against the foundations of Article 3(5) of the Treaty on European Union. I quote, ‘In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the sustainable development of the Earth’. In February 2009, the Jordanian authorities contacted the EIB seeking support for their nuclear energy development project, which involves, in particular, the construction of a nuclear power station by 2016. It is therefore with some satisfaction that I have received the assurance of your services that the European Investment Bank did not grant this request and that it considers that its job is to support projects in Jordan aimed at developing wind and solar power, which are energies of the future for our planet because they are renewable. Will this position be pursued for other requests to finance nuclear power stations? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europeana project is taking on a new, ambitious dimension. With this EU digital library, the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible. It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project. A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. One of our continent’s horizons is Africa, but we have blackened that horizon with slavery and colonialism. We have a duty of recognition and reparation towards its peoples. Financial compensation could not meet this need alone, but thanks to the Europeana project, we can help to return to the African peoples part of their culture in terms of its oral literature. Amadou Hampâté Bâ, a Malian intellectual, said: ‘In Africa, when an old person dies, it is a library that burns’. Working to digitise works of oral literature, which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists, and encouraging free access to them through the Europeana project, thereby making them universal in scale, would be a way of protecting and giving life to humanity’s cultural diversity, to which we are all attached.

 Mr President, I am wondering what actions the European Union will introduce to ensure that all Member States observe the right of asylum and respect the human rights of people arriving from the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Many of them are arriving in flimsy craft, and several thousand Africans are drowning without anyone protesting. Are the Council and the Commission really sensitive to these issues, which fall under the headings of both human rights and humanitarian aid? Mr Moratinos’s statements with regard to the strengthening of the security approach and the additional resources allocated to Frontex, decided recently by the Council, do not reassure me in this regard. Ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to act to bring our actions into line with our values. This is urgent, because there are lives at risk. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, on 14 January, I met with members of the Tunisian delegation. We had a frank exchange and debated our respective views. As a Franco-Algerian, I am committed to the Maghreb and I campaign for a united, pluralist and democratic Maghreb. The issue of human rights is crucially important to me, and it is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. The debate on this issue, as it appears in Tunisia, is crucial and relevant. Yesterday morning, I met Mr Ben Brik’s wife, who is leading a hunger strike, as well as activists from the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, and I am concerned. It seems that Mr Ben Brik’s life is in danger due to his illness and his detention conditions. I am sure you realise that if this concern should become a reality, the responsibility will fall very heavily on the shoulders of the Tunisian authorities. Aside from trade relations, we must also take account of social issues. The phenomenon of young Tunisians throwing themselves into the Mediterranean is the product of a closed society that offers no prospects to its young people. The defence against fundamentalism and economic imperatives must not serve as pretexts for ignoring human rights. Real progress in the field of human rights is now crucial. We are not talking here about sanctimonious dogmatism but about an urgent situation that the European Union must help to resolve. Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr Barroso, I would like to inform you that, in a few days’ time, we will be observing the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The situation of the crushed, colonised, wounded, killed Palestinian population must not continue. We Europeans, through our values of solidarity and fraternity, have a responsibility to find a solution to this situation quickly, before it turns into a bloodbath. The Israeli Government is continuing its colonisations by forced march, and this after it committed war crimes at the start of this year. Symbols and tears are no longer enough. Today, the only solution to stop this deadly policy of the Israeli Government is the recognition and, above all, the existence of the Palestinian State. The Palestinian people, like other peoples, have a right to a dignified existence that fulfils their aspirations. As President of the Commission, and together with Mrs Ashton, will you take action along these lines and, if so, how? Malika Benarab-Attou  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied by the response that Commissioner Dimas was able to give on this issue and, in particular, by his speaking of the importance of aid beyond the borders of our continent. In addition to environmental protection of the Mediterranean Sea, might one formally propose, as part of the Union for the Mediterranean project, this emergency aid in the event of fire and the development of forestry expertise on this subject, to be shared and developed with the non-European countries of the Union for the Mediterranean? Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioners, in my view there has been an extraordinary degree of misinformation during this debate. Why? Because, in the first instance, we had an exhibition – I think Polish Members arranged it – that looks as if it is on the part of citizens but, when you look more closely, it turns out it is financed by a coalition of shale gas industry associations. I would say that is false advertising; it is masquerading as something it is not! That is the problem we have with this exhibition. Secondly, you may have forgotten, but the Commissioners mentioned it, there are reports which the Commission requested. I would ask you to read them carefully, because the report on the environment shows all too clearly that there is a risk of polluting surface water and groundwater and of depleting water resources. The impact on the soil can be devastating and can also lead to atmospheric pollution. Yet people say there are no such risks. It is not a question of being for or against shale gas, because decisions on energy mix are a question of national sovereignty. Our task, as elected officials, as MEPs, is to protect the European public. These reports show that there are clearly identified shortcomings in the legislation: poor adaptation of the Water Framework Directive, management of waste needs to be integrated into the Mining Waste Directive, and fracking needs to be integrated into the Environmental Impact Assessments Directive. If we do not overcome these failings, we will face serious difficulties, as seen in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, companies should be fully liable. They should have to prove that they have sufficient financial guarantees to honour the polluter pays principle in the event of environmental damage. It is not up to industry to decide what our energy future will be, but up to the citizens. Finally, with the support of around a hundred MEPs, we have tabled an amendment calling for a moratorium on fracking in the European Union. I hope as many MEPs as possible will remember their responsibilities when it comes to voting and will show that lobbyists do not hold all the power in Brussels.

 Mr President, Mr Grzyb, I would like to stress that Poland is in breach of the Water Framework Directive. You have already been asked to adhere to the standards laid down in that directive. The second problem with fracking is its social acceptability. The Commissioner mentioned this earlier. When people are made aware that exploitation comes with risks, it is still up to them to decide, as was the case in France and Bulgaria. At the same time, in relation to the risk presented by CO2
, which came up just now, shale gas cannot replace all sources of energy. You have to develop renewables. Europe is doing just that, Commissioner Oettinger spoke about it, and you also have the opportunity to do so in Poland. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I have a similar question. The problem with this exhibition is not that industrialists want to hold an exhibition. There’s no problem with that, but they must say that they are industrialists. When we have NGOS, they say they are NGOs. The problem here is the attempt to deceive us: we do not know who they really are, and when you scratch beneath the surface, as Mr Turmes said, you find out they are actually from the shale gas industry. That is what is not right and not the fact that lobbies can come to Parliament to try to influence people. There must be total transparency about who people are. Michèle Rivasi,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group
. – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since we are going to give our opinion this week on the discharge of European agencies that are under suspicion about their management, since our institutions are deemed to be too open to the lobbies and it seems that the transparency measures taken so far have not succeeded in resolving these problems, since we rightly want exemplary, certified institutions without any conflicts of interest, since the Commission’s reputation is once again in tatters, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but also on behalf of numerous other Members of the European Parliament of all political persuasions, I want to ask you about the resignation of John Dalli and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, which has been planned for a long time. This unexpected affair is intriguing and has left me somewhat bewildered. There is something fishy about this alleged story of corruption and we have the right to find out all the details. Of course, Commissioners must not be above the law. They must answer for themselves like any other citizen. However, nor must Commissioners must be beneath the law and I have the feeling that John Dalli is being deprived of basic rights and, in particular, the presumption of innocence while there is no concrete and direct proof of his guilt. Several questions come to mind, therefore, and I would like the Commission to give us some insight into this affair. What legal provision, what regulation or what Treaty has Mr Dalli infringed with his behaviour? What is the Commission’s view of his alleged guilt? Is it not possible that this affair might be a manoeuvre to derail the Tobacco Products Directive? Commissioner, I would ask you to give us some details about this extraordinary situation and I call on OLAF to send us its report as soon as possible Moreover, I read Mr Barroso’s letter assuring us that the Tobacco Products Directive would not be postponed. However, we would like more information about the timetable, which is already more than a year behind. This long-awaited Directive is ready and I would ask the Commission to make every effort to implement it. Are we going to have to wait until Tonio Borg takes up his post? We believe that this is extremely urgent from a health perspective and that the Directive should therefore get back on track, because if we do not do it now, it will have to wait until the next parliamentary term. Who will win in that case? The tobacco lobby! Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially Mr Áder and Mr Seeber, for their valuable work on the revision of the Seveso Directive. As we debate the Seveso Directive, my thoughts turn to the accident that occurred in France, AZF – you will recall – in Toulouse. On 21 September 2001, a stock of ammonium nitrate exploded killing 31 people and wounding a further 2 500, who are still traumatised to this day. The damage caused was unbelievable. This was not due to the lack of risk assessment management. It was due to the subcontracting of subcontractors, that is to say, untrained people. The training of employees is also the best form of security. In any event, give or take a few minor details, I am pleased with the final result, in particular, the essential advances in the management of industrial risks, against which we need to protect our citizens in the race to underinvestment in safety features by integrating the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. This is very important for informing citizens in the interests of transparency, and it is a sine qua non
 of the organisation of an effective risk management plan. I have one reservation, Commissioner, which is that there is no assessment of the financial consequences of a major accident and proof of the capacity of companies to address them. That, in my opinion, is a shortcoming of this directive. Michèle Rivasi,

 Mr President, it is good that we have this resolution on water because it is proof of Parliament’s good intentions. I would like to highlight some problems. Firstly, in terms of water management. As we speak, the World Water Forum is being held in Marseille. Yet, as you know, there is strong criticism with regard to the conflict of interest arising from the fact that the president of this World Water Forum, Loïc Fauchon, is also the chief executive of the Marseille water service (Société des eaux de Marseille
), an affiliate of Veolia. This has therefore become a commercial forum rather than a general interest to see water become a shared global resource. In terms of water management, it is very important that water management is reallocated to local authorities under direct state supervision. This forum ended with a declaration claiming that private investment can guarantee the right to water, which logically leads the debate towards the privatisation of water systems. This is a problem for both European and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The second problem concerns water and health. When we see that 88% of the diseases in the world come from drinking dirty water, poor hygiene practices or inadequate sanitation services, we must seriously invest in the treatment of industrial waste water and waste water in particular, which are poured untreated into nature. This, nevertheless, represents 70% of waste water. My final point relates to water and energy. We cannot replace water. Yet, as you know, the problem of shale gas management may lead to problems with groundwater pollution, hence the importance of the framework directive on groundwater, where they realised in Canada and the United States that it could cause pollution. Therefore, if we are fighting for water quality, we must do so at all levels. Michèle Rivasi,

Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, and the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Polish Presidency on their constructive work. From now on, consumers will be guaranteed better information. Ms Ries spoke about the sofas imported from Asian countries that contained fungicides and we all know the consequences these had for consumers, including extensive skin problems and severe erythema. Consumers should absolutely have been informed that items had been treated, but that was not the case until now. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is essential to reinforce the substitution of highly dangerous active substances by strengthening the exclusion criteria but also by limiting the derogations and introducing national guarantees for the adjustment of the conditions of use of product authorisations. We welcome, too, Commissioner, the specific and detailed provisions on nanomaterials, which you mentioned. This is a very important matter because we will be informed, there will be labelling, and substances such as nano-silver will have to be specifically authorised and assessed separately, which is justification for the validity of the methods used for the supporting assessment. The only damper on things – as has been mentioned – is that Parliament has lost its right of veto regarding the approval of active substances. It would seem that that was the price we had to pay for these improvements. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would actually like to inform my fellow Members, since we were there with Ms Herczog in Cadarache, that the ITER project is not insured. Since we are trying to keep the ITER budget under control, I have asked the question twice, and I have been told: ‘But it is not … (The President asked the speaker to ask her question)
 Please can you explain why the ITER project is not insured? Who will pay if there is an accident? Will France alone have to pay? As it is an international project, I would have preferred all the states to contribute. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would like to raise two points that I feel are important. When we talk about generating electricity using this fusion, rather than fission reactor, we are talking about starting in 2100. Therefore, it is not really the most important priority at present. Secondly, people have been talking about keeping the budget under control, and I completely agree. The only problem is that in 2006, the budget was EUR 5 billion, whereas in 2011 it is EUR 15 billion: in other words, three times higher. On top of this, because of Fukushima the Japanese are now saying they will not be able to meet their commitments in two years’ time. This means that ITER will be delayed by another two years. A third factor, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, is that this is the first time that a facility like ITER, which entails certain risks, primarily of disruption – and I would invite you to read the studies that have been written on the subject – has not been insured. Why will the Indians, the Chinese and the Russians not insure it? It is because they do not want to increase the ITER budget any further. We are therefore setting ourselves on a collision course, and it would be better to stop now, rather than pour billions into a project that supposedly will be ready by 2100. For this reason, it is time we put an end to ITER. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I am grateful to Ms Ford for the work she has done, but I would like to point out that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution, one of the key points of which concerns the protection of sensitive natural areas, and specifically the Arctic. Indeed, granting exploration or exploitation licences means accepting liability, in the event of an accident of the kind we saw in the Gulf of Mexico and also in Scotland, for irreversible or very destructive damage in this unique part of the world. Furthermore, one is entitled to ask who is going to clean up this site in the event of an accident, since it is not an exclusive economic zone, and who defines its borders and hence the responsibilities relating to it: it is an area that belongs to everyone. I should like to draw my fellow Members’ attention to a number of points, the first of which is supervision. Supervision needs to be enhanced, but it would be good if it were carried out at European level and if the Maritime Safety Agency were responsible for it. Secondly, responsibilities need to be clearly defined. Amendment 76 establishes the full liability of oil companies, without any upper limit. At the same time, Amendment 47 defines civil liability, which covers not only environmental damage, but also social and economic damage, with guaranteed financial capacity to cover mandatory insurance. Including small oil companies in our deliberations is all well and good, but if they do not have any insurance, there is no point in granting them a licence. These points are therefore very important. Michèle Rivasi,

 Madam President, with what is happening with e.coli at the moment in Germany, France and other countries, I am a little surprised to note that it could be agued that, now we have solved the problem of animal-based meal, we should be able to give it to non-ruminants, including pigs, poultry and fish. To start with, I used to think that we do in fact have a lot of animal-based meal and that we could give it to all non-ruminants and herbivores, eliminate everything to give it to omnivores or carnivores. In fact, however, I see that, even if there were a whole set of constraints in place, we would not succeed. How are we going to monitor the existence of differentiated sectors? Let us take the example of a farm on which poultry and cattle co-exist. There will be animal-based meal for the poultry and other food for the cattle. The operator can easily make a mistake and give to the cattle what he gave to the poultry; there will be no guarantee, even if monitoring is carried out. I therefore asked a number of scientists, who told me that, as regards the problem of prion, which caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, there were still a huge number of scientific uncertainties. As far as consumers are concerned therefore – I know, Mr Dalli, that you are highly sensitive to the health of consumers – we must regain their confidence. You saw what happened with e.coli and you know the story about the cucumber. We learned that the cucumber was not to blame. I cannot see how, at the present time, farmers can be authorised to give animal-based meal to pigs and poultry. I believe that the solution is to say that our scientific knowledge is incomplete, draconian control and monitoring cannot be carried out, even if it is written into the texts, and that, as a precaution, it is better to place a ban on the feeding of animal-based meal to all animals.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire 
stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors. We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting. 80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors. Furthermore, we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risks. When we look at these stress tests as they relate to France, they become ‘relaxation tests’. Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France. This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue, but must be a European issue, the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I would nevertheless like to remind my fellow Members that the Fukushima accident is not over and that there are still risks of explosion relating to the molten core. I have a question to put to our Commissioner, Mr Oettinger. It is about the implementation of these stress tests. As our fellow Member has just said, how will you get a guarantee that all the criteria that you have mentioned to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are taken into account by each Member State that uses nuclear power stations? How will you force a Member State to allow independent experts to verify and monitor the power stations if it refuses? The reason I ask this is that, if they monitor themselves, I do not see how we will apply your stress tests. There absolutely must be an independent body monitoring the power stations in each Member State. How, furthermore, will we ensure that neighbouring countries – you spoke of Armenia, with Metsamor, and of other countries such as Belarus, and so on – accept such monitoring? Parliament will have to support you, Commissioner, but how will we do this? Finally, we have a real responsibility to phase out nuclear power, and this is where scenarios for achieving this must be proposed to Parliament. It is the only guarantee that there will be no further accidents. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, first of all something positive, Mr Barroso. I welcome the fact that you are going to adjust the European maximum levels in line with Japan’s levels, because at the time of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011, we realised that the levels proposed by the Commission were far too high. I welcome this therefore, and would like to see it incorporated into this regulation. My second point concerns imports of food products from Japan. There is a fundamental issue here. Are we going to be obliged to have contaminated food, although the contamination is below the maximum levels, in order to support the Japanese economy? I am sure you have children. I think to myself, am I going to give my children milk containing 500 Bq of iodine when there is an alternative milk with 0 Bq of iodine? I wonder if the Commission should perhaps consider blocking food and feed imported from Japan because it may be contaminated and instead help and support the Japanese people themselves, either financially or with uncontaminated foodstuffs. Lastly, I have an appeal to make to you Mr Barroso. I have been approached by Areva, who have travelled to Japan where their equipment had been blocked and is in storage at the airport. It is very important for you, if possible, to request the Japanese Government to release the equipment: the whole system including masks, robots and so on that has been blocked at the airport.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I fully endorse what Mrs Lepage has said and I would ask the following question: is it an opportunity or a predictable ecological disaster? We are nonetheless 10 years behind the United States in terms of exploitation. What can we see? We can see that the groundwater has been contaminated by the chemicals that have permeated this hydraulic fracturing. We can also see air pollution. We can now see that there are volatile organic compounds (VOC) and even ozone has appeared because of all the substances released into the air. We can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and, of course, the users of the phreatic nappes, because they can no longer drink the water they contain. Last week, the New York Times reported that, as well as polluting the groundwater with hydrocarbons and biocides, the contamination also emits radioactive elements. In France, as Mrs Lepage pointed out, eight licences were signed without any debate, without any consultation, without any impact assessment. And you talk of social acceptability? There is genuine rebellion. The latest demonstrations in the département of Ardèche were attended by more than 20 thousand people precisely because they care about their land. And you say, ‘It is an economic opportunity’. But whom does this gas benefit? Are we talking about cui bono
? Is it about choosing gas for the needs of industry to the detriment of the reserves of water in the phreatic nappes? The New York moratorium is a good illustration of the problem. We are therefore simply requesting that the licences be revoked. For explorations to take place while we have no guarantee of compliance with the Groundwater Framework Directive, the Air Quality Framework Directive or the Aarhus Convention is out of the question. We therefore await your responses and we will refuse, in Europe, in France and in the countries involved, to allow these non-conventional forms of gas to be exploited in the absence of these guarantees.

 Mr President, we all remember that H1N1 influenza was big news in 2009. The first cases were reported almost two years ago – on 25 March 2009 – and the WHO declared a phase 6 alert level on 11 June 2009. This maximum alert level issued by the WHO triggered a series of measures in Europe, including the activation of immunisation campaigns in several Member States which not only were very costly but were also overestimated in relation to the known severity of the virus, which, as the WHO stated at that time in May 2009, was moderate. As regards severity, up to the end of April 2010, this flu had caused around 2 900 deaths in Europe, in other words, a much lower mortality rate than that related to seasonal flu, which causes an estimated 40 000 - 220 000 deaths per year depending on the year. Meanwhile, the estimated costs were close to EUR 1.3 billion in the United Kingdom and over EUR 700 million in France according to the latest Court of Auditors report. The evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza shows that there was a disproportionate response in the European Union and the Member States. I and my colleagues, whom I would like to thank for their amendments, have therefore tried to produce a constructive report which aims to restore the confidence of European citizens in their health institutions. The report is structured around three major themes: cooperation, transparency and independence. In terms of cooperation, we are keen to stress the need for coherence, effectiveness, autonomy and flexibility. Future flu prevention plans, for example, must be revised in such a way as to guarantee greater coherence and effectiveness and must be made self-contained and flexible enough that they can be adapted in real time according to the latest available data. This kind of flexibility would have saved our public purses a good deal of unnecessary expense. At the same time, it is important to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the key players responsible for managing health risks. The definition of a pandemic itself must be revised so that it includes the concept of severity and does not just take account of geographical spread. Indeed, the WHO has informed us that it has this in hand. Group purchasing of vaccines is a possibility, provided that the manufacturers remain liable for the quality, safety and efficacy of their products. Under no circumstances must governments be made liable for side effects of vaccines that are supposed to be safe. As regards independence, the fast-track authorisation procedure has highlighted the problem of the lack of available scientific data. Research into vaccines and antiviral treatments must be conducted with complete independence from the pharmaceutical companies. In terms of transparency, total transparency is needed concerning the evaluation of drugs used for health emergencies, with full access to the clinical trials available. All declarations of interest on the part of the experts responsible for the evaluations must be made public. I have one regret: I would have preferred them to be checked by the agencies who recruit these experts, but this amendment was not adopted. Finally, I would like to highlight the cases of narcolepsy that have been reported in children in Finland and Sweden following vaccination with GSK’s H1N1 influenza vaccine. These cases need our attention. In the first instance, they clearly demonstrate that there are still grey areas, both in relation to the actual toxicity of the vaccines and adjuvants and in relation to possible risks as yet unknown to the manufacturers themselves. Finland has suspended the use of this vaccine until more information is available. This is not the position of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has decided instead to wait until more information is available before issuing any opinion on restricting the use of this vaccine. I would like to see the Commission adopt the same position as Finland. It is time that the precautionary principle benefited patients for once instead of always benefiting the companies.

Madam President, having participated in the observation mission to Haiti last September, I was able to realise the emergencies to be dealt with. Now we have to look beyond these emergencies to finally reach the development stage. We do not have to reconstruct but rather to construct a country whose foundations and governance have never been strong. One thing is clear, as my fellow Members have said: there are 20 million tonnes of rubble to clear and only 5%, a minute part, has been cleared in a year. At this rate, it will take more than six years to clear the ruins in Port-au-Prince. It is therefore a political project in itself and the Commission has to contribute to it. Another priority is governance and I am pleased that the European Union is making a major contribution to budgetary support for the country. We have to increase this financial effort because it is the only means of restoring competences to the Haitian country and people. Its current dependency on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is seen at the level of basic public services such as health and education. We must not, however, subcontract all public services to NGOs. Above all, we have to increase our support to organise elections quickly and complete these elections, which, I hope, should enable a corrupt political elite to be replaced. At present, an oligarchy of allegedly 20 families prevents any economic development because it controls trade but, at the same time, does nothing to develop the country’s production capacity. Finally, we have to give Haiti the resources to emerge from the dependency that was already undermining it even before the earthquake. Therefore, I call upon European institutions to establish consistent priorities and to give massive support to setting up public services with strong commitment from the future Haitian Government.

Mr President, on the subject of this text that we voted for, I would like to draw your attention – and I must congratulate Mrs McAvan for the quality of her work – to an omission regarding guinea pig populations. In fact, there is one point that has been neglected, which, on account of the agreement concluded in first reading, could not be the subject of an oral amendment: it is a question of people used as guinea pigs for clinical tests of a medicine or vaccine conducted before authorisation in order to check its harmlessness or its risk-benefit balance. These people may include men, women, children or elderly people; in this text, we are concerned with the follow-up of the possible side-effects of drugs for human use. In fact, it must be pointed out that these people who participate in clinical tests are kept in ignorance as regards the substance ingested or injected and that the effects are only likely to be triggered ten, twenty or thirty years later. These guinea pigs are the forgotten people of pharmacovigilance and it is important to remember this and mention it. Michèle Rivasi,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

Mr President, I am going to take one minute and I shall speak for a further minute afterwards. I should like to speak first as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, for this report. I should like to say that it is very important in this sector to provide patients with better protection and better information, but also to fight against the stranglehold exerted by the pharmaceutical industry, which wanted to collect reports of side effects and to analyse and interpret the results. At the level of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – and, moreover, at the level of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – we therefore succeeding in ensuring that, when it comes to the collection of reports, doctors and patients will be the ones able to report side effects for transmission to the national authorities. As far as analysis and interpretation are concerned, the Member States are responsible for detecting and monitoring the adverse reactions of medicinal products. It transpired, in connection with the outbreak of H1N1 influenza, that it was the Swedish national authorities which referred to narcolepsy even though, until now, the H1N1 vaccine had not been associated with such side effects. This is very important. On the other hand, I am very disappointed that we have not achieved financial independence from the national authorities. Finally, as far as controls are concerned, there has been real progress in relation to this Pharmacovigilance Committee, which is separate from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and I hope that there will also be more information available for patients, either on package leaflets or in terms of ultra-vigilance. Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, I would like to come back to the environmental impact of medicinal products. Since 1965, Europe has established criteria for obtaining marketing authorisations. There are three criteria, namely efficacy, safety and the pharmaceutical quality of the medicinal product, but there is nothing about the environmental impact of medicinal products. As you know, the oestrogen found in river waters is changing the sex of fish. As you also know, there are high levels of residues of medicinal products in purification plants and in waste water from hospitals. There has been a fair amount of discussion on this matter; a debate has been held and, in the Pharmacovigilance Directive, it has finally been taken into account in the form of a recital calling on the Commission to publish a report, on the basis of data provided by the European Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Member States, on the scale of the problem and an assessment of whether or not it would be appropriate or useful to amend EU legislation on medicinal products or in other areas. What I want of the Commission is a proper report based on these data, because this indirectly affects human health in that, in numerous cases, it is the consumption of water that caused the side effects identified.

Mr President, I consider that progress has been made in this text, including on two fundamental aspects: the need for labelling if nanoparticles are present in a product and, more importantly, the fact that each of these nanosubstances will also be subject to separate evaluation, which is not currently the case. Progress has also been made in terms of the possibility of excluding endocrine disrupters from substances used, with specific and properly applicable exclusion criteria. But – there is a but – we disagree on the actual resources for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), because that agency’s mission should be to evaluate and authorise biocidal products. However, we have just extended the ECHA’s mission; we agree with that, but extending it means giving the ECHA the resources to really do its job. We cannot ask the ECHA to do a lot more work, to reduce substance evaluation times, while, at the same time, reducing its resources. If we do so, we risk coming up against simplified assessments, which may well be fast, but which will be superficial and therefore inadequate. That is why I call on you, Mrs Klaß, to reconsider your budgetary proposal concerning the ECHA missions in this dossier. As it stands, I must say that your proposal is not a serious one, and this will affect the standard of work of that European institution, which is essential to the safety of European citizens and consumers. This is an important issue. You cannot demand more if the resources are not available, or else the ECHA will just be an administrative agency which responds to the industrial lobby.

 Mr President, I would like to make the connection between the scanner, health and terrorism. What does the Interagency Committee on Radioprotection, which brings together the European Commission, the IAEA – the International Atomic Energy Agency – and the Nuclear Energy Agency say? It says that pregnant women and children must not be subjected to body scans, even if the doses are extremely small. Indeed, we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations. My question therefore concerns justification of the risks. Given the existence of alternative technologies that enable the same goals to be achieved, these scanners really do need to be justified in relation to the given objective, and we need to know … (The President cut off the speaker) Michèle Rivasi  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, for my part, would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine. Currently, the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation, and I would like to share a number of concerns with you. Firstly, what is the relationship between the risks and benefits? At the moment, the benefits are few, since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths – nowhere near as many as seasonal flu, in any case. With regard to the risks, on the other hand, we have enough time to consider this aspect, and I would like, in particular, to address the problem of adjuvants. I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd: in the United States, the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited, but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene. The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype. I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Mr President, the current situation of migrants is a legacy of the past. With this motion for a resolution, we wish to galvanise the new Libyan Government to action with regard to migrants’ rights and to make clear that we would like very much and are prepared to assist it in establishing new policies towards migrants and asylum seekers, as this is a crucial issue. Non-governmental organisations working in Libya have reported numerous human rights violations, including sexual violence towards children and women.  Finally, in order to ensure better protection of migrants’ rights, it is vital that Libya, which has successfully started out on the path to democracy, should draw a line under the past and the legacy of the dictatorship by ratifying international conventions, including, of course, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the political message of this report, which calls on the European Union to make signature of the EU-Kazakhstan enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement dependent on progress on democracy, respect for human rights and freedom of the press. I condemn the decision of the Appellate Court in Aktau to sentence the opposition politician Vladimir Kozlov to seven and a half years in prison. His trial, monitored closely by the international community, has been described as staged, as a ‘Soviet-style’ trial. There is absolutely no concrete evidence against Mr Kozlov. He is accused of having spoken out against his country when abroad, in particular in his speeches in the European Parliament. It is unacceptable for opponents and defenders of human rights invited to Parliament to be at risk once they return home and even imprisoned.

Mr President, if this new generation is not given pens, they will be given guns by terrorists. Those are the words of Malala, who, at the age of 14, understands fully that educating children and combating obscurantism go hand in hand. Besides the case of this young Pakistani girl, who has become a symbol, I would remind you that young girls in Afghanistan have to deal with this unacceptable situation every day. The extensive violence to which they are subjected no longer makes the headlines, as it did 10 years ago, when we wanted to justify our military action in Afghanistan on the grounds of emancipating Afghan women. I must therefore repeat it again: we cannot forget them. That is the message that the Afghan parliamentarians wanted to get across when they visited the European Parliament a few weeks ago. They fear that in 2014, after the ISAF forces withdraw, the rights they have obtained over this last decade will quite simply be exchanged for a return to calm during the negotiations between the Afghan Government and the Taliban. For that reason, we must continue to condemn tirelessly these archaic practices. Above all, however, the European Union must provide financial support for the local women’s associations who are fighting to keep the schools open. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask you if you are aware of the reports of the European Union’s ambassadors and delegations in Jerusalem, which have stated clearly in recent years that we cannot guarantee the traceability of products from Israel and thus identify and distinguish products from the settlements. I would like to know if you are aware of these reports because I am astonished that you say that products from the settlements are not involved. In addition, have you also heard that in many countries, and mine in particular, consumers regularly spot products from the settlements on our markets? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is not a simple technical agreement. It means stronger EU-Israeli relations and free access to Europe’s single market even though the EU decided in 2009 to suspend the upgrading of its economic relations with Israel. Supporting this agreement means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal settlement of the Palestinian territories; it means acknowledging and encouraging the illegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza. The reports by our ambassadors in Jerusalem recommend that we adopt binding measures to put an end to the settlements. The European Union has stated that the Israeli settlement policy is an obstacle to peace so, for the sake of consistency, if we adopt the ACAA we should refuse the Nobel Peace Prize.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that we should condemn such a blatant violation of human rights and such an outburst of violence, which serve as a reminder for South Africa of the darkest days of its history. I want to highlight the fact that today, South Africa, which is often lauded as a model of democracy, has an opportunity to show us that it is capable of applying the fundamental principles of this democracy, namely, impartial justice and respect for the rule of law. I am therefore pleased that a committee of inquiry has been established in order to shed light on the tragic events of 16 August, but it seems to me that it is essential that we also condemn the use of common purpose law, a throwback to apartheid, which has only served to crystallise the anger in the country a little more. In South Africa, as in many African states, the wealth of mineral resources is in stark contrast to the rising poverty of part of the population. This part of the population, which is crying out for change, with the fall of the apartheid regime, is, on the contrary, seeing growing social inequalities and a new economic apartheid take root. The sharing of natural resources remains a key issue on the African continent, and multinationals must shoulder their responsibilities in the current conflicts. That is why Europe must promote another kind of economic and human development in these regions, by stopping imports of mining products extracted without social or environmental guarantees. In conclusion, I would add that this situation should give us cause to reflect, because in South Africa, as in other countries around the world, democracy does not simply mean free elections, but also more social justice.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on this excellent result. The compromise reached between the institutions paves the way for real progress on uniting the European continent to help particularly vulnerable people who are the victims of crime. This directive will reinforce a series of measures implemented at European level to promote the free movement and the defence of victims of crime, such as the European protection order. We can welcome the result of this trialogue, for example, the definition of gender-based violence, even though it only appears in the recitals rather than the articles. We must also welcome the fact that all victims have been included, regardless of their status, particularly their residence status. From now on, the most vulnerable people will have the right, in European territory, to protection and consideration of their needs. The text recognises the impact of crime, not only on the victim, but also on close family members, including children. Despite these advances, I would like to underline the need to consider violence against women as a social phenomenon as such and, like a number of my colleagues, I call on the Commission to prepare a specific directive on this issue.

 I welcome the adoption of this resolution on EU policy on the occupied Palestinian territories. This text provides a comprehensive account of reality on the ground and openly denounces the rampant expansion of Israeli settlements, the extremism of the settlers, the expulsions and the demolition of Palestinian houses. I welcome the fact that Parliament unequivocally calls on the Israeli authorities to end the expansion of the settlements and once again reiterates the official position of the European Union, which is that Europe will not recognise any unilateral change to the borders of the future state of Palestine. I regret, however, that this resolution lacks ambition. Parliament does not openly recognise that the existing control mechanism – the 2005 technical agreement concluded by the Commission with the Israeli authorities – has never been effectively implemented and that products from the Israeli settlements continue to be imported into the European market labelled ‘made in Israel’. Instead of calling on the Commission to create a new legally binding control mechanism, Parliament is content to request that the Union’s existing legislation be implemented.

 Mr President, the issue of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Africa keeps appearing on the parliamentary agenda, and with good reason. Two thirds of African countries have repressive laws in this area and, as has already been mentioned, South Africa is currently regressing on this issue. Today, I would like to talk to you about the documentary made in Uganda by two women on the situation of LGBT people. During filming, in 2010, David Kato, an iconic figure in the fight of LGBTs in Africa, was assassinated. This documentary then changed dimension, and the message of tolerance and hope it bears must be disseminated as widely as possible. I would therefore like to invite you to see this film, which is entitled Call me Kuchu
, and to encourage its distribution in all Member States to let them know of the fate of the Kuchus and to not let silence make them disappear. I will leave you with this phrase spoken by David Kato: ‘They keep saying we do not exist, but we definitely do’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that in several Member States, including France, it is consumer associations and human rights organisations which carry out controls on the origin of products labelled ‘Made in Israel’, and these groups regularly denounce the presence on our markets of products originating in illegal settlements. It is not a rare occurrence. In a spirit of ethical consumption, civil society therefore tries to ensure the traceability of products imported from Israel, as the European Union has shown that it is incapable of implementing the 2005 technical agreement in accordance with international law. You will understand that I am very sceptical and dubious that you will give us guarantees, as you should, on legally binding provisions ensuring that no more products from the settlements are entering the European market. I should like to point out that, with regard to medicines, the children of Gaza not only do not have medicines, but do not even have access to drinking water or enough food to sustain themselves. I think it is important to keep in mind the global context, which, from a humanitarian and human rights point of view, is a dramatic context, and we cannot content ourselves with simply talking about trade without talking about that.

Mr President, the Sahel region, which has already been severely affected by climate change and weakened by the presence of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), has been destabilised by the war in Libya and the return of heavily armed mercenaries. The risk of a merger between certain Islamist groups and the Tuareg rebellion are concerning but should force us to understand the reasons behind them. The financial austerity policies that have been imposed in Africa for 30 years by international institutions, external interference and the exploitation of natural resources have led to impoverishment. In Mali, the population has barely seen the positive social and economic effects that should have come about through gold production. Mali is the third largest producer of gold in Africa. The Malian mining code does not provide for any restriction on mining companies in terms of environmental and social responsibility. This weakness in the legislation makes Mali extremely attractive. Now uranium is being coveted by a French company, which is drilling and working with absolutely no regard for the population and the environment, causing many inhabitants of the Faléa commune to protest. In Niger, France has been exploiting uranium for 40 years and the situation of the local population has not improved at all. On 25 April, the staff of the Imouraren site initiated a strike to protest against disastrous working conditions, claiming that they were working 12 hours a day. In Niger, 60% of exports rely on uranium, and the country provides close to 40% of the stock for Areva, which plans to develop what will be the second largest uranium mine in the world. Niger is classed as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of the human development index. The local population is mainly Tuareg and has long suffered the almost irreversible health consequences of this irresponsible exploitation: air pollution and contamination of the region’s scarce water resources. In conclusion, Europe must therefore promote further economic and human development in this region. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Vlasák, thank you for that question. I entirely agree with you. That is exactly what I intend to do, what at any rate my political organisation Europe Ecology-The Greens (EELV) is already beginning to do in France: to put pressure on this government so that we change our relationships with Africa in general and, more specifically, with Mali – since this is what we are currently discussing – and Niger.

Mr President, Mr Preda, I agree with all the reasons you have mentioned, but even so you have overlooked what I talked about in my speech.

Madam President, let me tell you about my personal experience in this regard. In the context of decentralised cooperation, I had the opportunity to work with associations in Africa and came face to face with the reality of female genital mutilation, about which Ms De Keyser has just spoken. Our resolution stresses the importance of relying on local authorities and NGOs. Taking into account the realities on the ground is essential in the fight against these practices. For example, in any programme to combat female genital mutilation, it must be borne in mind that, for the women who practise it, it is a professional activity. It is sometimes their only source of income, and I know from experience that many of these women are more than willing to abandon the practice if they are offered reintegration into the labour market. I particularly wanted to share this testimony with you, as it is my personal experience. I would also like to stress the exemplary value of the delegations we send to third countries, which must ensure equal representation, as this is the best way of advancing the cause of gender equality.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, if the NATO summit officially records a decision to pull out of Afghanistan, it might as well be officially recording the defeat of the West. If we were to compare the statements made by NATO and the Council with information coming from Afghan civil society and the NGOs, you would think that they were talking about two different countries: the resurgence of the Taliban, who are champing at the bit to stamp their authority on the entire country and take their revenge on those who collaborated with the West. I refer of course to women, and I remember how, in 2001, the plight of Afghan women was exploited to justify a military intervention that the population had not asked for. After the bombings and destruction, they were promised reconstruction, peace and democracy. They have failed. According to the Minister, Mr Eftekhari, 6 million children are suffering from extreme poverty, abuse and violence. Under pressure from the Taliban, schools have been burned, teachers threatened and killed. Nearly 550 girls’ schools have closed their doors in 11 provinces. Young people flee the country to come to the West, the land of promise. There is no point dwelling on the reception or rather the lack of reception waiting for them in Europe: we should be ashamed of ourselves. In addition, Pakistan and Iran have decided to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from their countries. Given the EU’s commitment to the Afghan people, are we prepared, Baroness Ashton, at Council level and in the European External Action Service (EEAS), to adopt a plan to help and take in these refugees? Will we welcome and support the threatened teachers, the women’s rights activists, all those who have put their trust in us and who have to choose … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues and to express my gratitude for the very interesting contributions I have received for this report which, I hope, will be the start of a growing awareness on the part of our institutions. In an ideal Parliament, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality would not exist and issues relating to gender and discrimination against women would be spontaneously integrated into all the matters we deal with here, because this is a cross-cutting issue. However, it is necessary to continue to drive the point home without any let-up because we Members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have a responsibility to remove women from the blind spot of European policies. This is particularly true of environmental issues. I would even go so far as to say that we will show in our report that women are not the green plants of ecology. The figures are staggering. Women are 14 times more likely to die during cyclones, floods and earthquakes. In the tsunami that affected Asia in 2004, for example, and also in the heat wave that hit Europe in 2003, 70% of the victims were women. Why? Women do not have the same resources – economic, social or political – to adapt or even to flee. On the other hand, in Honduras, thanks to a warning and disaster management system which included women from the outset, La Masica was the only town not to record a single death during and after hurricane Mitch. Climate change remains an absolute priority but, in a context of economic crisis, ecology is not the only thing to regress. Women’s rights, too, are eroded and it is by linking the two that we are proposing a coherent political vision and effective solutions. In the past, whenever there was a crisis, whenever there was revolution, we were told that women’s rights would come afterwards. This line of reasoning is out of date and unsound. The challenges of climate change and that of justice and equality for women are intrinsically linked. Women are not only victims to be protected. Women also have knowledge and proposals to make: not because they are, of course, different, but because we live in a society where roles are often gendered. Being a woman or a man has an impact on our daily lives, from the management of resources and access to education to the choice of occupation. These differences in experience are reflected in the solutions and ideas proposed. In the report, we have identified four types of measures. Firstly, measures of representation. We are calling for women’s representation of at least 40% in political, financial and technical bodies. The voice of women and their organisations must be heard and supported. Secondly, measures concerning protection and training, establishing a virtuous cycle for women, from victims to agents of change. Thirdly, measures of education, not only to open up the future green economy and encourage women to pursue scientific and technical careers, but also to support the necessary changes in lifestyle patterns. Finally, as regards research, we need data disaggregated by sex to be collected to improve our understanding of the subject and our policy proposals. To summarise the spirit of this report, we maintain that policies to combat climate change can be enriched through the integration of gender issues and that combating discrimination generates solutions that are more effective for the environment. It is a win-win line of reasoning. As we approach the Rio+20 Summit, it is clear that there are no simple solutions to a challenge as complex and pressing as climate change. It is by broadening our way of thinking that we will find the resources to make a significant change for the better. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I knew, after meeting Commissioner Hedegaard at a hearing organised by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, that we could count on her and on the Commission. I also know that we can count on the Danish Presidency having, in fact, heard a number of proposals. I would like to thank all my colleagues, men and women, who have spoken here today, because what they have said has simply reflected the work we have done collectively, which is very enriching for us all. I think this debate was necessary, and that we must, of course, continue to raise awareness. Each one of us here has contributed to this report and I am very satisfied. I know that we can also rely on the Institute for Gender Equality, which we created in Vilnius in 2011. I should nonetheless like to say something. I would like to pay tribute to all the women and women’s associations worldwide who have long understood that something had to be done about preserving resources and about climate issues. In some countries, women have known this for a long time. In this regard, I will mention India, where, within the Chipko movement, women attached themselves to trees to save them; Rwanda too, where women have preserved 600 kinds of beans. I would also like to pay homage to Wangari Maathai, whom no one here will have forgotten, who left us recently and who, with her Green Belt movement, preserved millions of trees. Women in developing countries recognised the need to take action a long time ago and we know we can count on them. A final point, which has been raised several times, is the issue of quotas. My political group and I, personally, are very much in favour of this tool. It is only a tool, per se
, but it has enabled us to become the only political group with equal representation in this Parliament. I believe it is the only way, unfortunately, to move things forward. If we do not use this tool of allocating quotas, we will not succeed in advancing gender equality. It is simply a tool. Finally, if you will permit me, I shall quote Einstein, who said, ‘Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them’. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, it is true that Kazakhstan is the most open country in Central Asia, economically speaking. European investments are welcome there and companies such as Total, Eni, Areva and Alstom have operations there with major interests. It is also true that Europe is hoping to use this country as a route to transport its troops and military equipment out of Afghanistan. In view of its interests, Europe is remaining discreet and pragmatic towards the Kazakh authorities. However, are we not being too pragmatic at the risk of repeating the same mistakes we made with the Arab world? Moreover, that is what civil society in Kazakhstan, and in the former Soviet Union in general, is convinced that we are doing. We must therefore be attentive to what is actually happening in Kazakhstan. By freeing Ms Sokolova, the lawyer for the trade unionists, and Mr Zhovtis, the human rights defender, the Kazakh authorities are showing proof of goodwill. However, growing and continuing repression of the political opposition, the trade unionists and the independent media persists. Forty-three strikers in Zhanaozen are being threatened with long prison sentences, as are nine members of the opposition, Mr Kozlov, Mr Viniavski and Ms Amirova. We have seen unbelievable censorship of the electronic media to silence all alternative sources of information. Following the orders of the presidential Security Council, 125 websites, judged to be dangerous, have already been blocked, with 168 others on a blacklist. A series of recently promulgated laws tracks this regression in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan: laws on audio-visual material, the Internet and information and a law on religious communities. Although the Kazakh authorities are telling us that they learned their lesson from the tragedy in Zhanaozen, they have just promulgated a law on national security which severely limits freedom of expression and the freedom to change the labour code, which restricts the rights of workers. Are we going to, once again, content ourselves with verbal promises from the Kazakh authorities and continue with business as usual or are we going to openly say to our Kazakh partners that the repression of dissident voices cannot ensure long-term stability? The European Union will, in any case, have to commit to daily monitoring of the upcoming trials of the various strikers and opponents and ensure that the legislative reforms guarantee fundamental freedoms. All of these developments should determine our position on upgrading the partnership with Kazakhstan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, in addressing the issue of quotas, Ms Reding has brought up an old debate on the legitimacy of binding legislative measures. As far as I am concerned, I am fully in favour of proactive, binding measures on the issue that we are considering today, since it is plain that matters are not progressing at all. At university, it has been said that at the top colleges there are brilliant female students who have far higher qualifications than their male colleagues. However, as soon as students enter the world of work, it is clear that difficulties arise and that women are not managing to break through the notorious glass ceiling. At European Union level, we cannot continue to do without the skills of half of the population, once referred to as ‘half of heaven’. What I would like to say to you is that I belong to a political organisation which enshrined equality in its own rules in 1984 in France, and that we have obtained brilliant results. We have had the first female regional president in France. We have had female candidates for the presidential elections. Currently in this Parliament, I am one of eight women elected out of a total of 15 MEPs, making more women than men. I therefore believe that when a decision is taken to move things forward, all that is needed is to take measures such as these in order to achieve equality. I am 100% in favour of these binding measures because parity seems vital to me. This is, quite simply, a question of justice. It is not a question of quotas. I believe that we must talk of parity, and not of quotas. Quotas are 30-40%; they are not justice. Justice is 50:50. I believe that we absolutely must achieve that. Madam President, I would like to propose to you that we should be setting an example, particularly in respect of the Member States; why should we not introduce parity in Parliament’s executive Bureau, from the next term? I think it would be important to start with that step. (Applause) Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to talk to you about Kazakhstan. Did you know that the massive oil workers’ strike which began last May in the province of Mangistau has resulted in brutal repression and the arrest of trade unionists and their lawyer? On 16 December, a peaceful protest at Zhanaozen ended in bloodshed. There were many injuries, at least 15 deaths, as well as arrests and incidents of mistreatment, torture and rape. The legislative elections of 15 January were deemed neither free nor democratic by observers. Finally, human rights defenders and militants from opposition parties recently invited to give their views before the Members of our Parliament were arrested upon their return and are facing long prison sentences. Faced with this authoritarian and repressive abuse, the European Union’s silence is unacceptable. How do you intend to react, Baroness Ashton, to what I have just told you? Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Baroness Ashton stated that human rights should henceforth run as a silver thread throughout all of our external actions. The European Union is one of the main trading partners of Uzbekistan and a major importer of cotton. In view of conditions during the cotton harvest, Parliament is duty-bound to shoulder its moral responsibility and refuse to consent to this agreement as long as Uzbekistan continues to deny access to the independent mission of the International Labour Organisation, and until that mission confirms that reforms have been implemented, bringing an end to forced child labour. For the first time ever, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament can use its new powers and refuse to ratify a trade agreement in the name of human rights. Our action is therefore consistent with the values we defend, and conforms to what is being demanded by NGOs, trade unions and textile retailers’ groups, who are calling for ethical production. The ball is now in the Commission’s court, and it should withdraw the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for Uzbekistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, a great deal has been achieved in the four years since we implemented the EU strategy for Central Asia. The Union has established a continuous political dialogue and regular dialogues on human rights. Initiatives and important programmes have been activated in support of the EU’s seven priority areas. However, in light of the Arab Spring, and in the context of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan, which is already under way, bearing in mind the tragic events of southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, the limitations of our strategy are much more visible today, and this requires a major re-assessment on our part. The strategy is due to be reviewed by the European External Action Service in 2012, and we therefore considered that some key recommendations should be set out in the report, based on the following observation: the EU is unable to reconcile its values and interests in effective programmes that are adapted to the realities and developments in the region. Europe lacks visibility there. Its presence is still in its early stages. The funding devoted to the strategy is modest and would even appear to be under threat. We do not give sufficient open support to civil society, independent media or human rights defenders. Sometimes, in fact, it is pro-government foundations that benefit from European financial support, much to the frustration of genuine NGOs. In the light of this situation, the European Parliament is convinced that it should develop a new EU approach based on human security and regional cooperation. All our actions, projects and initiatives should follow the guiding principle of promoting human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Europe and its Western partners, who are bogged down in the quagmire of Afghanistan and concerned about their military bases in the region, have, for too long, given priority to the stability of the regimes in place rather than human rights. However, stability based on repression does not last long, and the Arab Spring is proof of that. We should be careful not to make the same mistakes twice, and we must be capable of better responding to the political vacuum that a similar change could trigger in Central Asia, in a context of ethnic and regional conflicts. In Kazakhstan, trade unions in the oil sector have been on strike for more than six months despite merciless repression. Early legislative elections will be held on 15 January 2012, against a backdrop of unprecedented social tension and the banning of political parties. Will we have the courage and honesty to tell the Kazhak Government that the EU will draw the appropriate conclusions from these events during negotiations on future partnership and cooperation agreements? We are alarmed by the Human Rights Watch report published yesterday on the indescribably cruel torture that is carried out in Uzbekistan prisons. In Tashkent, human rights defenders have just been arrested. We were happy to hear Baroness Ashton, in Parliament, insisting that human rights should henceforth form the backbone of all of our external action. We therefore recommend carrying out a review of our strategy for Central Asia. I am especially proud of the fact that Parliament has put conditionality and the principles of differentiation and ‘more for more’ at the heart of its new approach, while recommending that we should enhance our support for civil society and independent media organisations. The EU cannot be honest in one part of the world while failing to respond to violations of its values in another. Lastly, we should consider regional cooperation. The challenges these countries are facing call for a concerted approach: ethnic conflicts, water resource management, security problems, circulation of arms and trafficking of drugs and people. These threats directly affect the security and stability of Central Asia, and also of Europe. We therefore recommend that the EU should play the role of mediator and facilitator. In order to promote dialogue between these countries, we recommend establishing an ad hoc
 parliamentary forum, which the EU, through the European Parliament delegation, could propose to the parliaments of the five Central Asian countries. MEPs would thus be able to share their experience and expertise while meeting with their counterparts. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continuation of the Israeli colonisation in Palestine has brought the peace talks to a standstill and has led the Palestinians to demand their accession to the UN, now that they have put in place credible political and economic institutions. Europe is dithering at a time when it should be adopting an independent position and asserting itself as a player on the international stage. According to a very recent poll, the majority of French, German and British citizens think that the Palestinians have the right to a State that should be recognised by the UN immediately. The fact is, we represent the citizens of Europe. The democratic awakening of the Arab world creates a new context which is likely to relaunch the peace process. The aspirations of young people are the same in Tunis, Cairo, Ramallah and Gaza. If we abandon the Palestinians, despair could lead to a new intifada, for which we would be responsible. It is in fact a historic opportunity that is being presented to the European Union. It should include the recognition of this Palestinian state in its policy of support for the Arab Spring, instead of exerting pressure on the Palestinian Authority to force it to abandon its claim to fully fledged statehood at the UN, and instead of working on the Israeli Government so that it finally agrees to respect international law.

 Mr President, I raised my blue card earlier on, but you did not see it. For I could have already asked Mr Provera the question I am asking Ms Ries, since they both used the same term –‘unilateral’ – several times. I would like them to explain what they mean by that and to also tell me how they define the building by Israel of hundreds of kilometres of wall and hundreds upon hundreds of houses in the settlements. I would like them to tell me how they can talk about unilateralism when we know that this initiative of recognising a Palestinian state is supported by 130 or 140 countries. I confess that I need the word to be defined for me. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance once again deplores the conditions under which Mr Rajoelina came to power in Madagascar. The political situation of that country, which is very unstable, is extremely worrying. There have been numerous human rights violations: violence against demonstrators, illegal arrests, arbitrary detentions, as well as abuses against journalists and political opponents. The security forces enjoy total impunity. Leaders of opposition political movements have been imprisoned. We are demanding their release. In addition, the uncontrolled management of the country’s natural resources threatens prospects for development for future generations and paves the way for an ecological disaster. We condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pillaging of precious wood, particularly rosewood. The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and foremost, the European Union.

 Mr President, these assassinations are, of course, intolerable, but what is more intolerable is the climate of impunity that exists, despite the increase in attacks. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors. Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws. The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally. According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system. The European Union must therefore use all the necessary instruments at its disposal to strengthen judicial cooperation with Pakistan. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have observed a strange tendency within the European Union: despite statements criticising Israel’s human rights violations, the Member States and the Commission are working tirelessly to strengthen political and economic relations with Israel, with no conditions attached. On 22 February, the Union actually upgraded its association agreement with Israel, promising to step up cooperation in several apparently technical agreements in various areas: competition, access to public contracts, Israel’s integration into the European Research Area and into European agencies such as Europol, the European Space Agency and so on. On 31 January, the Commission authorised the transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to Israel, a country suspected of having used EU citizens’ passports to carry out an extrajudicial killing in Dubai last year. Israel, which already participates in more than 800 projects with European universities and businesses, will receive more than EUR 500 million in subsidies in 2013. Among the beneficiaries will be the arms manufacturers Elbit and Israel Aerospace Industries, which manufacture the drones and aircraft used against the people of Gaza. At the Association Council, the European Union welcomed the new measures announced by Mr Netanyahu for Gaza and the West Bank. Baroness Ashton, please could you indicate what this facilitation measure consists of when hundreds of lorry drivers are protesting in Gaza as we speak to denounce the closure of the Karni crossing? Also, how does Mr Netanyahu propose to stop the rapid colonisation of Jerusalem and the West Bank? I would be grateful, Baroness Ashton, if you could send a message of encouragement and a true message of hope to all those women who took to the streets in Palestine yesterday and who are expecting a great deal of the European Union.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the massacres inflicted on the Coptic Christians in Alexandria provoked international outrage. The Eastern Christians’ situation as a whole is worrying: in Iraq, in Lebanon and even in Palestine, where Christians are leaving what they see as their Holy Land, worn down by the humiliation they have suffered under Israeli occupation. I am glad that our resolution on freedom of religion gives the subject a broad interpretation and recalls the fundamental rights: the right to believe and not to believe; the right to choose a religion without being discriminated against. Whilst our text quite rightly mentions the recent attacks and killings that have gone on in the world, we must also admit that in some European countries, respect for this freedom of religion is under threat. We often witness acts of intolerance: the profaning of Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic talk. Actions such as Switzerland’s vote to ban the construction of minarets and the rise of extremist parties who express intolerant views against certain communities are all signs that we must make the fight to uphold secular principles a priority in Europe. Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and ethnic and religious minorities are all facing a worrying increase in violations of their universal fundamental rights. Europe ought to set an example on tolerance and intercommunity dialogue. Eastern Christians are increasingly suspected of representing the interests and causes of the West, while Muslims in Europe are associated with radical Islam and terrorism. Let me read you if I may two lines of a poem by Louis Aragon: ‘Celui qui croyait au ciel, celui qui n'y croyait pas, et leur sang rouge ruisselle, même couleur, même éclat

 Madam President, Mrs Ashton, may I take this opportunity to thank Mr Arlacchi for the constructive atmosphere in which we have worked. This report offers a very honest, very fair analysis of the shortcomings in the international intervention in Afghanistan since 2001. We approve its key message: there will be no military solution. The war is having a huge cost. The war is costing human lives both amongst the soldiers and the population and it only serves to strengthen the Taliban. The only solution is a political one. What the Afghans are waiting for is real investment in their country’s development, in support for good governance, in the creation of a judicial system. The problem of fundamental rights, most importantly women’s rights, remains intact. The very recent report of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan demonstrates the inability of the Afghan Government to fully safeguard the rights of women and girls. I quote: ‘As long as women and girls are subject to practices that harm them, degrade them and deprive them of their rights, little significant or lasting progress can be made in Afghanistan’. In order to safeguard the rights of Afghan women, not only do we need written legal and constitutional guarantees, but more importantly their rapid and appropriate application. The National Assembly has little influence in the country, the bulk of the power being concentrated in the hands of President Karzai. If it is not too late, unfailing support, to strengthen democracy and the state of law, must come from the European Union to the various institutions and, in particular, to the parliament that has just been elected.

 Madam President, on 8 November, the Moroccan authorities used violence in dismantling the camp set up near Laâyoune, in Western Sahara, resulting in deaths and numerous injuries. I am absolutely outraged that a Member State, in this instance France, should object to the request for a UN fact-finding mission looking into these events. Uganda’s proposal at the UN Security Council meeting on 16 November was however both legitimate and desirable. It is all very well for France to hide behind the lack of decision on the part of the Security Council when it has abused its weight of veto power to prevent any light being shed on these incidents. Would the truth be so hard to face? Europe, which likes to think itself exemplary in protecting human rights, must demand an independent and transparent fact-finding mission, under the aegis of the United Nations, and an extended mandate for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). More generally, we are counting on Baroness Ashton for a fair and lasting solution to be brought to this unacceptable situation for the Sahrawi people. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, the Commission wrote in 2005 that, ‘individual expulsion decisions [taken by Member States’ competent authorities] have to comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention, the 1967 Protocol and international treaties. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The fact is, serious human rights violations do take place in Pakistan: the death penalty, torture, death while in custody, forced disappearances, honour crimes. As has already been said, there are several international agreements that it has not signed. How can we be sure that the rights of readmitted individuals and their safety will be protected? There are no guarantees for ethnic or religious minorities or for women. There is no mention of the consequences of the agreement for Afghan refugees, nor are there any plans for the implementation of the agreement to be monitored by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights. In the name of human rights and human dignity, Parliament must reject this agreement. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some people are saying that today’s debate is no longer topical. However, while pressure groups have been attacking European funding for Israeli NGOs since 2005, the working conditions of civil society in Israel continue to deteriorate. Since the publication of the Goldstone report, many representatives of organisations have been defamed, intimidated and arrested. Fourteen draft bills are currently under discussion. They all have the aim of restricting independence and freedom of association. I would remind you that Israeli defenders of human rights are no longer allowed to enter the occupied territories without a permit from the army. Israeli democrats and pacifists, who have been able to benefit from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, are concerned, because even in an amended form, this draft bill specifically targets the financing of international organisations while private funding is not affected. We will no longer accept that those people who have the courage to denounce the daily humiliations suffered by Palestinians, the expulsion of families, demolition of houses, land confiscation and water deprivation, should be reduced to silence. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
).

Mr President, I would simply like to ask Mrs Ries, since she does not think there has been any impact on the Knesset or on the Israeli authorities, to explain the communiqué from the Israeli Embassy which we were just talking about and to explain certain e-mails we have received over the past few days. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to start by paying tribute to the coalition of ecologists that we welcomed some months ago in Brussels, an association of Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians. It drew up some excellent reports on the situation in the region, on the state of the Jordan River, and on the risk of its disappearance. The European Union, which allocates substantial funds to development projects in the Middle East, must play more of a role in drafting and implementing a rescue plan for the river involving all parties in the region. The countries bordering the river, such as Syria, Jordan and Israel, divert the greatest part of it, while the Palestinians – as someone just said – receive only around 5% of the resource. In the Jordan Valley, the Israeli settlers consume six times more water than the Palestinians, particularly through the polluting intensive agriculture intended for the export of agricultural products to Europe. The extension of these settlements with their lush vegetation must stop, as must the destruction of Bedouin camps and their water tanks, which happened again this summer, some weeks ago. It is madness! The preservation and fair distribution of water in the region must be a priority for us. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, the case of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, which obviously brings us together this evening, and which has mobilised many citizens in Europe, should also provide us with an opportunity to discuss the situation of a number of women. I am thinking in particular of Zahra Bahrami, who is in the same situation. She is in danger of being executed following a trial that took place in similar conditions, that is to say, that she was subjected to pressure, isolation – total isolation – for several months, violence and torture in order to make confessions that subsequently, of course, are no longer recognised. The accusations are similar: waging war against God. She does not have access to either a lawyer or a defence counsel. There is also the case mentioned just now of the young man, Ebrahim Hamidi, a minor who also has no lawyer, and the case of Shiva Nazar Ahari, a journalist and human rights defender. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience, and she is currently locked up in a cage in which she cannot move her arms or legs. She is also threatened with death. I believe that it is to the credit of our Parliament that it is rallying in support of Mrs Mohammadi-Ashtiani’s case and of all these situations. We demand the abolition of the death penalty, a moratorium on all these executions, the immediate release of all those who have taken part in peaceful protests and, of course, the release of minors, because many minors are also sentenced to death in that country. We also urgently call for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit the prisoners. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Mrs Parvanova’s report on the social integration of women belonging to ethnic minority groups comes at just the right time, when the French Government is embarking on a huge operation to expel Roma men, women and children – the most disadvantaged and most discriminated-against citizens of Europe. Roma women are the victims of double discrimination because of their origin and their gender. They are discriminated against with regard to the exercise of the fundamental rights that are the right to education, to employment and to healthcare. The violence they suffer as women constitutes another form of discrimination. We must demand that all Member States respect the fundamental rights of the largest ethnic minority in Europe and, first and foremost, of these women. Forced labour, trafficking, forced sterilisation, child marriage and countless abortions characterise the lives of these women, and hounding them from town to town, moving them from one end of Europe to the other, will not improve their situation. It is the duty of every Member State, including France, to guarantee the protection of these women and to guarantee the education of Roma children, both boys and girls. This is the key to their freedom and to their independence. To be free and independent, they need stability and support; expulsions are unacceptable. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Madam President, freedom of religion is not guaranteed in Pakistan. In 2009, an increase in violent attacks against religious minorities has been observed, and that includes murders. In addition, nearly 80% of people from minority groups live below the poverty line. However, this is not the only problem with regard to the violation of human rights in Pakistan: other issues include a restriction on freedom of assembly, threats against civil society organisations, the arrest of trade unionists, kidnappings and the murder of journalists. Since Pakistan declared its support for the war against terrorism waged by the United States, hundreds, if not thousands, of people suspected of having links with terrorist groups have been arbitrarily detained: arrests without warrant, detentions with no legal basis or access to a lawyer, detentions in unspecified locations, forced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture. In the only prison in Lahore, 4 651 prisoners were held in 2009, while the prison has a capacity of only 1 050 prisoners. Violence against women continues to increase: rapes, suicides, acid attacks and women being burned. I would need not two minutes or two hours but two whole days to describe the ordeal suffered by young girls and women in Pakistan. It is within this context that this House, which is concerned about respect for women, freedom of conscience and human rights, is preparing to use its new power of veto for the conclusion of a readmission agreement between the European Union and Pakistan, thus demanding additional guarantees on the conditions for the implementation of such an agreement on the readmission of Pakistani nationals and Afghans who have transited through Pakistan.

Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would also like to echo the condolences that were just expressed by our fellow Members. We support wholeheartedly the resolution on the mass atrocities in Nigeria, which unfortunately represent only one aspect of the bleak human rights picture in that country. I would like, in the time I have been allotted, to speak about Nigeria’s prisons, which are full of prisoners whose rights are systematically violated. As a 2008 report by Amnesty International revealed, 65% of the prisoners in that country have never been found guilty of any crime. Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years. The problems are such that Nigeria has no choice but to recognise them and to promise to reform the system. We are still waiting for this reform. I am focusing my speech on the prisons because the current situation has once again reminded us of just how little value is put on the life of a human being in Nigeria, and even more so in the prisons. The National Economic Council of Nigeria has announced its plan to execute hundreds of death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in the prisons: killing to reduce prison overpopulation. There is nothing more shocking, especially when it is certain that many of these death-row inmates are innocent and the majority of them did not have the right to a fair trial, and particularly as in February 2009 the Nigerian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs declared before the UN that his country was applying a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. This is why, during the vote, I will table an oral amendment to denounce this recent move by several Nigerian governors. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as I indicated during the debate, I propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6: ‘Calls on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons, which would constitute a gross violation of human rights; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to Nigeria’s commitments at international level’.

Mr President, the resolution on Corporal Gilad Shalit, which we are examining today, supplements the many resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament on the human rights situation in the Middle East. Corporal Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage for 1 355 days, must be released as soon as possible. We demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released. The young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who has been detained by the Israeli authorities since 13 March 2005, must be released. The children imprisoned in Israel, in violation of the provisions of international law and the conventions on the rights of the child, must be released. The militants of the Non­Violent Popular Resistance Against the Occupation, such as Abdallah Abu Rahmah from Bil’in, must be released. The elected representatives, the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council – including Marwan Barghouti – must be released. It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East. The solutions do not lie in one­upmanship, exercised under repressive and violent conditions, an example of which was the assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai, which we condemn, not least because it makes securing the release of Gilad Shalit even more difficult.

 Mr President, the Roma issue is being keenly felt in my region, the west of France. In Nantes, over 1 000 Roma are being expelled from one place after another due to a lack of government regulated sites in which to accommodate them. The few municipalities with facilities to accommodate the Roma, for example, Rezé and Indre, located in the Nantes conurbation, are stretched to the limit and lack the support of the public authorities. The most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties. Responses cannot be local. They must be global. Inclusion of the Roma must be incorporated in every European Union policy in order to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these European citizens. I would also like to draw attention to the specific situation of the women. The problems faced by Roma women are particularly striking, for example, in relation to marital violence or unwanted pregnancies. In France then, according to Médecins du monde
, one in two Roma women, or 43% of that group, will have had an abortion by the age of 22. The average age for the first pregnancy is 17. Only 10% of Roma women use contraception. The European Union must therefore include the gender perspective in all studies and laws that concern the Roma. Education must be a major priority. We must act urgently with the Roma communities to make them aware of their fundamental rights and to facilitate their access to public services. I hope that, at the second European summit on Roma inclusion, the European Union will show its determination to deal with the Roma issue in a comprehensive fashion. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

 Mr President, our debate today is motivated by three aspects concerning the generalised system of tariff preferences. First, the current regulation expires on 31 December 2011. To allow the European Parliament to exercise the powers it possesses under the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission must give us a new draft regulation by June 2010 at the latest. Secondly, the way the Generalised System of Preferences+ (GSP+) operates is anything but perfect. Who decides the list of beneficiary countries and on the basis of which criteria? Amazing! Who actually monitors the implementation of the 27 international conventions on social and environmental issues that are a requirement for becoming a beneficiary of the GSP+? We do not know. What results has the GSP+ shown? Has it resulted in sustainable development, the diversification of production and the creation of respectable employment, or rather in the proliferation of short­term contracts, an increase in the number of abandoned farms and the concentration of large holdings dedicated to export? We have no idea. Therefore, a thorough reform of the regulation is required to guarantee democratic control and to ensure that the measures taken do indeed achieve the desired objectives. However, the real reason for the debate this evening is the regrettable case of Colombia. Until today, the Commission has refused to launch an investigation into the very serious human rights violations in that country. Such an investigation is, however, provided for in the regulation. It is inconceivable, given the values advocated by the European Union, that, in seeking profits in the dairy, automotive, pharmaceuticals, telecoms and banking sector for our own multinationals, the EU should abandon GSP conditionality and, in the past few days, rush into a free trade agreement with Colombia. This is a fatal blow to Colombia’s trade unions, small farmers and consumers and to its national industrial production. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, the London Conference on Afghanistan has led to panic sweeping through the heart of Afghan society, and women are particularly afraid. The peace plan agreed on by 70 countries includes a fund to help reintegrate the Taliban and a Loya Jirga – peace council – must take place within the coming months in order for this reconciliation to be put into effect. Women do not want to and must not pay the price for this reconciliation. The Taliban are still demanding the suppression of women’s rights and the return of Sharia. It is to be feared that the Loya Jirga will modify the Constitution and that the articles protecting women’s rights will disappear; in particular, Article 22 of Chapter 2. Today, 8 March 2010, I solemnly request that the European Union act as guarantor of the future of Afghanistan’s women, as the re-emergence of the most femicidal regime in history cannot be countenanced. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, in Israel, Judge Goldstone’s work is demonised and completely discredited in the eyes of the public. At the same time, a violent smear campaign is being conducted against human rights defenders, notably the New Israel Fund, a foundation which funds the main Israeli organisations for the defence of human rights and, in particular, against its president, Naomi Chazan, a former Member of the Knesset, an academic and intellectual known for her commitment to the defence of women’s rights and peace. Thirteen pacifist groups, such as Bethlehem and Breaking the Silence, are the victims of a veritable witch-hunt. The European Union must provide unfailing support to human rights defenders in all countries including, of course, Israel, whose impunity is an insult to democratic values. The European Union must protect Israel from its own demons. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen,

Back in 2006, the UN acknowledged that the most vulnerable populations and the poorest populations were the main victims of climate change. The fact is, women form the majority in both categories. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, although women are already discriminated against in terms of access to and control of land, the increasing scarcity of cultivable soil due to drought reduces their means of existence even further. A recent report forecasts that in 2050, a billion people will have fled from hostile environments. The loss of security of these climate migrants, forced to take refuge in makeshift camps, raises the level of threat against women. However, we have to admit that in the last 15 years, not one European legislative text on the environment has included the aspect of gender. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I therefore call on the European Union and its Member States to integrate the perspective of equality between women and men in all impact assessments, legislation and policies regarding the environment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is being threatened with strangulation. Subjected to a strict Israeli blockade since 2007, in 2009, Gaza’s population suffered the bloody attack that prompted the Goldstone Report, which was damning for the Israeli military authorities accused of war crimes. Today, it is the Egyptian authorities that have set about building an underground metal barrier in order to prevent any supplies getting through the tunnels. When will there be a stop to this collective punishment imposed on men, women and children, whose suffering is being manipulated on a political stage from a different era? The European Union must act. The European Union has all the trumps as Israel’s main economic partner and the principal contributor of aid to the Palestinian Territories. The Israeli Government will only accept a change of policy under pressure from the international community. The EU can play a decisive role in the resumption of the peace process and in the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state within the borders established in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Madam President, yes, we will have to emerge from the Afghan trap into which we fell because of the policy pursued by George Bush. However, the question is not when, but how, we pull out of Afghanistan. If the countless mistakes made by the international community are not called into question, we are in danger of completely losing the confidence and support of the Afghan population, for the benefit of the Taliban. The militarisation of humanitarian aid and development aid must stop because it is creating confusion in people’s minds and discrediting the NGOs. We must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the Afghan reformists. Why is Europe in Afghanistan? Because the United States said so, or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence? We need to strengthen the most effective Afghan structures, to prioritise investment in public services – education, health and transport – and to support good governance of local powers, since the culture of these countries requires us to reflect on the relevance of the nation state. Europe should, for instance, support Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan Province. Her appointment is a first in the history of this country where, you will recall, we went in 2001 to help the female population. Nicole Kiil-Nielsen  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the 2000s have been characterised in Europe by a proliferation of security laws: surveillance, repression, detention and imprisonment. Budgets linked to these policies have exploded. Yet violence against women is not in decline. It follows that, in 2008, 156 women died from injuries inflicted by their spouse in France, where almost one in ten women is a victim of marital violence. The security measures implemented for video surveillance, filing or biometrics do not meet the real security needs of women. This violence affects all women in all countries, whatever their origin, social background or religion. It is linked to discrimination based on gender. Sexism, just like racism, consists in denying another person an alter ego status. How do we combat sexism? What we require is strong political will to inform, prevent and protect, the political will to abolish all forms of discrimination in which violence takes root. Is not the safety of more than half of all European citizens, in other words female citizens, worth a substantial political investment? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have rightly spoken about tax evasion. You know that this struggle is extremely important for us, because it is a struggle that revolves around economic efficiency and social justice. Talking about these matters is all very well, but we would like to see action. Where are the Commission’s statements? Where is the pressure from the Commission to help Greece to try to recover the EUR 100 to 200 billion that are in Switzerland, according to the Greek Government’s estimates? I know that this is not necessarily Greece’s priority. Greece holds the primary responsibility for this inability to genuinely levy tax. All the same, where is the action by the Commission to exert pressure on Switzerland, so that the money can be taxed and then return to Greece? Just now, Daniel Cohn-Bendit was talking about what President Obama did in relation to the Swiss banks and banking secrecy. Where is the initiative by the European Commission to do exactly what Mr Obama did, namely, to impose an extra-territorial law that is binding and eliminates banking secrecy? Where is the Commission’s initiative to have a European list of tax havens? On the OECD’s blacklist, there is one state, or two states, or, from time to time, three states; they sign mutual conventions, and then there is no one left on the list. All of a sudden, the struggle is empty, because the blacklist is empty. Where is the Commission’s initiative? I want to see concrete answers, because it is all very well to make these grand declarations before Parliament, but it is actually much better to take tangible political action to put pressure on these states. I am fully aware that these states constitute the main obstacle to progress. We need you, however, to put pressure on the states. Mr Barroso, I would like to put a final question to you, not about tax havens, but about austerity. When we have informal discussions with your departments and those of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, this is what your officials tell us. When you put all the austerity policies and the requirements that have now been imposed by the Commission to reduce budget deficits into the same economic model, it is not possible to show that there is truly a path that will enable us to reduce the deficits. In fact, growth is being damaged to such a degree, and tax revenue is being decreased to such an extent, that the end result is a greater deficit, not a lower one. That is the case, for example, in Spain. The debate is also a live issue in the Netherlands, and perhaps soon will be in France too. Mr Barroso, the reality is that when you use these figures, it does not work. When are you going to admit this? When are you going to change direction? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Ms Kroes, in your speech on behalf of the Commission you said: ‘Eurobonds without fiscal consolidation will not work’. You are quite right. However, what we have today is fiscal consolidation without Eurobonds. What we are proposing here in Parliament is a balance between the two. The package you are proposing today is unbalanced. These are not our words. Listen to the rating agencies. When Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded France a few weeks ago, what it was saying was: ‘Austerity alone does not work’. You do not have to believe me, you do not have to believe the left here in the European Parliament, but you can believe the rating agencies, if you listen more closely to them. The challenge is to put in place today a roadmap because we do not underestimate the legal challenges and technical complexities. It is precisely because it is complicated, however, that we need to start immediately in order to send a message and prepare for the battle as quickly as possible. Over and above the technical and legal issues, there is also the political dimension. In Europe today do we want to do what the United States did 220 years ago, which was to pool, gradually, its public debt as a sign of solidarity and a reflection of a political will to create a political union? I believe that a majority of this House would wish to move in that direction. Surprise us in the European Commission! For once, be truly European and ambitious! Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, there are two democratic institutions in Europe: the Council, which represents the Heads of State or Government, who have been elected, and the European Parliament, which is elected by universal suffrage. For two years, the Council has had sole responsibility for resolving the crisis, and for two years, it has failed. It has failed every quarter by holding another last-chance summit. I will see you in another three months at the next last-chance summit, because last week’s summit completely failed to resolve the issues that were on the table. When you listen to the rating agencies – the infamous financial markets that you are keen to reassure – what do they say? They do not say, ‘more austerity, more discipline’. They say, ‘a comprehensive package including budgetary discipline’. No one is disputing the fact that we need to adopt this approach, but it is just one aspect of the package, not the only one. We are well aware that, today, with this package, with the outcome of this summit, you have added to the citizens’ concerns without even reassuring the markets. In other words, it is a complete waste of time. I shall see you again in three months’ time! However, there is a second European institution that is democratic, namely the European Parliament. As Mr Schulz, Mr Daul and Ms Harms said, it is our responsibility to recognise today that we need to take the lead in establishing an alternative crisis plan, one that offers a different approach from that of the Council, which is all about failure. It is our responsibility not just to vote on a resolution, but to use all the powers bestowed on us by the Treaties to their full extent, to shoulder our responsibilities and to be capable, between us, of reaching compromises. If we prove incapable of reaching compromises between us, then, at that point, we will no longer have the legitimacy to criticise others who are incapable of reaching them. However, we have three months to get there. We have a responsibility to do so; the people of Europe are watching us. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, the report we are voting on today concludes a year’s work and is the first time that the European Union will ban a financial product used to speculate on the debt of states. This report shows clearly that we have the political will to work together in this European Parliament and that we are capable of ensuring that our voices are heard, capable of negotiating, and capable of bringing the states round to our point of view. We in the European Parliament were the only ones to defend this idea of banning uncovered credit default swaps and types of speculation on sovereign debt – the Commission was against the idea – and, in the end, we have won the battle. I therefore urge you to vote in favour of this text. I am very pleased with it and I would like to thank very sincerely the European Parliament negotiators, especially Markus Ferber and Robert Goebbels, who helped me in these negotiations. (Applause) Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, in your speech you talked about peer pressure and market forces, but I think you forgot to mention people pressure because, when I look at the plan that you adopted yesterday evening, I see that you are applying the same approach to Italy as you are to Greece. This is an unpleasant approach and it does not work. If you want to increase the problems we already have in Greece by applying the same approach to Italy tomorrow, please feel free to do so, but I am sure that people pressure will change the landscape. You have not mentioned the word ‘tax’ at all. Several MEPs have mentioned in this House that tax evasion was a major problem in Europe. Our region has the greatest fiscal competition in the world. We are a single market but we do not have fiscal harmonisation. We simply must resolve this paradoxical situation. You know the figures. In Italy, according to the government, EUR 120 billion escape the Italian tax system, EUR 200 billion in Greece, EUR 100 billion in France and EUR 150 billion in Germany. There is no point in calling on casual workers, the unemployed, junior civil servants and the retired to make a contribution if you do not make it a priority to tackle tax evasion. You have not said a single word about this. This is an outrageous and unjust shortcoming in the outcome of yesterday’s summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, President Barroso, I would like to ask you a question. If it is no trouble to you, would you mind listening to it? I am not going to make a long speech. My question is a specific one: do you know how much Greek money – according to the Greek Government itself – is deposited in Switzerland and escaping Greek taxation? EUR 200 billion, which is the equivalent of Greece’s annual GDP and of two-thirds of Greece’s debt. I am still waiting for your initiative to impose taxation on this money which has escaped the Greek tax system. I am also waiting for a strong initiative on this matter from Greece’s socialist government. It would have no macroeconomic impact on Greece, since this money has already gone elsewhere, but this policy would be completely legitimate from a social point of view. However, in order to take this initiative, the Greek Government needs the EU. You will argue that this is complicated, but there is a very simple example: the United States, which is fighting a daily battle to have Swiss banking secrecy lifted for its own citizens and which is winning that battle. Meanwhile, we are either doing nothing, or doing things in an utterly disorganised and counterproductive manner, as the UK and Germany have just done by signing an agreement with Switzerland limiting the EU’s scope for action. It is up to you to take an initiative: EUR 200 billion is a very large sum. We cannot ask European taxpayers to show solidarity if rich Greek citizens do not show any either. Pascal Canfin

 Mr President, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, Mr Rehn, you have focused your comments in this debate on economic governance, that is to say, on the package of six directives that are currently being negotiated. The specific purpose of this report is to integrate this work but, also, to go beyond it. It also aims to indicate a path, a vision that goes beyond the very short-term discussions in which you are rightly involved. However, do take the time to read this report because it outlines a majority view. It is not just the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is a vision that results from a compromise, a compromise reached by a majority. Examining its contents provides a breath of fresh air with regard to the current situation. What is the issue at stake today? The issue is working out who will be paying for the crisis, who will be paying for these 20 percentage points of public debt, accumulated over three years, to save the markets, the banks, and Europe from a very significant recession. By continuing to focus on the issue of public finances, you are targeting the fire-fighter rather than the arsonist. If the Member States have spent 20 points of their Gross Domestic Product in additional debt, it was not for the pleasure of doing so, but because they had no other choice. In solely considering the consequences and limiting yourselves to a European policy focusing on managing the consequences of this crisis, and not the causes, I think you are missing the point and you are causing pro-European opinion among Europeans to become significantly weaker. We know that today, we are threatened by this trend and this isolationism. The second major issue which this report seeks to address concerns the balance of power between the Member States and the markets. We created the euro, in part, to prevent the markets from speculating on our currencies. That is what we saw in the 1990s. Currently, we are at the point at which we must prevent the markets from speculating on our public debts and, in order to do so, we have two tools available to us. The first is Eurobonds, which would involve mutualising our debt to ensure a deep liquid market, such that it is no longer possible to speculate against the single public debt market. The function of the second tool is to limit the capacity of the financial markets to speculate on public debt through a number of instruments. This is the path that a majority in Parliament is ready to propose to you. Seize this opportunity, President-in-Office, on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission.

Mr President, I wanted to propose submitting the report on the legislative proposal to the scrutiny of this House, for the same reasons that we did so regarding the report on derivatives. We have already had four negotiation meetings with the Council. We are now sending a very strong political message, but we are not voting at first reading in order that we can continue the discussions and negotiations in a very practical manner starting next week or in September. I would therefore like to request a report concerning the vote on the legislative proposal. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the positive atmosphere he has created in the debates we have been able to have. They have resulted in an ambitious and responsible text on which there is very broad agreement in Parliament. I would also like to emphasise two points on which we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, presented proposals, and which were subsequently taken up by all the political groups that supported this text. The first point concerns harmonisation by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the rules on collateral-related competition between clearing houses. We know that one of the great dangers of this text is that risks will be concentrated in clearing houses when they were previously spread around. They will be concentrated in clearing houses, which actually compete with each other by reducing the level of security within the system. No provision was made in the initial Commission proposal to prevent clearing houses competing on the level of security, an important criterion of which is the level of collateral. The second point that I wished to emphasise is our proposal to expand Parliament’s text; we have removed the threshold set by the Commission which limited the transmission of information – the reporting of trading information – because not all derivatives will be traded in clearing houses. We have therefore made provision for all information, be it on over-the-counter trading or on trading carried out in clearing houses, to be transmitted to the regulator so that he has an overview of the risks that exist. I hope that the Council will be receptive to this important development of Parliament’s text. Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this report concerns short selling and the supervision of credit default swaps, those products that insure debt against default, in particular state default. The origins of this text lie in the Greek crisis, which began in spring 2010. Following certain movements on the financial markets that had been observed, a political request was put to Commissioner Barnier and to the European Commission to establish European rules on short selling and on sovereign debt speculation tools. The Commission drafted that regulation in September. This was followed by the adoption of our position in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March, and of the Council position in May. Since then we have been negotiating, because we have already had five trialogues, which have enabled us to reach a number of possible compromises. Although they are not here, I should like to thank the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who took part in these trialogues and helped to move this matter forward. However, after those four or five negotiating sessions, we and the shadow rapporteurs who voted by a majority for this text in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in other words, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which I represent – took the decision to vote in the July part-session for this text, but not for the legislative proposal, in order to send two messages. The first message consists in saying that we want to carry on negotiating with the Council because it has been almost a year since the Commission tabled this text and because, on this issue as on others, Parliament wishes to adopt a responsible yet ambitious attitude. We want these texts; we want the rules on financial markets to change. Too often, we have to wait for the Council, which clearly takes much longer to make its decisions than we do. Therefore, we want to carry on negotiating, which means that we will not be voting for the legislative proposal tomorrow. However, we also want to send three messages on the substance in order to reaffirm the positions adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which will become the positions of the European Parliament too when it adopts them – by a very large majority, I think – tomorrow. The first issue concerns the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). In our version we have strengthened the role of ESMA, and you have reminded us many times, Commissioner, of the importance of that institution when it comes to ensuring the consistency of the single-market rules on financial services. I have to say that the position adopted in the Council – to have a red line that is an absolute red line for us, to create a right of veto for States on European regulatory issues concerning sovereign debt – is completely unacceptable. The second point that I wished to raise is that we in Parliament want a simple rule: when you sell an asset, be it a share or a bond, you must be able to know for certain where to find it; there must be an agreement with the person who is going to lend it to you. This is what is known as the ‘hard locate’ rule in technical speak. This is Parliament’s position, and I think it is a sensible one. The final point that I should like to emphasise, and which is obviously a key element of the discussions we are having, is the ban on naked credit default swaps. This position is shared by a large majority of the European Parliament. We do not see how it is possible, in financial terms, to cover oneself against a risk with a credit default swap without being liable for that risk, in other words without owning the bond of the country that issued the security. It is a nonsense and it opens the door to speculation. To conclude, I would say that the current debates on Greece prove us right, because some of the arguments made to limit the Greek restructuring consist in saying, ‘Yes, but some people have speculated. If the debt is restructured, they are going to make money without having invested in Greece.’ That is exactly what we want to put a stop to. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,  
rapporteur. 
− (FR)
 Mr President, I just wanted to say something to my fellow Member, Mr Kamall − since he is one of the negotiators of this text and is very familiar with it, and if he is not, he only has to read it – concerning his argument that credit default swaps (CDSs) are used as proxy hedges and therefore should not be banned. As the text says, when CDSs are used for proxy hedging, they are not uncovered. It would be helpful, therefore, if you could change your argument or read the text, because we are debating for nothing otherwise. (Applause)
 The second point that I wished to make is that we really want to complete this text because we feel that the situation is urgent. No one is saying that CDSs caused the Greek crisis. It would be absurd to think that. However, they are clearly being used to fan the flames by financial operators whose sole aim is to exacerbate the crisis so that they can make money at some point. While we are on the subject of CDSs, I should like to tell you that this text only covers the purchase of these swaps. This presents another problem, which was also raised by Mr Kamall, concerning the fact that operators who sell CDSs, such as US banks and hedge funds, are supposed to provide a guarantee against the risk of default to banks such as BNP, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. For those banks, it is a way of getting the risk off their balance sheets. However, those who sell CDSs, such as hedge funds, have a lot less capital than the banks. This tool has the effect of reducing capital requirements and hence the security of the system. Since you are working on the Capital Requirements Directive 4, I should like it if you could also cover the sale of CDSs and the obligations incumbent on sellers of CDSs, rather than just focusing on buyers, as is the case in this text. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, as you know, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is traditionally very attached to the EIB. We believe that it is an extremely important public policy instrument, and it is because we are very attached to it that we are also very demanding of it – the two go hand in hand. Our view of the EIB is that, ultimately, it is a bank in its own right, and as such, it is subject to bank constraints, which must be taken into account. Several of my fellow Members rightly referred to the fact that the EIB ought perhaps to take account of new constraints linked to the banking sector. At the same time, it is a truly exceptional bank, because it is indeed funded by taxpayers’ money. It is also there to do what the others are not doing, and to adopt rules that go beyond what the private sector can do. I should like to stress one or two points on which I feel that the EIB could do even better, even though progress has been made in recent months. The first point concerns the issue of tax havens. This is an extremely important fight not only for us, but also, I think, for a very large majority of my fellow Members in this House. The crisis showed that tax havens obscure, undermine and weaken the entire financial system and the world economy. Therefore, in this report, the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens. I believe that that practice should be stopped. I am well aware that you have operational constraints on the ground, but there is a political point here, which is that, if you are the power behind Europe, you have to fight battles. If you fight battles, then I think that the battle against tax havens should be one of them. As for us, we would obviously like to go further; in other words, we would like you to attach conditions to EIB loans to businesses that are not part of the entire value chain in tax havens and which are, at the very least, on the OECD’s blacklist, which is currently being revised. The second point that we wished to raise concerns the issue of monitoring and governance. Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now. I believe that we should extend the choice, that we should increase the level of joint accountability so that the choice of projects involving taxpayers’ money is made as democratically and as transparently as possible. The third point is about measuring the benefits of your action. You measure them in financial terms too, of course. As I was saying earlier, you are a bank in your own right, which means that you have challenges to meet in terms of the risk/reward ratio. However, you aim to provide other benefits too, and that is why public money is used. You aim to provide benefits in terms of social cohesion, in terms of the fight against poverty, in terms of environmental protection. I think that you could make still more progress in reporting, in measuring these non-financial benefits, which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy. I think that, rather than setting the financial benefits against the non-financial benefits, you should carry out as broad an assessment as possible, and not limit it to monetary and financial issues alone. Lastly, the final point of my speech will relate to climate change. The report specifically states that you must pursue all the EU’s objectives. One of the official objectives of the European Union is to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue to finance coal-fired power plants, which have a 40-year life span and which emit huge amounts of CO2

 – (FR) 
I have a very simple answer to that. I believe that the EIB has cost UK taxpayers a lot less than other, completely private UK banks have cost them, and I believe that the general interest, just like that of UK taxpayers, is far better served by the EIB than by other UK banks that the taxpayer has had to bail out. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think that many of my fellow Members will have remembered that the background to this package for the Single Market comes from the Monti report, and the Monti report recommended a considerable compromise between those who advocate more competition, if you like, and those who advocate giving more weight to social, environmental and tax-related aspects. I believe that, here in Parliament – and as long as the texts are not unpicked in the votes we shall be having in plenary in a few hours – we have succeeded in finding this compromise, including in the 14 proposals that emerge from the three reports as a whole. I also know that you are having discussions, in the College of Commissioners, to determine which central themes you will be retaining, and we shall clearly be paying great attention to whether this balance found within Parliament and desired by Mr Monti is taken up and extended to the 12 central project themes to which you have referred. I would like to highlight three items which seem particularly important to me, further to what Mrs Turunen said a little while ago on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The first aspect concerns competition. The issue of the Single Market is to ascertain where we can focus competition. Do we focus competition on innovation, on products or do we focus competition on the rules, through environmental dumping or social dumping? I believe we have indeed struck a balance here in Parliament – and I hope you can carry it over into the Commission – which is to say ‘yes’ to more competition through innovation, ‘yes’ to more capital investment, but ‘yes’ also to a social clause, ‘yes’ to environmental standards that ensure that competition does not lead to regulatory dumping. Those are the two aspects that I believe are fundamental to our compromise. The second item that I would like to highlight concerns the tax-related aspects. When you proposed the consolidated corporate tax base for multinational companies in your first version of the Single Market Act, it was not an optional proposal: in other words, all companies had to be subject to this consolidated tax base. In the proposal put out by the Commission 10 days or so ago, it is an optional measure: in other words, instead of building up an aspect of the Single Market, the Commission is tearing one down. You will be adding a new system, you will be adding a layer of complexity, you will be adding regulatory arbitrage instead of creating tax harmonisation. The proposal tabled by the Commission a fortnight ago runs totally counter to what we in Parliament want and to what you had proposed. The last point I want to highlight very quickly is the notion of reciprocity, in exactly the same terms as you have done. The Single Market accounts for 500 million people; it is an economic entity, but it is also a political entity which must afford us more influence in shaping globalisation. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, I wanted to clarify why we voted in favour of this Single Market Act. I think it is a step forward. Parliament managed to find the right compromises that do not flush the text of its content but, instead, put real pressure on those who, in the Commission, want the Single Market to continue to adopt a purely free market approach, without including social issues, tax issues or environmental issues. I also merely wanted to clarify that paragraph 54, which deals with public services, services of general interest, is problematic, and we therefore voted against part of this paragraph, which continues to call, ideologically but in veiled terms, for further liberalisation. We argue instead in favour of European public services and securing the European framework, leaving each Member State the option to continue organising public services as they wish, especially at territorial level. Pascal Canfin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission, and the European Union in particular, to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned. As you know, Brussels is the international lobbying capital, before Washington. There are more lobbyists in Brussels than in Washington, and one of the ways in which they exert their influence on the Commission is through these famous expert groups. I am a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You have, for example, a group of banking experts. Ninety-five per cent of the members of that expert group are bankers, and not just any bankers: only bankers from finance and investment banks, money market banks, and all the major US banks – J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – are represented in it. On the other hand, there are no NGOs or trade unions in that expert group. The idea that the Commission should be advised only by investment bankers, and US investment bankers at that, with regard to changing banking rules seems totally surreal to me after the financial crisis we have gone through. Hence there are some very precise questions and some very precise points in this oral question being put to you: are you going to change the composition of these expert groups? Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided? In the European Parliament, in fact, this is a completely transpartisan issue. There are left-wing MEPs, right-wing MEPs, Green MEPs and liberals who are very interested in these issues. Why were we not involved earlier in the reforms that you have introduced? Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, in 2006, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the Services Directive, and today, we consider the report assessing the implementation of this Services Directive, previously known as the Bolkestein Directive, to be equally unsatisfactory. The Verts/ALE Group will therefore vote against this report. I should like to make it clear, Mrs Gebhardt, that you did everything you could to achieve the best possible compromises. However, I believe that some red lines have unfortunately been crossed in this report, which means that we cannot vote in favour of it. I should also like to state that you took great care to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I certainly do not wish to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union, either. If France, for example, transposed the Services Directive and chose to include day nurseries in it, when almost all of the other countries chose to do the opposite, it is clearly the responsibility of the French Government and not of the European Union. Therefore, the Verts/ALE Group is certainly not voting against this report in order to criticise the way in which the directive has been transposed in France. It is doing so on account of two key points. The first is that we asked time and again, during the discussions, for the Member States to assess the impact that the initial transposition of the Services Directive had on the quality of jobs and services. Unfortunately, that assessment of the impact on job and service quality could not be integrated into the report. We also called for an assessment of the cost impact for public authorities. Every time we try to take steps to regulate the financial markets, for example, we are told that it will cost a fortune. Here, we have a very high cost for public authorities at a time when budgets are tight, and no one wants to assess it in order to weigh up the pros and cons of the Services Directive. My final point is in the form of a question to Commissioner Barnier. Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain an assurance in this report that the European Commission will finally take note of Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and present a proposal for a directive on public services. Can you tell us when the Commission will finally face up to its responsibilities on this point? Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn, I genuinely hope that you will look at the work done by the European Parliament on the subjects we have been dealing with today – the Berès report and the Feio report – because, of course, we are now working as colegislators on economic governance. I can tell you that together with four pro-European groups in Parliament at least, we have made a genuine effort to work on compromises that will achieve something. We have just come from the discussions to try to tie up the problems. Some people are talking about the budget, some are talking about tax measures, and some are talking about governance. What we need today is for the Commission – and it is your role to do this, we are trying to do it and it is your role to do it also – to propose an overall package: something in the spirit of the Monti report that is also along the lines of what Michel Barnier has been trying to do in the context of the internal market. I am waiting for an overall package from Mr Barroso, which should show us how to get ourselves out of the economic crisis. It should not just be about macro-economic governance, but should be along the lines of reading three or four dossiers on macro-economics, tax and the budget and then saying ‘here is the package’. I am sure that if you do that, you will have a very large majority in the European Parliament to support the initiative. If we only look at the issue of public finance, for example, two or three years ago, the Commission and its departments were themselves saying that, of all the countries, Spain was sticking to the Stability and Growth Pact most closely and that Spain’s public finances were in order. The problem is that the instability came from elsewhere and now Spain is in a terrible situation, as is Ireland. We can clearly see that focusing on public finances alone will not help us resolve the crisis. The compromises that we have proposed in the various reports that have been presented today, which will be voted on tomorrow, represent the sum of these issues. They are a way of saying that, yes, we do need to strengthen budgetary discipline. Of course we do. However, to ensure that this budgetary discipline does not lead to social breakdown, but only to public expenditure cuts, we need, at the same time, a European budget package that will finance investment and a tax package that will allow Member States to impose certain taxes. My last question for Mr Rehn, and for Mr Barroso especially, is therefore: are you genuinely in favour of the common corporate tax basis? Do you genuinely support it? It has been shelved by the Commission for 10 years now and for 10 years, you have failed to deal with the matter. It is now time that you did so. (Applause) Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted. It is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors. I must say that the ability to strictly limit the variable remuneration of directors of banks assisted by the public purse, and even the possibility to defer up to 70% of traders’ bonuses in the long-term interests of the bank and, potentially therefore, to take account of the risks taken and the negative effects of these risks in order to reduce these bonuses, are important rules which translate the G20’s commitments in principle into real figures at European level. However, I must also say that in negotiations with all the other shadow rapporteurs and with the rapporteur herself, we constantly came up against a lack of commitment by the States, against the huge gap between fine rhetoric on the regulation of capitalism, on the raising of the moral standards of capitalism, on the one hand, and the negotiating positions of the Council and the main States, which constantly refused to agree figures, and tried to reduce the scope of and water down all of our ambitious proposals, on the other. I must say, Commissioner, that the Commission has largely been on our side in this struggle. Therefore, I think that this is an achievement which we can share. Now, there is an important issue at stake. As we lost, we have had to make compromises. We lost a number of battles aimed at agreeing figures, and we have had to replace these figures with a number of words, often rather portmanteau words, such as ‘justified’, ‘appropriate’ and ‘balanced’. The challenge now is for the future European banking authority to translate these principles and portmanteau words into real figures, which will then be applied by all banks and all Member States. I would therefore like to know, Mr Barnier, how you intend to apply pressure on and strictly monitor this future process so that it does not distort the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr Rehn, as you know, there are two ways to reduce deficits. Expenditure can be cut or taxes can be increased. All States can cut expenditure at the same time, although separately, without needing any European coordination. However, to increase taxes and, more specifically, taxes on capital, companies, profits and banks, they do need European coordination. Your communication last week contained absolutely no mention at all of this issue. My question, which is a fairly common one among Members from all groups, is as follows: over the course of the next few weeks, are you going to propose a tax coordination plan to provide Member States with the means of recovering margins for manoeuvre so that they can increase certain taxes, which is something they are unable to do separately? This is the added value which the European Commission can provide at the present time. Unfortunately, you do not have any plans in this area. Mr Verhofstadt was saying that you had a right to take the initiative. In the current situation, you have a duty to take the initiative in this area. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Barnier, in your speech you mentioned Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted to you a few days ago. There is a very interesting aspect in Mr Monti’s report, and that is the emphasis it places on the pressing need for us to move on to the next stage of fiscal cooperation. It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied, but that if they are applied solely to expenditure, through cuts in expenditure, this will almost certainly lead to a recession. It is therefore crucial to use both pillars and, in particular, the fiscal pillar, to enable the Member States to collect a number of additional receipts from the economic activities and economic operators whose tax burden has been repeatedly reduced over the last few years: the profits from companies, capital, and financial transactions. To do this, we absolutely must have European coordination. This is the conclusion reached in Mr Monti’s report, which was submitted two days ago. However, there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission. There is no mention whatsoever of this issue in Mr Rehn’s communication published a few days ago. This is one of the major pillars, one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time. Do this, and this will establish the link – Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy, the report on the governance of the euro area, on the single market, and employment and education issues. We are well aware that, if we abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact – which, incidentally, is vital – but do so only by cutting expenditure, then we are on course for social regression and economic recession. Therefore, my question is very clear: Mr Barnier, as a representative of the Commission, what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks? How are you going to convince your colleagues – assuming that you are already convinced yourself – of the need for an action plan, for a fiscal coordination plan so that Member States are able once more to raise new revenues on the basis of a number of agreements? What are your proposals? You are not entitled to stay silent. The Commission has a right to initiate legislation, but, today, on these issues, that right has become a duty. Pascal Canfin,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, our public finances are in a situation of crisis and we know that part of the solution may lie in reducing some spending, but that a large part of the solution is in Member States’ ability to raise more funds. The issue at stake, therefore, is knowing what type of tax may be increased, what type of tax must be increased, and what the consequences of these tax increases will be. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance estimates that it would be difficult to significantly raise the taxes paid by small businesses, which create the majority of jobs. It is difficult to increase the taxes paid by families – with the possible exception of those paid by the richest – because in the majority of cases, these are already high enough, particularly in Europe. The question, therefore, is: which taxes should be increased? If taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises are not increased and nor is VAT, other possibilities will inevitably have to be sought. We estimate that a tax on financial transactions is, in the end, the least painful tax for the European economy. It is the tax with the least negative consequences for the global competitiveness of the European economy. Moreover, the cost of financial transactions has diminished enormously over the last ten years or so, both because of a certain number of technical improvements – if they can be called that – and because of European regulation. In fact, these reductions in costs have been entirely absorbed by the financial industry and the banks. It would not be totally unjustified if, by means of a tax on financial transactions, part of the profit saved by the banks from these decreased costs made its way back to the public authorities that saved them. As is always the case, this House is turning this into a very ideological debate, but it is actually quite technical. Transaction costs existed before; they have been reduced. Today, we are proposing that they be increased again in order for public authorities to benefit from these technical improvements and not just private actors. Naturally, the issue of whether the European Union can take this step forward on its own is being raised. It is clear to everyone that it would be better if this were done within an international framework. If others – specifically, the United States – do not follow our lead, the following question arises: is the European Union’s prospect of achieving this then ruled out? Some statements – for example, that of Mr Gauzès – suggest that the Group of the European People’s Party believes that Europe can do nothing on its own. That situation would not, of course, be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent. Does that, however, mean that the European Union should necessarily position itself at the lowest common denominator, that it should have the least possible regulation, and align itself with the least ambitious actor? That does not seem to us to be the sort of thing that will strengthen the European Union’s position of leadership in the world. Furthermore, it is possible to imagine the European Union putting this transaction in place on its own. This is quite simply because the capital flows that concern us start out in the European Union, then may move elsewhere, only to return to the European Union. When these flows leave and return, we have the opportunity to demand that they can be traced, and to know whether or not they have been subject to this tax on financial transactions. If they have, no problem. If they have not, then we can deduct an entry or exit tax. We have done so for years in the real economy with the Common External Tariff. Financial globalisation is now obliging us to do so in the financial sphere of the economy, and it is entirely possible from a technical point of view. What is needed is the political will.

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to tell the Spanish Presidency that we fully support its analysis of the political will to progress towards new tools of governance and towards an economic union, and not just a monetary union, as Mr Bullmann also pointed out. You will have our political group’s full support in this undertaking. In actual fact, leaving aside the Greek case, which is at stake, I believe that we need to review all the tools of economic governance of the euro area and, in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact. More than half of the Member States in the euro area no longer adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, let us not forget that, until fairly recently – until the crisis – Spain was fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, but that did not stop it, two years later, from finding itself in a radically different situation, with a 20% unemployment rate, or from completely disregarding those criteria. What does this mean? It means that, with a Stability and Growth Pact that is narrowly focused on public finance criteria, which are absolutely necessary but insufficient, until recently, Spain controlled its public debt and its public deficit but, at the same time, allowed its private debt to soar. There has been an explosion in private debt, a speculative bubble on the property market, and a recession on a much greater scale than elsewhere, with the result that a massive injection of public money is required. This is indeed proof that, by having a blinkered view of the Stability and Growth Pact and a view of euro area governance that is focused solely on public debt, one fails to see the bigger picture, which would make it possible to anticipate the next crisis and to prevent it. I should therefore like to know what proposals both the Spanish Presidency and the Commission have put on the table in order, of course, to reaffirm the Stability and Growth Pact and, above all, to integrate it into a more comprehensive system. Secondly, you say – and you are right – that public finances need to be controlled better, that a return to more stable debt levels is necessary. In your view, does that depend solely on a decrease in public spending, or does it also depend on the ability to increase certain taxes? If so, which ones? Also, what role can fiscal cooperation between ourselves play in enabling the Member States to regain some room for manoeuvre that will allow them to make up their deficits, not only by reducing expenditure, but also by regaining some room for manoeuvre so as to increase their revenues? Pascal Canfin,

Madam President, in her speech, Mrs Malmström said that action was needed, not just fine words. I can tell you that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will follow the results of this summit between the United States and the European Union very closely, since it comes at a key moment in the path leading us, on the one hand, to Copenhagen and, on the other, to the reform of the international financial system. On this last point, the casino has now reopened, banks’ profits are once again reaching historic levels – USD 437 billion in profits for the US banks – and our view is that there is less political will than there was six months ago. We therefore have enormous expectations of this summit, which is intended to show that, in both the US and Europe, the political will to regulate capitalism and to regulate the financial institutions is still present. In order to achieve this, we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points. The first is combating tax havens, and this is something that was not mentioned in your speeches. The US Treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of USD 100 billion. We therefore wanted to emphasise this point and to tell you that it is important for the United States and Europe to work jointly on this issue at the summit. The second point, which has just been mentioned, is the tax on financial transactions. When Mr Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency, he expressly said that he was in favour of such a tax. A fortnight ago, the European Parliament for the first time voted, by a majority, for a tax on financial transactions, provided that they formed part of an international framework. The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States/European Union Summit in early November. My last point is that on climate, we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr Obama’s foot. President Obama wants to act, but he is blocked by his majority. The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking, at the end of October, to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30% reduction in its own emissions. Once this is done, we will be able to make progress in negotiations. This is our responsibility. We must do it before the summit. Pascal Canfin  (Verts/ALE

− The Verts/ALE Group voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 for several reasons, among which: – by referring to the need to develop new indicators which go beyond GDP, the EP gives a clear signal that ‘economic recovery’ must not be based on a ‘business as usual approach’, which is in line with our request to develop a ‘Green New Deal’; – the resolution insists on the need to tackle global imbalances, especially exchange rate imbalances and commodity price volatility within a multilateral framework; – the resolution sends a good signal towards the setting-up of a tax on financial transactions, which was never the case until now; – as regards the financial crisis, the EP makes a strong statement on international coordination that should aim to avoid regulatory arbitrage. It also stresses that the upgrading of prudential rules within the context of the G20 consists of a ‘minimum harmonisation’ approach that must not prevent the EU from applying higher standards; – as regards supervision of the financial sectors, the EP has made a significant move towards an enhanced and more centralised approach on financial market supervision, with the setting up of a single financial supervisory authority being a final objective.

Mr President, you spoke of the governance of the IMF. I would also like to know if you intend to raise the issue, at the G20, of the conditionality of the money that the IMF lends to states. We have seen that what were previously very liberal conditions have not been changed, and this applies in particular to the loans that were granted to some European States. What is your position on this? My second question is: what is the position of the Commission and the Council on the Chinese proposal to put in place a slightly different international currency, in an effort to regulate the financial system using an alternative to the dollar? My third question is: the G20 is also part of the preparations for Copenhagen. The Commission has proposed a total sum of between EUR 2 and 15 billion to help the countries of the South adapt to climate change. What is the Council’s position? What sum will you put on the table at the G20 next week? Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I have a question for my colleagues about the Polish demand, because I get the impression that this debate is becoming nationalised and that by authorising shale gas exploitation in Poland we are trying to give it European legitimacy. As regards potential, what do you have to say about the figures and the potential that were announced and then the subsequent discovery that there is seven times less potential for exploiting and exploring shale gas in Poland? What do you have to say about subsidiarity, seeing as you are invoking the principle? Does Poland intend to apply subsidiarity to environmental regulations? As it stands today, this falls under European jurisdiction and no country may decide not to apply the regulations. Finally, on the question of acceptance, what answer would you give to the European public, especially those who have lodged complaints with the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions?

 Mr President, My question is very short and simple. There was no answer just before about the expert reports on the exploration and exploitation of shale gas causing micro earthquakes – we have studies from Great Britain and the United States. What is your answer to that in terms of energy choice and the impact of shale gas exploitation and exploration on ground stability? Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go on creating Europe without its citizens. The year 2013 will be the European Year of Citizens. This is good news. There is a lot at stake here, and we shall have to give ourselves the resources to enable us, in the difficult situation which the European Union is experiencing, faced with disaffection and lack of confidence, to turn the European Year of Citizens into Year One of European citizenship in everyday life. Our citizens are the reason for our presence here, and we must send them the message that Parliament and the European Union do not take citizens’ rights lightly, that they are at the heart of all the decisions that we take on a day-to-day basis. We need a campaign which matches the level of what is at stake. Savings in the budget must not be made on this aspect if we do not want the gulf between the Union and its citizens to become even wider. The action programme will have to be ambitious. The tools of participative democracy must be developed and distributed: petitions, access to the Ombudsman, European citizens’ initiatives, citizens’ forums, consultations, etc. I am sorry to say that our citizens fail to appreciate the rights and tools of participative democracy. In 2013, let us put our citizens back into the heart of our institutions and, in so doing, put Europe back into the heart of its Member States. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just got back from Hyderabad, in India, and the Eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity. Parliament was represented there alongside the Commission and the Council. The task facing this summit was an important one: to decide on financing for the biodiversity rescue plan 2010-2020 [sic
: 2011-2020], adopted two years ago at Nagoya. It was a close-run thing; the talks were difficult, but definite progress was made on maritime and coastal waters, and a commitment was secured to double the funding for biodiversity by 2015. After the disappointment of the Rio Summit, this comes as a relief. The European Union and the international community are still capable of imposing their will when it comes to the environment. But the critical state of biodiversity requires us to intensify our efforts and deliver on our commitments to preserve our natural world, here and now, in the budget, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. And soon we shall be debating measures against biopiracy and ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. I urge you to show a solid front and prove, once again, that the European Parliament seeks and feels a responsibility for biojustice at European and world level. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to say how delighted I am that we are having this discussion in this House just a few days after the Earth summit, which, as we have already heard, a number of you attended. It is time, I believe, to take stock and, most of all, to look forward. Taking stock is a simple matter: the results of this summit are disappointing. Forty years after the first Earth summit and 20 years after the commitments made in Rio, while we were expecting renewed impetus, a leap forward, the leaders of the international community were treading water. As to the future we want, the promise has not been kept and the commitments have been carried forward to 2015. The European Union set off for Rio with the ambition of sharing an action programme and we are returning with a work programme. Today, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Potočnik in particular, as well as the Member States, for the determination they have shown in the negotiations, and for embodying Europe’s ambitions in terms of the ecological transition of our economy, which we defined in this Parliament. Where do we go from here? Now, more than ever before, I am aware of the responsibility resting on our shoulders and the role that the European Union can play in promoting a new model of development to help us recover from the crisis. In Rio, we failed to set an example, and we did not provide any evidence that we were applying and following through with our ambitions in terms of sustainable development in all our European policies. What we now have to do is activate the transition at European level and at the level of the Member States. Without further ado, let us introduce innovative financing and implement the financial transaction tax and the environmental tax. Without further ado, let us initiate our energy transition so as to put an end to fossil fuels. Let us commit to the conservation of our marine and terrestrial resources. Let us get on with it! This will strengthen the credibility of the European Union and give it greater international weight. It will also enhance the prospects of the international human community for a better future. Let us resolutely commit ourselves, once again, right here and now, to the work programme adopted in Rio to accelerate change. Above all, let us also reaffirm our ambitions and try to make headway in the next two meetings in 2012: on biodiversity in Hyderabad and on climate in Doha. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, our Parliament will vote on the ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). It is because this treaty is a threat to public and digital liberties and to fundamental rights (freedom of expression, protection of personal data and private life), but also because it will lead to unacceptable restrictions in terms of information sharing in the fields of culture, agriculture, health and innovation to the benefit of certain groups, that we must reject ACTA. After three years of political and technical sparring, will our Parliament, the one and only direct representative of the European citizens, live up to the expectations and the trust of the thousands of citizens who have protested on the streets of Europe and inundated us with e-mails, the three million Europeans who have appealed to our Committee on Petitions, the citizens who elected us? Yes, by voting against ACTA and in favour of freedoms. Tomorrow, it is the citizens’ lobby which must win in order to say ‘Bye bye ACTA, welcome democracy!’. Welcome European democracy and citizens’ democracy. Welcome to the 21st century and the digital age. Our choice, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is political, and it is a rejection of the world proposed to us by ACTA. Sandrine Bélier,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Seeber. This report provides a clear overview of the issues surrounding implementation of water legislation, in particular, and also gives a very good insight into possible solutions, especially in terms of more widely applicable, cohesive policies for this vital resource and its preservation. Among the report’s positive elements, and one that we must address as a matter of urgency, is its reaffirmation that water is a shared resource of humankind and that an integrated approach is needed. It also emphasises the duty of moderation of all sectors and all users in every EU country in their use of water, and calls once again for an objective assessment and urgent review – and perhaps even the phasing out – of all public subsidies and funding that are harmful to the preservation of water quality. I regret the fact that the report does not place enough emphasis on the urgency of reducing urban, industrial and agricultural diffuse pollution by all possible means. We still need to make a greater commitment to protecting aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, through regulatory oversight of our soils, among other things, so that eventually, we will achieve ‘good status’ throughout the European Union, as unfortunately, this will not be achieved by 2015. We have tools that we must develop and harmonise, but above all, we have objectives that we must meet without delay. All we need to do now is to put them into practice. We are counting on the European Commission to make sure this happens. Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work. This report proposes a new strategy to 2020 to combat biodiversity loss, the pace of which, as has been pointed out, is continuing to accelerate dangerously. It aims to remind us of the extent to which our systems and our future are intimately linked to the conservation of our natural and genetic capital – for our food, our health and the fight against climate change – and it highlights the extent to which our future economic development is linked to our ability to conserve biodiversity. Let us remind ourselves that, each year, we are losing 3% of global GDP due to biodiversity loss, that the costs of inaction are far higher than the necessary investment costs and are not simply financial and that urgent measures are needed before the cost becomes too high and the loan taken out can no longer be repaid. Our report calls for two immediate measures: the development of innovative financial mechanisms and the elimination of all environmentally harmful public subsidies. However, this report also insists on the need to enshrine our development strategies in a medium and long-term vision and to place the challenges of preserving biodiversity at the heart of our sectoral policies and, first and foremost, at the heart of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the forestry policy. If this dimension of integration and ambitious commitments were to disappear from the text during today’s vote, we would be depriving ourselves of one of the main levers for action, and my group would not be able to vote for this report. Furthermore, I call on my conservative colleagues not to reject the unblocking of the framework directive on soil protection. Today, 48% of European soil is heavily degraded. This degradation has a cost estimated by the Commission at just under EUR 40 billion annually. Only ambitious action taken at European level can save us from this infernal spiral of the artificial development and sterilisation of our land. Finally, it is because we need to learn from our past mistakes and look to the future, and beyond Europe, that we have also introduced a reference to the next Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. Meanwhile, this report is one of the key stages of our determination and of the role of the European Union to succeed where yesterday we failed. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have one minute to call your attention to the ACTA treaty, an international anti-counterfeiting treaty which is not limited to counterfeiting. Patents and online activity are clearly included in the text in unacceptable conditions. Last Saturday, tens of thousands of people protested throughout Europe. More than two million citizens signed a petition against the treaty. Several governments are stepping back — Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia — in the name of defending civil rights. Germany has withheld its decision while it waits to hear the European Parliament’s position. Nineteen Sakharov Prize laureates and several NGOs have expressed their opposition. However, the European Commission is turning a blind eye and trying to force the treaty through. Today, I am launching an appeal to the representatives of the European people from all of the parties within this Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are relying on us to ensure the respect and protection of freedom of expression, freedom of information, access to generic medicines, personal data and details about their private lives, all of which are threatened by this treaty. They are relying on us to defend their freedoms and their fundamental rights and to block ACTA, as it has been presented to us in its current state. We must not disappoint them, we must be demanding and say no, vote against ACTA. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE
).

 Madam President, this European Parliament resolution on the neutrality of the Internet shows our capacity to play a concrete role in the transformation from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. Ensuring that fundamental rights are respected in this new economy is crucial from all points of view. We are therefore delighted with the spirit of this resolution, which considers the Internet as a new area of democracy and which points out the importance of ensuring respect for fundamental rights related to or dependent on the web’s neutrality, such as freedom of expression, the protection of private data and media pluralism. It also highlights the importance of ensuring respect for values such as the sharing of and access to knowledge for the greatest number of people and of allowing no exceptions in the application of legal proceedings that enforce the respect of these rights. We hope that this resolution will lead us towards the recognition and enshrinement of the right to Internet access in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Finally, we also hope that this resolution will find support within the Commission and the Council so as to strengthen the European regulatory framework, and in particular, its application in all of the Member States to truly ensure an open and free Internet for every European citizen.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the context in which preparations are taking place for the fourth Earth Summit is difficult. It is incumbent upon us, of course, to tackle the financial and economic crisis in the euro area. However, one crisis does not chase away another and they are often linked. Indeed, the debt crisis does not affect only Greece and European finances. The crisis is not just financial. It is also a social and ecological crisis, which has to be brought to an end. Today, we are running an ecological deficit. We began to eat into our credit forty years ago and the debt has been growing ever since. Inequalities are getting worse, assaults on mother nature are mounting every year, with imbalances in the weather system, deforestation, collapsing fish stocks and loss of biodiversity being the most flagrant signs. There is only one solution for humanity: it must settle its debt. For this to happen, it behoves the policy makers of this world to act in solidarity, now, in 2012, not in 10 years’ time. I believe that the European Union has a crucial role to play and that the fourth Earth Summit in Rio in June 2012 is the ideal framework for making further commitments, for changing our economic development models, and for moving towards a new green economy. Let us say ‘yes’ to an economy that consumes fewer resources, a fairer economy, an economy that is committed to ecological sustainability and social justice; ‘yes’ to new indicators going beyond GDP; ‘yes’ to the principle of bioconditionality; but ‘no’ to the commoditisation and privatisation of common assets; and ‘no’ to the reproduction of the models that have brought us to where we are today. Let us say ‘yes’ to an international status for environmental refugees; ‘yes to greater responsibility, justice and environmental democracy. We, elected representatives, 20 years later, what do we say to Severn Suzuki? What will our response be if another child stands up in Rio in June 2012 and expresses her fear of the future, her inability to understand the inequalities that exist across the world and implores us to act before it is too late? The resolution we will vote on tomorrow is one of the elements of that response. This resolution, as adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is an ambitious, firm and responsible position, and I call on my fellow Members not to weaken it. I call on the Commission and the Council to give it the scope it deserves at the highest level for sustainable development on a global scale. (Applause) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to consider that the exact and original wording of paragraph 35 of the resolution, which is put to the vote and which stresses that corporate social responsibility should include biodiversity, is the French version, and that that should be the version used. Moreover, the word ‘social’, which has disappeared from the English version, should be reinserted and the version corrected. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, you invited us to vote for the original text of paragraph 16. However, there was a separate vote beforehand, and paragraph 16 was amended. There were two separate votes. Therefore, we voted for the original text but not for the amendment. Sandrine Bélier,

Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitments made in 1992 in Rio and in 2002 in Johannesburg have not been respected. Our strategies for halting the loss of biodiversity have been a failure, and we know the reasons for this failure. The climate is changing, biodiversity is diminishing, and humanity must be determined to adapt itself more and more quickly, and in ways which are more and more difficult. In Nagoya, with a few weeks to go before Cancún, the European Union has the opportunity to argue in favour of adapting our economic development model to face up to the challenges of the 21st century. Climate deregulation, halting the loss of biodiversity and combating poverty: these three challenges, and the responses needed to face up to them, are intimately linked. We have the responsibility of proposing and introducing a new development model which is fairer, more equitable and more sustainable. So let us speak clearly and practically. Parliament’s resolution identifies three key challenges which now raise several questions about the Commission’s and the Council’s position. The first challenge, of course, is to start protecting and restoring biodiversity. This presupposes adequate financing, the withdrawal of all public aid which is harmful for biodiversity and a dedicated budget which we propose should be multiplied tenfold. However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same? The second challenge is the cost of biodiversity loss to society, which has only just begun to be evaluated. It is thought to be around 1% of global GDP, but this evaluation does not take into account the social, cultural, moral and scientific value of biodiversity. Is the European Union determined to resist the monetisation of living things? Is it determined to defend the common inheritance of humankind and to reaffirm that nature is priceless and is not for sale? Finally, the third challenge is to stop the pillaging of genetic resources by businesses and industries. One solution is to regulate access to genetic resources in a way which, in particular, respects fully the rights of indigenous and local communities. The European Union will still have a particular responsibility in these negotiations. As such, is it determined, firstly, to defend the principle of the non-patentability of life and, secondly, to support the repayment of the ecological debt to the countries of the South by supporting the retroactivity of the system which is to be adopted? Sandrine Bélier,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been mentioned, it is the International Year of Biodiversity and, this year, we are being asked to commit ourselves to resolving a triple crisis. The three interconnected elements require a consistent and integrated approach if we are to tackle them and emerge from an ecological crisis that has direct repercussions for our economy and our social model. This triple crisis involves food security, climate change and loss of biodiversity. I should like to remind you that biodiversity has no price attached, but its loss, its decline and its destruction do have a cost which contributes to the increase in poverty and which engenders inequalities and considerable losses in economic, welfare and cultural terms. As has already been mentioned – and we now know it for sure – 40% of our world economy depends directly on services provided by nature, and 60% of these are in sharp decline. Europe has lost 30% of its biodiversity over the past 40 years. This loss is currently valued at 1% of the EU’s GDP – EUR 50 billion per year – and it might reach EUR 14 000 billion in 2050 if we do not take action, since the decline is accelerating and the causes of the failure of previous EU policies in this area are well known and are clearly set out in the report. The measures to be taken are also set out in the report. We are therefore hoping for a large vote in its favour, and we should like to thank Mrs de Lange for her work. We now have to move from words and intentions to deeds; from objectives to means. I find it difficult to hide several regrets: the lack of responsiveness on the part of the Council and of the Commission despite the need for urgent action; the regret that Soil Directive IV is still being blocked by the Council; the regret that bio-conditionality of all public financing was rejected by just one vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; and the regret that the challenges associated with biodiversity have not been more extensively incorporated in the EU 2020 strategy, so as to ensure a sustainable exit from the crisis through the greening of our economic model. There is a need for consistency. There is still time to understand and to commit ourselves to ensuring that our natural capital is preserved and enhanced. This is a winning investment for the future.

Madam President, France is the only Member State that did not anticipate the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and that is refusing to abide by the outcome of the European elections of June 2009. By accepting the third option – the French exception – of appointing two new MEPs, we are being asked to endorse a serious violation of the Union’s primary legislation: the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, from which we have derived our legitimacy for 31 years. Are we going to abide by the Council’s decision, under pressure from one Member State, which shows a certain lack of regard for the Union and the European citizens? Our Parliament must not sanction this serious breach of the principle of European democracy. We must refuse to undermine our legitimacy and our credibility as elected representatives of the European public. It is the European citizens who choose who they want to represent them in the European Parliament, not the governments of the Member States. This French exception justifies our demand for Parliament to be involved, in the case of a convention on the revision of the Treaties, and to reject any intergovernmental conference.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you touched on the subject of storm Xynthia, which has just struck Western Europe causing the deaths of almost 60 people and considerable material damage. I am extremely sad today, but also angry because this human catastrophe could have been avoided; at the least, its impacts could have been limited. Until recently in France and throughout Europe today, coastal areas and flood zones are being developed in spite of and in violation of current European, and indeed national, legislation. These are often Natura 2000 sites, and their protection from urbanisation is essential to limit the effects of similar natural events. It is up to us to demonstrate greater accountability, to make sure that Community regulations – in particular, the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive – are strictly applied by Member States, and to make the Structural Funds conditional on the requirements of sustainability, safety and biodiversity. The EU 2020 strategy is a unique opportunity to redefine our relationship with the environment. (The President cut off the speaker) Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

I am sorry, Mr President. This is my first time, I checked that the procedure was correct and meanwhile … please accept my apologies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the year that the UN has declared the ‘International Year of Biodiversity’, I would like to draw your attention to the failure of the 2004-2010 European Strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity. 40% of our natural heritage is under threat. The state of biodiversity is a measure of the state of health of the planet, of the state of health of our development system, and the crisis phenomenon is accelerating. Therefore, I hope that, today and tomorrow, the European Union and the European Parliament will be able to rise to the challenges and come up with ambitious and wide-ranging objectives to halt the loss of biodiversity in all sectoral policies in 2010. We must act, there is still time, and 2010 is a year in which anything is possible. I hope we will be able to do better than we did in Copenhagen. Sandrine Bélier  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 November, Parliament was given the Council’s guarantee that any restrictions on internet access can only be made if certain conditions are met: prior, fair and impartial procedure; a guarantee of the principle of presumption of innocence and the respect for privacy; and respect for the European Convention on Human Rights. This agreement is the first step towards better protection for citizens faced with growing attempts made by certain States and private operators to trivialise the principle of flexible response, data storage and the control of digital exchange on the internet. That, however, is not enough. Accepting restrictions on digital freedoms and going against net neutrality is not acceptable. It is contrary to the Lisbon Strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the Union. As the sole directly elected European institution, in order to protect citizens’ interests, Parliament now has the moral and political duty to take up this issue and define the rights and duties of internet users so as to guarantee their digital freedom and access to knowledge. We will vote in favour of this text, but we will make sure that we take the matter further tomorrow. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot address the Presidency, since it is not here. We spend our time, in our constituencies and our countries, defending Europe, saying: ‘There will be no way out of the crisis without Europe!’. Europe is complicated: it is made up of 27 states, soon to be 28, and it is always extremely difficult to come to and implement European decisions quickly. Forgive me, Commissioner, but when I listen to you, I think: ‘I hope workers in the photovoltaic sector are not watching the video of your speech!’, because they are going to say to themselves: ‘Is this the Europe that is supposed to be protecting me?’. For years, we have been told that the fight against climate change, renewable energy objectives, green industry and the green economy would be pillars of European growth and the European economy. Today, what are we seeing? We are seeing European institutions that are, in part, petrified by China, and which are taking months and months to potentially react or take provisional measures. How can we justify to these workers, and to all those who are fighting for Europe to protect industry and protect workers, the fact that the United States have, in the space of a few weeks, taken strong measures, imposing import tariffs of up to 250 %, while in Europe, we finally got around to opening an investigation in September and may have provisional measures by July, or failing that, by the end of the year? It is true that First Solar
 has already closed its sites in Germany; it is true that the news about Q Cells
 is now history. How many small and medium-sized enterprises are in difficulty today, however? Even if they do not make it into the news, they are in difficulty. Thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs are under threat. So, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee, we urge you to accelerate the process of introducing provisional measures. Europe was a leader, with ambitious goals on renewable energy and a strong renewable energy industry working alongside it. Today, we are losing that industry, while a real trade war is taking place between the United States and China in the strategic sector of renewable energy, which is so crucial to our competitiveness and our future energy policy. It seems that today, the European Union has once again opted to wait indefinitely. At this rate, the decision will be taken by default. When there is no European photovoltaic industry left, there will no longer be any point in taking measures: you will be able to rest at ease!

 Thank you, Mr Caspary, for your question, which gives me the opportunity to continue to elaborate on this subject. I find it extremely compelling that the entire Committee on International Trade – which is hardly known for its protectionism – is, through this probing oral question, calling on the Commission to go faster. It is not entirely insignificant that it should be a German coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and a German coordinator of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who are now saying that measures must be taken, while Germany has regularly said: ‘Let us avoid any problems with China, let us avoid any trade war with China!’. The European Parliament is therefore united, Commissioner, in calling on you to accelerate the procedures. We must save these jobs. We must do as China and the United States have done and finally endow ourselves with an industrial policy that defends itself through trade instruments. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, if the world warmed by 4°C we would see a torrent of disasters, including extreme heat waves, a reduction in food stocks and a rise in sea level, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Those words are not taken from the Doha briefing brochure of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, as you know, from the World Bank report, which also states that the fight against global warming is an economic opportunity. However, it seems that the international negotiations are not making any headway and are waiting for 2015. We must obviously avoid what led to the Copenhagen failure: trying to reach an agreement right before the end of Copenhagen and not preparing it adequately beforehand. Doha is an extremely important meeting. It seems that conservatism of all kinds is taking precedence over the urgency and the new economy, especially this new carbon-free economy, so the European Union needs to set an example. Here, once again, the Union seems to be dragging its feet: when it comes to aviation, climate change caused by agrofuels, the restriction on the coal market and ‘hot air’, the European Union’s most recent decisions have been bad decisions. We know that you are ambitious, Commissioner. We need to be ambitious in Doha and we need to continue to try to convince your colleagues in the Commission and us in the European Parliament to ensure that Europe continues to lead the way.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we sometimes see astonishing things in this Parliament. When we talk about human rights in China, we hear people say: ‘we need to do business with China because that will encourage respect for human rights in China’. When revolutions happen in Arab countries, we hear people say: ‘we must organise free trade agreements with the Arab countries because that is how we can support the emergence of democracy in the Arab countries’. All of a sudden, trade becomes a purely technical, and highly complicated, issue that has no connection with politics. We know, unfortunately, that this agreement does not guarantee the origin of the products that will enter the European market: firstly, pharmaceutical products and then other industrial products. Not even a week ago, Mr Netanyahu’s Government announced the legalisation of unauthorised settlements and the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank, and all this with an eye on the election on 22 January. At a time when Europe is going to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of its past and, above all, the history it must build, particularly with its neighbours, it would be an aberration for Europe to send out a message that it is upgrading its political relations with Israel, rewarding the Netanyahu Administration for all of its politics, which are constantly criticised by the EU bodies, especially Baroness Ashton. What we are doing here is sending a message to Israel: ‘you must vote for Mr Netanyahu so that he continues his settlement policy, his policy of infringing human rights’. We are in favour of referring the report back to committee for all of the reasons that Mr Moreira gave. It is crucial that Europe does not get involved in the Israeli elections and does not send a message of support to Mr Netanyahu.

Blue-card answer

As you know, it is extremely difficult to trace the origin of all of the products that come from Israel. Therefore, even if there is no definitive proof today that pharmaceutical products are produced in certain territories, that does not mean that that will be the case in the future, especially when there is a desire to expand the settlements and there may be other industrial products that would not offer a guarantee that they are not manufactured in the Occupied Territories. Sir, do not hesitate to look at the voting list of the Greens for every vote we hold on trade agreements: you will see that we are consistent with regard to respect for human rights, the environment and social rights.

 Mr President, tomorrow, Parliament should reject the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). This is good news for democracy, because it sanctions a negotiation process which has chosen confidentiality and opacity over transparency and the involvement of Parliament. I know that it is not your fault, Commissioner. This is good news for democracy, because Parliament will choose culture, agriculture, health and communication over large industrial groups. I am shocked to hear that certain Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believe that the general interest is that of large industrial groups and not that of citizens when they become involved in a social issue. This is good news for democracy, because millions of citizens have taken to the streets and have held a large-scale social debate, and I am happy that some MEPs in this Chamber have changed their minds in favour of democracy. Lastly, this is good news for democracy, because we will finally have, within our European societies, a debate on the balance between public freedom and information sharing, on the one hand, and fair remuneration for creativity and innovation, on the other.

Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that someone is taking notes for the Danish Presidency. We also share the positive view on this resolution. It is extremely important for us that the Council be able to hear the voice of Parliament on the mandate. I believe that the institutional agreement framework is clear. It is not a binding opinion but, in view of both the economic and social crises, and the trade deficits that we have in Europe, it is absolutely essential to get trade agreements and the content of the negotiations right. For that reason, should it happen, for once, that the Council listens to what Parliament has to say before establishing the negotiating mandate, I think that we could take a step forward in terms of the quality of the agreements that we can approve. I think that recent experience, including the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), shows that from a policy standpoint, it would be wise to listen to what Parliament has to say before entering into negotiations. For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is not a question of obtaining, pre-negotiation, concessions from the Japanese, as certain groups understand it. We are simply saying: let us have a transparent negotiation process that is clear, and thereby not enter into several negotiation processes at the same time. Let us have a clear mandate with which we can start negotiations. That also raises some questions. Conducting negotiations with Japan and with the United States also raises some questions. In our Committee on International Trade, we have, on several occasions, had discussions with Pascal Lamy and today this process marks a break. Entering into negotiations with a large trade bloc such as Japan or the United States marks a break in the European position and, as such, puts to one side, or takes note of, the failed negotiations that took place in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must take greater consideration of the consequences of these negotiations, in particular, when they primarily concern the regulatory system, investments, public markets, and all of the regulatory frameworks rather than tariffs. We must consider what bilateral negotiations signify as opposed to multilateral negotiations. Then, Commissioner, you said that 90%, I believe, of the growth – this is your figure – will take place outside of Europe. I am not sure that Japan is the most dynamic area right now, but to benefit further from this international growth means being able to sell, which entails having a strategic vision of our economy and our industrial sector. Once again, I regret the fact that we have some 20 trade negotiations ongoing around the world without having an industrial policy, without knowing what we want for our economy, for example, for our automotive industry over the next 20 years.

Blue-card question.

 I have a quick question for Mr Caspary: is it already the case that despite the conditions that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) imposed with regard to concluding an agreement, it has already voted against a free trade agreement? Now a subsidiary question: does Mr Caspary recall a single impact assessment concerning the implementation of a free trade agreement which can confirm all the benefits which were announced when the free trade agreement was negotiated, be they social or economic benefits? Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, it goes without saying that failing to comply with social and environmental standards and human rights also creates an imbalance between the EU and China. However, we also need to put our own house in order. There would be no such imbalance with China, no such lack of consistency in the EU approach, if we had a common European position with regard to China. China has imposed multi-bilateral relations on Europe, and the burden of responsibility for having such an imbalance with China lies heavily with Member States. Of course, all Chinese products entering the European market must comply with internal standards. That is the law. Once the European Union is a genuine player in multilateral negotiations on achieving, in particular, binding social and environmental standards, and countries like China refuse to accept a framework of internationally binding standards, we believe that Europe is then entitled to impose standards regarding these equally international issues right at the entrance to the European market. These could include, for example, freedom of association. When this time comes, would Europe not be legitimate in deciding that all products entering the European market must come from countries that respect freedom of association? The protection of workers is a given fact here and this should also be the case in those countries. Then there is the issue that is key right now, namely, the issue of the photovoltaic industry. The European Union has always been at the forefront of renewable energy. In Europe, we try to have both targets for renewable energy and, until recently, a renewable energy industry. China has launched a price war on renewable energy and, in particular, photovoltaics. Through subsidies, it has developed production overcapacity that is killing off the European photovoltaic industry. This is a key point, a crucial moment for Europe. Do we, like the United States, protect our photovoltaic industry to support our goals for renewable energy or do we not? Thousands of jobs are currently being lost, which is why we call on the European Commission to come back to Parliament with an analysis of China’s strategy in the photovoltaic market and whether the US response is the right way to go. We clearly want to be thinking along these lines. We cannot be defending our targets for renewable energy without defending the European renewable energy industry. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, you mentioned the European legislation on CO2 
emissions from cars. This was already one of the Commission’s initiatives in 1995. Yet, faced with the lobby by large car manufacturers, what should have been achieved in 2005 will not be achieved until 2015. I would like it if, at some point, democracy were allowed to function and citizens were able to see the transparency of what is being debated in Parliament, because those on the conservative benches who claim to protect the citizens are today abandoning them in the face of rocketing fuel bills. They are abandoning the workers in the face of the relocation of an industry that has failed to innovate and that has left our territories. They are abandoning the citizens of the whole world in the face of climate change. Yes, we find ourselves in a complicated situation. We are facing a twofold problem. Firstly, we have governments that seem incapable of changing their software, incapable of imagining an economic model that is anything other than household debt, State debt or climate debt. Then, we are seeing lobbies in this situation that are stepping into the breach of this conservatism. Nuclear energy, carbon sequestration, oil sands and shale gas lobbyists are trying to take advantage of this political indecision. Ms Hedegaard, your Roadmap is not perfect, Mr Davies’ report is not perfect, but it would be irresponsible of Parliament to validate the complete irresponsibility of Poland. We will vote for this report. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr Helmer, could you confirm that in Great Britain, EDF, E.ON and RWE are in the process of negotiating a feed-in tariff for nuclear energy of nine to 12 cents per kWh, a price that is currently higher than that of onshore wind energy, which is seven cents per kWh? Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you; you managed to avert disaster in Durban. You managed to put across the idea that there is a suitable framework for negotiations but, on the other hand, nothing has actually been triggered to stem climate change. With the notable exception of Poland, you gained the support of Member States to champion these negotiations but you know, unfortunately, you do not have the same consensus from Member States to implement an ambitious climate policy. What I propose, Commissioner, is that DG CLIMA, which you run, makes its contribution to getting Europe out of the crisis, by explaining how an ambitious climate policy could significantly help us get out of the crisis through energy efficiency, through energy savings, through renewable energy, through innovation in technology. Maybe then we would have a document which would allow us to fight – us in the Member States, you at European level –so that the old economy loosens its grip on our political leaders and the new economy may finally emerge.

 Mr President, it is very good of you to give me the floor. I had not planned to speak. I should just like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the teams who worked on this issue. It was tough negotiating with the Council, but I believe that we have come up with a very constructive report. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, Commissioner, some of us were in Doha when we launched the Doha Round. We are well aware that the Round was, in a way, stillborn: it had so many contradictions in its genes that it could not succeed, but it was the international situation – it was just after 11 September – that ultimately forced all the countries to sign in Doha. What we are seeing above all today is not a crisis of confidence within the international community, but a crisis of globalisation. We need to stop thinking about ever more liberalisation and focus instead, of course, on regulation, in a world in which every one of us today can see the damage caused by the globalisation of trade, whether it be from an environmental point of view or from a social point of view. What kind of economy does Europe want to create for itself? How can we put a stop to environmental, social, fiscal and monetary dumping? How can we ensure that people can exercise their trade union freedom throughout the world without restriction? How can Europe make global trade dependent on the recognition and exercise of trade union freedom? These are the questions that we need to be asking ourselves today, that Europe needs to ask itself when it operates within a multilateral framework. We must acknowledge that the Doha Round is finished, adopt a package that is limited and restricted to the least developed countries and, above all, launch an ambitious and transparent process for reforming the World Trade Organisation, one that guarantees the fair participation of all stakeholders and safeguards the interests of the weakest countries in particular, that makes trade law subject to social legislation, environmental law and, of course, human rights, and that actually promotes a multilateral regulatory agenda that puts globalisation back where it belongs. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, Commissioner, you are not being attacked personally in this matter, Commissioner, but you must understand that we are extremely disappointed that the Commission has given in so easily to pressure from some Member States, and France in particular. So we do indeed want to phase out nuclear power because we believe that this is the only way to eliminate the nuclear risk. In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years. We want to have real tests, and we cannot accept the fact that France has been successful in allowing the risky option to go forward. The tests do not predict airplane crashes, either over fuel ponds or over reactors. Neither do they predict terrorist attacks. We refuse to accept the fact that the tests applied at European level have become a communications exercise by a crisis unit for the nuclear industry, which Mr Sarkozy will showcase at the next G8 in order to sell even more European pressurised water reactors (PWRs). That is what we cannot accept, Commissioner. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Indeed, Mr Liese, this resolution was co-signed, and I would also like to respond to Mrs del Castillo Vera who said that the French public is in favour of nuclear energy. That is not true. All the surveys show that 77% of French people want to move away from nuclear energy, but in France we cannot have that debate. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact the first major Free Trade Agreement that Europe has passed for some years, and when it comes to free trade agreements, it must be said that you do not lack ambition – South Korea, Canada, India, Mercosur. There is not a single country or area that escapes the European Commission’s ambitions where free trade agreements are concerned. In the case of this agreement, we have seen that there will only be winners, but I still wonder who the winners will be when I am told that they will be in the agricultural sector. As the elected representative of Brittany, I can tell you that in in that region which produces more than 60% of French pigmeat, the few benefits to be had by the agri-food product firms do not compensate for reductions in tourism, degradation of the environment and the health of workers, and farmers’ losses. There are, indeed, also a great number of losers, and do we, here, have a vision of what economic and social Europe will be like after all these free trade agreements have been signed? No we do not, and nor do we know, at the end of the day, whether there will be any industrial or economic sector left to benefit from these free trade agreements. Moreover, and most importantly, Commissioner, try as you might to tell us that we are not questioning South Korea’s environmental and climate policy, that is not true. We are going to be able to export enormous saloon cars, those cars of which the manufacturers who make the least amount of effort to combat climate change are rewarded by this agreement. For the first time, the European Union is questioning the climate policy of one of its trading partners. Has the European Commission started to change, under pressure from Canada, its directive on fuel quality? We believe that we are putting Europe’s ambitions in the wrong order: the environment and the climate must come before trade. That is why our group will vote against this agreement. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at this early stage, to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue, which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements. The subject is an important one. As you all know, the forest is receding. Every two seconds, across the world, the equivalent of a football pitch is destroyed; within a year, an area the size of Greece is deforested. Clearly, this is a tragic situation. It is tragic from the point of view of diversity: a few thousand plant and animal species are threatened, and the forests which are most affected – tropical forests – contain half of the world’s biodiversity. It is obviously tragic, too, from the point of view of climate change: deforestation is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, deforestation puts some hundreds of millions of people in danger – people who either live in the forests or live off them. Forest exploitation and the forestry industry are among the principal causes of deforestation, particularly in the area on which we are focusing today: the Congo basin. It is estimated that 20 to 40% of the timber felled and exchanged in the world is illegal timber. The issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one. These voluntary partnership agreements have been approved in the context of the approval procedure within the Committee on International Trade. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this procedure allows the European Parliament to express its view. At the same time, however, it can only say yes or no. Hence, this debate is extremely important because it allows us to go into more detail, and it allows you, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, to respond to the questions that Parliament is putting to you. These agreements are important; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber. They also put in place independent verification procedures, and supplement forest policies and governance in the countries concerned. Today, we are talking about the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. However, I would like to make an initial point before going into these agreements and Parliament’s questions: we really must differentiate between legal timber and sustainable timber. Obviously, we are dealing with the legality of timber here, but legal timber does not necessarily mean sustainable forest exploitation. Therefore, the first general question that I would ask the Commission is: how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests – 2011 is the International Year of Forests – while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún, in particular, on the REDD+ mechanism, and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated, which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber? Next, we are still waiting for an answer from the European Commission on the question of biofuels and indirect changes in land use. As you know, Parliament has asked you to integrate these issues into the criteria for evaluating the sustainability of biofuels. More specifically, concerning the voluntary partnership agreements, there are many positive elements: we greatly appreciated the negotiation efforts and, in particular, the involvement of members of civil society in Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. We know that it is not easy and, from this point of view, these voluntary partnership agreements seemed to be a success. As I was saying just now, however, a number of questions and requests remain. Commissioner, are you ready to come, for example, every six months, or six months after the signing of an agreement, to update us on the implementation of the agreement? I ask because it is clear that the negotiation and the implementation of the agreement may be of a very different quality. We would therefore like you to come and tell us if the parties concerned, in particular, the members of civil society, continue to be involved in its implementation. In countries in which it is still not easy to complain, particularly when corruption exists, have complaint mechanisms been provided for – in particular, independent ones – so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to? In the same way, we would like you to regularly report on the impacts of the implementation of these agreements, so that you can tell us where we have got to with them, both in terms of the overall consistency of the Commission’s actions on forests, and in terms of their specific implementation on the issue of the legality of timber. Lastly, a final point: you claim that there is no budget in these agreements. Yet we will obviously need budgets to support these policies, so can you clarify the budgetary issue in relation to these voluntary partnership agreements? Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, once again, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. I believe that we have almost all spoken in the same terms: making this essential point about VPAs, which provide the link between development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society. I believe that, if there is one tool that we can use today to bring about sustainable development in these countries, particularly the African countries, it is undoubtedly the strengthening of civil society. As long as the only or the main expression of democracy in those countries is the vote to elect the President, then as we have seen – as the history of Côte d’Ivoire unfortunately reminds us – we will not make sufficient progress. Therefore, strengthening civil society – the fact that it plays a constant role in the implementation of these agreements, in the monitoring of forest exploitation, in the discussion on the conditions of this exploitation and in the sharing of revenues linked to this forest exploitation – is essential. It is through this strengthening of civil society, too, that we will respond best to the argument that we often hear concerning China: ‘Why should we meet the criteria for strong cooperation with Europe – social, democratic and environmental criteria – when China makes a mockery of them in terms of corruption and pillaging?’ Well, strengthening civil society is the best defence against this system which China, in particular, is trying to impose on the countries of the South. Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also – and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry – a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries. Thank you for your desire to work with the European Parliament. We are very happy about this future collaboration. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, like Mr Leinen, I wanted to emphasise the remarkable work that Commissioner Hedegaard and her team carried out in Cancún. Today, in a way, the success of Cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that, if the others take no action, we will take no action. The positive aspect of Cancún is that everyone must now engage with the machine of international negotiation, in particular, by strengthening their national or regional objectives. In terms of the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Europe now has to reach 30%. Reaching 30% is part of the objective of obtaining a decarbonised economy by 2050; 20% will not allow us to make this transition. Finally, in reaching 30%, we will also clearly be linking up now with the emerging economies: Brazil, China and South Africa. We know that these countries have some objectives which, up to a point, are currently superior to those of the European Union. We must therefore put a stop to inaction and the strategy of the status quo. The success of Cancún means that we must engage with the process of international negotiation in a much more constructive manner. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and, in principle, clearly, to support the adoption tomorrow of the report adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Let us come now to the unbelievable potential associated with energy savings, a point that has been made here. Reports from the European Commission itself say that if we called a halt to our excessive energy consumption, if we reduced our energy wastage by 20%, we could create one million jobs, we could save almost EUR 1 000 per European household, and we could clearly reduce our external energy bill. A 20% energy saving or reduction in Europe is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos in energy terms, and we are currently missing that target. Mrs Hall made this point, and the way I see it, we have trouble calculating. If reports show today that we are far from achieving 20%, then we can evaluate the savings that we make or do not make each year. We also know that this eco-design or eco-labelling approach for cars and so on does not result in overall coherence and does enable us to obtain the results that we are seeking. I am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here. Excuse me, Commissioner, but when you say that we have a problem in defining energy efficiency, this is perhaps true from a theoretical point of view, but the climate and energy package is very clear on the objective. It says that energy consumption must be reduced by 20% below the baseline level. This problem does not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency. There are energy levels that we need to return to – that is what the climate and energy package says. We are told that we do not need a binding objective. We are thus making one on renewables. A few days ago, in Cancún, the European Commission negotiated a binding agreement on climate change and tried to defend the Kyoto Protocol, and in this House we are citing the arguments of the United States and China by saying: ‘We will go for voluntary targets, and then, if one day we realise that they are not working, we will create binding targets’. With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building. There is scope to take a large-scale European initiative on building, which nevertheless accounts for 40% of our energy consumption; we can go much further on renovation. Finally, citizens are today facing the cold. They are paying very high prices for their energy. If Europe emerges from the crisis, energy will be much more expensive internationally. Citizens will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy prices. We must move much more quickly, and I would also ask you, Commissioner, to please stress to Mr Van Rompuy that the 4 February meeting should also be a meeting about energy consumption. From this point of view, the road map that he is proposing today is outrageous. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, we propose changing the end of paragraph 22 by replacing ‘prevent’ with ‘inform’, so the final phrase becomes:  ‘reiterates also Parliament’s request to the Commission and Member States to inform the European Parliament about loans granted by export credit agencies and the European Investment Bank to projects that have a negative impact on the climate’. Yannick Jadot,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could have limited my speech to simply recalling the images of this summer in Russia or southern Asia, to reminding you of the absolutely urgent need to combat climate change and, since we are talking about Europe, to move immediately, or as soon as we possibly can, to a target of 30% by 2020 for greenhouse gas emissions. Today, if we make no changes, we shall reach 19%. We have practically already reached the target that we set ourselves, so we can no longer speak of European ambition if we speak of 20%. As far as I am concerned, I am not an obvious admirer of the carbon market, but if we stay at 20%, we can be sure that we shall be treating the carbon market as a species in danger of extinction and not as a lever in the fight against climate change. Moving to 30% would potentially raise EUR 8 billion for European budgets by auctioning quotas. We know 30% is possible. In particular, a binding 20% energy efficiency target would mean a million European jobs. This represents savings of EUR 1 000 per household in Europe and, since Commissioner Oettinger mentioned Nabucco, it is the equivalent of 15 Nabuccos. Are we then going to kill off European businesses if we move to 30%? Obviously not. Every study shows this to be so. Some sectors potentially at risk are affected, but the means exist, and until now, the sectors that threaten Europe with extinction are the sectors that have been the beneficiaries of European energy policy. They have gained billions of euros thanks to European climate policy. Moving to 30% would mean clearly siding with those who are bringing about change, siding with those who are making tomorrow’s world. I should also like to cite some figures. According to the Ernst &amp; Young 2010 Barometer, China and the United States are the most attractive countries for the development of renewable energy. According to a recent study, only three of the 50 businesses identified as world leaders in green technology are located in Europe; the others are in Asia or the United States. It is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30%, and I shall conclude by echoing the words of Barack Obama when he said that we could abandon the jobs of the future to our competitors or we could seize the opportunity of the century, as they have already begun to do. The nation that pioneers the energy of the future would be the pioneer nation of the 21st century, he said. He lost the elections. Let us take up this leadership in energy transition and the new economy. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, just as the European Union is trying to redefine its trade policy after the Treaty of Lisbon, while at the same time trying to reconcile it with its industrial policy, the fact that this Parliament is simultaneously debating three reports that address issues ultimately falling within the same political and public debate on ‘what is trade and how can it be reconciled with social, environmental and human rights issues?’ is to be welcomed. In fact, we are ultimately in a state of permanent schizophrenia: everywhere, companies are relocating, social rights are being called into question, environmental degradation is increasing and, at the same time, we are negotiating free trade agreements, we are negotiating within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a whole series of measures which, unfortunately, are totally out of step with the public debate in which our citizens are trying to engage. How can we explain to our public today that a football entering the European market produced under decent working conditions, where the environment is respected, and a football produced by child labour or in a country where trade unions are prohibited is the same football? We cannot explain this to our public. Our responsibility today is therefore to integrate these environmental and social issues into trade. Regarding my report more specifically, with respect to trade there are currently a number of European countries whose imports of products largely offset the reductions in their own emissions. A third of Europe’s emissions are not produced in Europe but correspond to imported goods. It is therefore essential to integrate the climate issue into our trade policies. How can we explain to our public that, at the same time as concluding a free trade agreement which will potentially lead to deforestation, we are going to Cancún to negotiate a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) agreement aimed at providing financial compensation for non-deforestation in the countries of the South? It is therefore essential to reconcile these different issues. When we drafted this report – and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various groups – we tried to be as constructive as possible. I hope this will be reflected in the vote tomorrow. We also tried to put an end to black or white debates. We no longer say that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100% of our industries in Europe, where, in a way, we do not care, because the climate issue must take precedence. When we worked on the issue of carbon leakage, for example, we always tried to specify which sector of activity might be put at risk and which tools could be developed to protect that sector. The same is true for the laws governing the framework for the anti-dumping discussion at the WTO. The same is true for production processes and methods. On all these issues, we tried, with the other groups, to come up with proposals to move things forward, and I believe that we have come up with concrete proposals that are commensurate with our ambitions, with the mandate of the European Commission and of all the European institutions. I would just say once again that I hope that the cooperative, constructive spirit in which we drafted this report will be reflected in the vote tomorrow and, once again, I would like to thank all my colleagues for the work they have done. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Commissioner De Gucht for his answers and for his proposal for work. I have taken note of his reply on the climate chapter, and I hope that we will also manage to work on the remaining aspects and make proposals that will result in concrete action being taken and certain elements being included in the trade agreements. Finally, the fact that the trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, which are undoubtedly very complex, have broken down also offers the European Union various opportunities to integrate more innovative elements into bilateral agreements and to try to construct new types of trade agreements which further integrate the EU’s objectives with regard to the environment, climate, human rights or social rights. This is therefore, in a sense, an opportunity. I believe it is a very strong request, and if these reports receive broad support tomorrow, this will indeed be – and I want to believe it will be – an extremely important signal from the European Parliament to the Commission and to the Council. I would like to reply to Mrs Stassen, who has left, regarding the economy. Books on the economy have continued to be written after the 19th century. We can therefore see that the challenges concerning the way in which to integrate social and environmental issues into production costs are an important factor in terms of defining the reality of comparative advantages. Similarly, Mrs Muscardini, you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the European Union. Moreover, if you are prepared, with me and others, to combat the Blair House Agreement, which is, after all, the main obstacle to real food sovereignty, to real food security today in Europe, you will have my support. Thank you, therefore, to all my colleagues, and to you, Commissioner, for your openness towards concrete work and concrete action with a view to the agreements that will soon be negotiated and concluded. Yannick Jadot,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, Commissioners, I think we must note the convergence of this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and its Committee on International Trade on this matter and on the proposals presented in connection with it. It has been said that fishing is an extremely important sector for spatial planning, employment and cultural identity in Europe. It is also a sector which has an extremely strong impact on fisheries resources, and today a great majority of stocks are considerably overfished. Too often people would have us believe that the ultimate objective of a European common fisheries policy is to adapt the fisheries sector to globalised trade in fishery products, the extremely harsh effects of which we can see today, whether it be socially, economically or, of course, environmentally. We therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products. We support the idea of withdrawing fishery products from non-agricultural market access (NAMA) rules, because a fish is not a sock or a washing machine, it is absolutely crucial to food security and biodiversity. However, we must be clear. Since we are bringing this into international negotiations, our European policy must be exemplary and we must move in the direction of having more and better paid fishermen who do not overexploit fish stocks, either in our territorial waters or in those in which we buy fishing rights.

Mr President, I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment, deleting two parts of the amendment, namely the words ‘by the Colombian army’ and ‘on Colombia’. Therefore, the amendment reads as follows: ‘considers that the alarming news concerning the killings of trade unionists in Colombia, as well as the news recently received and now confirmed by Colombia’s public prosecutor that mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people killed in recent years have been discovered in the region of La Macarena, are sufficient evidence to enable the Commission to open an investigation in accordance with the regulation.’ Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, during the night of 27 to 28 February, storm Xynthia hit western France particularly hard, claiming many lives. Naturally, our thoughts are with the victims and all those who mobilised to help them. We are calling very clearly for the European Commission to make the Solidarity Fund available quickly in order to help the most affected people. However, we must also learn lessons from this tragedy. How is it possible that there are between five and six million people in France living in flood zones? There is obviously pressure from the property lobby, but it is also true that a few months ago, President Sarkozy was calling for construction in flood zones to be permitted. Responsibilities therefore lie with politicians. We are calling for all European cofinancing linked to reconstruction and restoration to be conditional on respect for the law: coastal law and prevention plans relating to flood risk. Naturally, we are also asking once again that we show swift support for all the worst affected sectors, in particular shellfish farming. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Commissioner, it is good that you want to debate the result of this tool before the European Parliament, but the main thing to respect with regard to the European Parliament is the ordinary legislative procedure. We will find this tool useful, but it could be more operational, more effective and more transparent. More effective, in particular, if it took into account all the decentralised energy sources. It is not a matter of counting every single solar panel, but at Member State level we have information that you could gather to see what all the plans for decentralised energy add up to. When we are talking about democracy and transparency, I am surprised to hear our Liberal fellow Member reply ‘bureaucracy’. This instrument must be transparent, it must be debated, and the Commission must consult all the stakeholders, unions and associations, among others. Finally, taxpayers are contributing a great deal to the energy transition effort, and it is important that we have information on funding, to know exactly how taxpayers are funding energy transition in Europe. I hope that the amendments that have been tabled will be adopted by a large number of Members tomorrow, by more than there are here this evening. Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis-related protectionism into its proper context. I think that, in the context of a debate, it is wise of you to point out that a world war linked to the revival of protectionism is not about to break out. Now, I almost want to reverse the issue. For me, the issue is not ultimately about what effects the economic crisis has on trade, but more fundamentally about what effects trade, and specifically the trade policies undertaken for 20 years, have on the crisis we are experiencing today. In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets. In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us. I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it. It follows that, in all the national debates – and, as a key figure on the Belgian scene, you will know this – all the political parties are now discovering that it is impossible, in a globalised world, to manage social dumping, environmental dumping, monetary dumping and fiscal dumping. Similarly, we might consider that the strategy that all us Europeans expected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was to say ‘social democracy will come about through trade’, is not working, as we can see with the example of China. Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure. Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have. Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world? Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure. I have a more specific question: on 4 February 2010, a meeting of the WTO’s Committee on Trade in Financial Services was held, and it focused specifically on the challenges presented by the financial crisis and the liberalisation of financial services. Can you tell us what the outcome of that meeting was and what your opinion is on this matter, if you were able to follow it? Yannick Jadot,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, as you said, this agreement breaks new ground. It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it. Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties. It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship. Secondly, this agreement also breaks new ground because, in trade negotiations, it is usually the farming sectors that resist and the industrial sectors that are satisfied. In this case, we see that the opposite is true. For the first time, it is literally major industrial sectors that are complaining about the decisions made by Europe. Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market. Just what do these figures mean, however? I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany. If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem. Now, we are told that we shall earn a small amount of money from pigs by trading with South Korea. The reality, in the region I represent, is that this intensification of pig farming leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of added value, a loss of tourism and, consequently, in my region, we are the losers in this agreement. Perhaps in your overall calculation, people gain from it, but in a region like mine, people lose. Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for. We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change. The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO2
 emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO2
 emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad. We therefore clearly see once again that, when it comes to an industrial strategy, a strategy for our businesses and the choice of economy, it will be more the case that Europe suffers this agreement than that it shapes it. You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy, the green economy and innovation. I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged. Finally, your approach to discussing issues is often very balanced, but as soon as people start talking about taxes, all of a sudden … On the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the Tobin tax, I bet you, Mr De Gucht, that before the end of your mandate, the Commission will have to speak out strongly on the Tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, I have been very surprised at the self-satisfaction you show with regard to EU action in the climate field. It is true that Europe has done more and better work in the last 10 years than most of the other countries in the world, but there was clearly a failure of European leadership in Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, we also saw Europe become simply the combination of the personal communication strategies of the European Heads of State or Government, and I should like to specifically mention Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Brown in this connection. Under these circumstances, it is clearly easy to knock the UN process. It is true that the UN system is complicated, and that a G20, where the agreements are meaningless but there are opportunities for major publicity stunts, is much simpler. This means that this coming year, Europe must do more and better work. We currently have a 20% target. However, 20% actually means doing less in the next 10 years than we have done in the past 10 years; it means reducing Europe’s climate effort. This is not only absurd for the climate, when the scientists are telling us that we have to reach a 40% target, but it is also absurd for our economy and jobs. Therefore, Mrs Espinosa, please do not reduce Europe’s climate ambition to the lowest common denominator, to the objectives voiced by President Barroso, who does not want to budge from the 20% figure, or to those voiced by Italy and Poland, which will soon deny the existence of climate change. Reread Parliament’s resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30%. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, as we know – according to a number of scientific studies and also Yvo de Boer – emerging countries are today making at least as much effort as Europe with a view to 2020. We also know that, in the negotiations, there is already a right of scrutiny regarding emerging economies, and that this is exercised more and more through the emissions inventory, through the report on the measures taken. The World Resources Institute has published statistics showing that China stands at around 70 tonnes per capita, a cumulative figure since 1950, whereas the United States stands at 810 tonnes and the EU-27 stands at 413 tonnes. We therefore kindly ask you to have the good sense, first and foremost, to use the European Parliament resolution as a negotiating mandate. This would be the best thing we could do for the sake of both the climate and our emergence from the crisis in Europe. Next, I call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to have the intelligence and the credibility to withdraw its amendment that says that emerging countries must do the same thing, must make the same commitments as rich countries. That is not acceptable, that is not serious. Yannick Jadot,

Mr President, after 15 years of negotiating the trade aspect of the Barcelona Process, we have very serious doubts about whether the negotiation of a Euromed-type free trade agreement is the right solution to the social, political and economic problems in the region. The impact assessment, as has been said, above all revealed that there were some potentially very serious negative impacts, whether social, environmental or in terms of regional integration. In this context, Mr President, Commissioner, we believe that the proposal being made by the Commission – the road map for 2010 and beyond – is too one-sided, with its bilateral free trade agreement aspect, to be along the right lines. We support the draft resolution that is being debated today, not least because it asks all these questions relating to social impacts, environmental impacts and impacts on regional integration, and above all because, in paragraph 10, it calls for the aims of the trade agreements to be revisited, particularly in view of these social and environmental issues, and then above all because, by revisiting these agreements, we could perhaps think about reintegrating the trade aspect into the overall Barcelona Process. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths, and inaction, for us, is a crime against humanity. We know that this is an emergency, we know that there is no plan B, and yet, today, the negotiations are at a standstill. It is easy to say that it is the United States’ fault, but we believe that Europe is also hugely responsible. Europe is unfortunately no longer, as the Prime Minister claims, the leader in the climate-change negotiations. Extending Europe’s current commitments to the entire planet means having 4 degrees of global warming by the end of the century, 4 degrees of global warming! That is unacceptable, and it will no longer be enough, as President Barroso is also claiming, to hide behind the legislative character of this commitment alone. Independent studies show today that Japan, Norway and Switzerland are ready to make greater efforts than Europe. With regard to the emerging countries – China, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia – they too are making commitments domestically that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them. If there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel’s speech, it is how to be modest and how to be realistic. Let us stop pretending that everything stands still outside Europe, that the world has not changed since Kyoto, and that Europe is always far ahead of the international community. In refusing to take account of the requests of the European Parliament and, in particular, of its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has assumed responsibility for something very serious: failure at the Copenhagen Summit. It is not too late; Europe can resume its leadership by immediately increasing its reduction target to 30% and by granting at least EUR 30 billion in aid to the countries of the South. In so doing, we will lead the countries of the South and force an agreement out of the Americans. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths and will cause millions more in the future. Inaction is a crime against humanity. This is an emergency, but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill. However, countries such as Japan, Australia, Norway, China, Brazil and South Africa are making efforts that are commensurate with their responsibilities. This is not the case with the United States, and it is unfortunately no longer the case with Europe. Extending Europe’s ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees. That is totally unacceptable. However, it is Europe that holds the key to Copenhagen. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if the European summit, acting on the European Parliament’s recommendations, takes the right decisions at the end of the month, then Europe can boost the negotiations – with targets of a 30% reduction and a EUR 35 billion aid package for the countries of the South. Mr President, the way in which certain Member States today use aid for the countries of the South as a negotiating tool is, in our view, absolutely shocking. The distress of the countries of the South is not a matter for negotiation. Yannick Jadot  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Commissioner, I am an elected representative from a region in the west of France, where there is a very high concentration of dairy farmers, and I do not believe that you have acknowledged the tragic social situation they are experiencing today. Commissioner, when you speak of ‘producers’, what I hear is ‘manufacturers’ and ‘distributors’. Dairy producers do not need your compassion, Commissioner. They do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis. Dairy producers need a genuine agricultural policy. They need strict quotas. That is why we are calling on the Council to overturn your policy and instead to create a genuine policy to support dairy producers and to put an end to this policy of destroying them en masse.Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, during those nine months of work, with the confidence and valuable support of all key players, including – and I say this most emphatically – MEPs, who never gave up the fight for truth and justice, we were able to gain an awareness of the extent of the elements incriminating Europe and the Member States in the implementation of the CIA’s secret programme. All these key players are categorical and all the elements, that is to say, the research carried out by the Council of Europe, the special UN rapporteurs, the Red Cross, national and international human rights organisations, investigative journalists, the testimony of the victims, of their lawyers and of CIA agents, concur: the Member States have to answer for their active or passive complicity in crimes of torture, secret detention and enforced disappearance. For nine months, I was able to see the patently obvious limitations of the investigative steps taken by the Member States and their stubborn determination to conceal the truth: lack of political will, prevalence of national interests, narrow remits for investigations, abuse of state secrecy, lack of transparency, restriction of the rights of victims and of their lawyers. The imagination of national authorities knows no bounds. In putting this report to the vote, Parliament aims to take a decisive step towards putting an end to the denial of reality, and hence of justice, which has characterised the strategy of the EU Member States for 11 years now. Through its recommendations to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, the report expresses a simple and clear will: every effort must be made to ensure that rigorous, independent and transparent investigations, capable of determining responsibilities and obtaining justice for the victims, are concluded. The European Union and the Member States owe it, first and foremost, to the victims, but they also owe it to Europe’s citizens, who are entitled to demand from our institutions, from their institutions, respect for democratic values and the rule of law on which they are based. To be effective, we had to be concrete and specific and to stay abreast of the issue so that we could identify the best levers to help justice move forward. We therefore chose to focus on the issue of secret prisons on EU territory. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of Eurocontrol, which I thank, and to the visits and meetings of the Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) (rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs), today there are grounds for the report to adopt recommendations of relevance to Poland, Lithuania and Romania in particular. These three countries are now before the European Court of Human Rights facing allegations of torture, secret detention and failure to investigate effectively. Your rapporteur is convinced, more than ever, that only a coordinated European approach aimed at supporting Member States can break the code of silence. The challenge for the Council is to take the matter in hand officially and to put it on its work agenda, to acknowledge its responsibility and, finally, to apologise. The Commission, while having taken note of the facts, has still not mobilised all its justice and human rights resources and instruments to ensure that Member States comply with their fundamental obligations. It must take initiatives to uphold the principle of mutual assistance and solidarity. Commissioner Reding, the report invites us, you, the Council, the victims and all those who seek the truth to return to this House in a year’s time. Last week, Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen resident in Germany who had been detained without trial for five years at Guantánamo, again came to Parliament to speak about his ordeal, still very current, and to seek justice for the victims. Commissioner Reding, if Mr Kurnaz has the strength to come back in a year’s time, will we be able to tell him that facts have been established, that responsibilities have been acknowledged, and that we can, finally, apologise to him on behalf of the European Union? (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate to support this work, which has been long and arduous and which, as I said in my introduction, will bring us together again in a year’s time. I think that a lot can be done in the Member States in a year. We are not, of course, prosecutors and we do not have to ‘provide definite proof’. We simply know – if I take the example of Romania – that an investigation has been carried out in the Senate. You have pointed it out; it has been mentioned. I am also aware that there have been numerous allegations. I know that Eurocontrol has found evidence of new flights connecting Romania to Lithuania. A case file, which is mentioned in the complaint against Romania lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, was drawn up by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Hammarberg, and submitted to the authorities. None of these elements forms part of the public findings of the investigation. I think that it is not about singling out individual countries for general opprobrium because colleagues have placed great emphasis – and it is, I hope, a strong aspect of this report – on our collective responsibility. What is, in fact, happening? The reality is that each country holds a fragment of the truth. As a result, each country must carry out its investigations to the best of its ability so as to be able to expose this system because it is, in fact, a system. We have no intention of stigmatising this or that country. It is clear and evident – no one can deny it – that, in Romania, a new investigation, a judicial investigation, must be conducted, because the elements –which do not constitute proof; we are not prosecutors – are nevertheless important enough to warrant the reopening of an investigation. The report calls for nothing more, nothing less. The report asks Romania to conduct an investigation, and calls on the Commission, in fact, to show that each country holds a fragment of the truth and that the Commission, in particular, has the means, the power, the duty and the obligation to ensure that this fragment of truth enlightens other countries so that all EU citizens can be informed. You can do a lot. The rule is noted: you are strict, and I congratulate you on your resoluteness and on your regular interventions on fundamental rights violations within the framework of the implementation of EU law. However, in flagrant cases of unexplained massive violations, the means must be found to be accountable for the violations committed. For example, as regards the issue of interest to us here, you can bring in prosecutors, you can pool, or help to pool, information. You can translate all useful documents. You can gather together information and make it available to the Member States to help them conduct these investigations. The letters you are going to send once again to each Member State – which I welcome – must contain all the new elements that have come to light, including the analyses carried out by Reprieve
 of the data provided by Eurocontrol. That is what we are expecting, that is to say, a lot of work in the next year for a meeting which, I very much hope, will be a resounding success. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, last Thursday, a vessel from Turkey ran aground: 61 people, including 31 children, drowned. Most of them were Syrian refugees. The following night, a vessel sank close to Lampedusa, resulting in the deaths of several dozen people from Tunisia. Each new shipwreck adds to the macabre head count of the thousands of deaths already recorded in the Mediterranean. One has to question the responsibilities of the European Union and its obligations concerning rescue at sea. These people are fleeing war and poverty, but they are also faced with ever more perilous routes due to the obsession with security that characterises our migration policy. I call on the Commission to propose guidelines, as the recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union required it to do, concerning rescue at sea. I also call on the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), which has developed a new human rights strategy, to implement it effectively in order to ensure the security of migrants. This is a humanitarian emergency. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, Ms Schaake has raised a very relevant issue with the Presidency of the Council. I am sure its representative will endeavour to provide a response to it. The situation on the ground, as described, has peaked, reaching new levels of apocalyptic violence and horror – with 800 deaths last week. The Human Rights Watch report, systematic torture in one of the 27 detention centres and the witness reports given are quite unbearable. At the same time, for just over a week now, I think, we have seen fresh diplomatic initiatives which are maybe precursors of the wind of change needed to find a solution. I think, even so, that the meeting held in Geneva made a start – albeit limited and not totally satisfactorily – towards the proposal for a transitional government of national unity, obviously without Assad and his torturers, but including some among its numbers. This has two benefits. In this situation, just because we feel that a solution is possible does not necessarily mean there will be less violence on the ground. Quite the contrary. We could see an escalation of violence by the regime. From this point of view, this proposal both encourages the mass desertions seen among soldiers of the regular army but must also enable acceptance of members of the Assad regime and the Baath Party as part of this interim solution. As things stand, I believe that this is extremely important. I hope that this prospect, which was encouraged by the meeting of all the components of the Syrian opposition, by the Arab League this week, by the meetings of the Russian Foreign Minister with the Syrian opposition, marks a turning point in this situation which offers a glimmer of hope. Moreover, I think that the EU should fully exploit this glimmer of hope, especially at the meeting of the Friends of the Syrian people in Paris at the end of the week. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, your words are hardly of any reassurance to me regarding the European Union’s capacity to take action. To be honest, it is calling on the opposition to unite for the umpteenth time, listing the risks that the situation presents for the umpteenth time, risks that have already been proven and are still very much present: regionalisation, militarisation, communitarisation, etc. These risks are also the result of the international community’s inability to have provided its support in good time to a people’s uprising against a dictator. I also believe that the situation is now so complicated and so difficult that there is no correct solution any more. However, inaction will cost us even more dearly. In other words, in three months’ time, we will be having the same old debate and you will be telling us how militarisation, communitarisation and regionalisation have been exacerbated further. Yes, we need to act then but there is no correct solution. Faced with the need and duty to protect the people, we are practically faced with the dilemma of having to choose whether we should violate international law by bypassing the Security Council. Yet we have to put all the options on the table. I heard Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra talking about a force being present on the ground. I also heard what Ms Brantner had to say. These options need to be looked at. This is absolutely urgent. We then need to put pressure on Russia because Russia, I can assure you, is in a very comfortable position. Today in France, the largest arms-producing company is currently showing at the international exhibition of weapons, in Villepinte, with total impunity. I have not heard anyone in Europe or in France, or you yourselves, dispute this fact. I therefore think that Russia does not feel under any threat whatsoever. We all know it is about the carrot and the stick with Russia. What have you dangled in front of them in your discussions? Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, finally, since the start of this debate there have not been many fellow Members who believe that this agreement does not, in one way or another, undermine the fundamental rights of European citizens. To put it simply, some people are saying ‘It’s better than nothing. It would be worse if there was no agreement. In the end, it’s worth chipping away a little at our rights if we can see a corresponding benefit in terms of security.’ That is what we have been saying recently. Yet we know perfectly well – we have not only been saying it, but we have also demonstrated it – that a policy of combating terrorism, in order to be effective, rather than just being moral or meeting international obligations, must respect the totality of human rights, international law and our obligations. It is extremely hard to believe that this agreement could not be demolished by a court, if ever we in this Chamber were not able to shoulder our political responsibilities, because that is what this is actually about. Will we manage to stand beside the citizens of Europe – past evidence shows that they can only rely on the European Parliament in these areas – or will we allow ourselves to be overawed by threats? We have seen what happened in the past. With regard to the system implemented by the CIA, when there were secret prisons, illegal transfers and torture on our territory, who stood beside us in the Council and in the Commission to set up inquiries and find out who is responsible? No one. We want to cooperate. We have no mechanism of accountability when the services operate outside the legal framework. This is a serious matter.

Mr President, I said that, during our debate here in Parliament, no one denied the fact that we were in the process of seriously eroding the rights of citizens. You say that the citizens are not properly informed. However, you have undermined your case, Mrs Foster. It is a serious problem if we take citizens’ personal details when they themselves are even less able to monitor them because they are not even informed. To be frank, I think it is not sensible to go down a road – and we are going to say this to the European citizens – which would lead to them becoming involved in an American-style system for fighting terrorism, with military tribunals in the absence of procedural safeguards, endless cases of imprisonment and detention without charge. I truly believe that European citizens deserve to be informed of the fate that you want for them, Mrs Foster. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, this is not the first time this issue has been raised. I believe that all the bodies – the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, civil society organisations – have, at some time or other, sounded the alarm. What is more, this alarm has been heard by the Commission. Greece has since launched a national asylum and immigration plan. Today, however, there is no escaping the fact that the situation in the detention centres – and I have visited some in Greece – remains an insult to human dignity, that, since the start of the year, dozens of people have been killed at the Greek-Turkish border trying to cross the River Evros, and that NGOs are now seeing, within the context of the economic and social crisis in Greece, a sudden increase in racist attacks; they have recorded 63 cases in Athens and Patras, 18 of which involved police officers, during the last six months of 2011. It is clear that, in the period leading up to the elections in Greece, we hear preposterous proposals and a surfeit of extremely xenophobic policies – which can only be described as anti-immigrant – like the proposal to build detention centres, but, in particular, the proposal to herd together migrants and asylum seekers suspected of being ill. We also hear political leaders characterise the issue of migrants as a time bomb for society and for the security of the country. Confronted with this, of course, the European Union must respond with its values, its instruments and its principle of cooperation and solidarity. In this regard, it should nonetheless be said to the Member States that threatening Greece with expulsion from the Schengen area is an absolutely scandalous proposal, when, at the same time, the Member States openly regret that the Court prevents them from sending the asylum seekers back to Greece under the Dublin Regulation. Frankly, this cowardice and this hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the European Union cannot be tolerated, and the Commission has a great responsibility in this regard to guarantee our fundamental principles. As far as Turkey is concerned, I believe we should try to look at the situation as it is. With regard to the Community readmission agreement, Turkey is calling for equal treatment. Yet this is absolutely a case of double standards, since there is no prospect of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas with Turkey … (The President urged the speaker to bring her speech to a close)
 and that, at this very moment, Turkey is welcoming thousands of refugees at the Syrian border. I therefore believe that we should stop passing the buck from one country to another and assume this fundamental responsibility jointly. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am very pleased with this report and I would like to take the opportunity to thank its rapporteur, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, who has carried out an extremely comprehensive job. I think that this report, as a whole, calls for and supports the democratic reforms and the protection of fundamental freedoms in Turkey. I believe that the messages that it sends are extremely clear and precise and that they are of course addressed to the authorities, but also to all the actors in the political arena and civil society to encourage them to become more involved in further strengthening the democratic State in Turkey. The report does not fail to make clear our grave concerns regarding the way in which the law against terrorism has been applied, directly threatening freedom of expression and opinion, the right to hold demonstrations, the freedom of the press and we are asking for this law to be amended, particularly Articles 6 and 7. We also support and call for a thoroughgoing reform of the judicial system: citizens, all citizens in Turkey, must be able to trust an efficient, impartial and independent judicial system and we support any reform that works towards this end. We have also looked at the Kurdish question and we are clearly of the view that education in one’s native language is a perfectly satisfactory proposal to provide a response to the Kurdish question that is political and not merely for reasons of security. I think that these strong messages are all more credible when we do not hold back on our demands in the Council, particularly to ensure true consistency and to enable the European Union to finally recover its ability to pioneer reforms in Turkey and to use leverage to promote them. We are asking for all these measures to be taken with a view to opening chapters 23 and 24. Our demands are also clear in the case of visas: we need a roadmap for the liberalisation of visas, as this situation in a country in the process of accession to the European Union is quite unique, and therefore totally discriminatory. We want these essential messages to be heard in Turkey and I would not wish for the readership of this excellent report and its importance in relation to the current situation in Turkey to be diminished or detracted from by questionable statements. What is the purpose of the reference in this text to the secular integrity of the armed forces? We are delighted with the huge amount of work which has been achieved in Turkey over a number of years to ensure that the armed forces recover their place, under the control of the civil authorities, and for military expenditure to be brought under the oversight of the Court of Accounts. What is the purpose of this reference to the secular integrity of armed forces which have served NATO since 1952, which are one of its largest armed forces and the presence of which is being made conditional on this secular integrity? We know the nature of the armed forces of a secular, non-religious State. That is what we want for Turkey and I think that together we must delete those words. As for the Ergenekon trial, lastly, it is not credible to cast doubt on all cases in the Ergenekon trial as we know, and the European Court of Human Rights reiterated this in December in a judgment, there are perfectly well-founded cases where arrests on the basis of accusations of crimes or criminal acts have been judged to be well founded by the European Court of Human Rights. We cannot let ourselves be suspicious of and rule out all the cases involved in the Ergenekon trial. My opinion is this: if we remove these two references, we will have the widest possible readership, which is extremely important, in Turkey, in society as a whole, and in its entire political and social fields. (Applause) Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Madam President, I actually think that we are no longer talking here of repression or of an oppressed people, but of an intolerable terror, perpetrated by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. We only need to see how public hospitals have now been transformed into centres of torture, execution and kidnapping. Given that, I will not list the considerable number of people injured, the number of people who have disappeared, the number of detainees or the number of deaths. The UN Human Rights Council got it right when it said that we are dealing here with crimes against humanity. Ms De Keyser is right: Assad will have to account for his crimes before the International Criminal Court. In the face of this terror, I sincerely wish to salute the courage, determination and the incredible capacity for resistance shown by organised civil society in Syria as, despite everything, the food arrives, despite everything, information is exchanged, despite everything, protection is provided for those who demonstrate. Despite everything, medical care is provided in living rooms that have been transformed into emergency hospitals. I believe that the channels that are in place are precarious and dangerous. We should discuss and work to see how we might now intensify the movement of goods, care, food and protection via these informal channels, how we can make it secure, stronger and broader, how we can protect those who are risking their lives to move these goods. This, I feel, is the first way to give practical help, which is what we are calling for. Obviously, sanctions must be strengthened and it is necessary, above all, to ensure that they are implemented appropriately. I really do believe that the European Commission and the Council have to ask themselves how a boat laden with arms was able to sail to Syria from a Cypriot port to supply Bashar al-Assad with weapons that he is using against his own people. There is the Arab League initiative. Of course, it has to be supported, but vigilance is required too. We are well aware that the Arab League represents a set of extremely diverse interests. We are well aware that the initiatives there are proliferating before the Presidency of the Arab League is taken over by Iraq. All this is well known but, given the situation, the European Union must very clearly define its strategy and be able to deliver it on the 24th in Tunis. It is right that this meeting should take place in Tunis, because it is important. It shows that this story is, first and foremost, the story of a people at the mercy of its oppressor. We are looking at Syria as a piece on a complicated chessboard and, if we move that piece, we are wondering what the next moves might be. We have to come back to the base of the conflict, of this battle, to support the population. The story unfolding today in Syria is truly that of a society that is struggling for democracy and for rights. Without being naïve, we should see that as the main goal, towards which we should turn all of our efforts. As a result, the meeting on 24 February must allow us to isolate or bring on board those countries that currently support the Syrian regime. Of course, there is China and Russia, but there is also Algeria. We must apply maximum pressure to isolate Assad. That is one way to give practical help. We must also recognise the National Council. It has its faults, but we must maintain a political dialogue with it to help it to become the political interlocutor for the future Syria. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

 Mr President, I would like to stress the last point raised by Ms Schaake, because, indeed, not only is it a disgrace, it is also utterly ludicrous, that the European Union and its Council have not come up with the political means to invite Turkey to the table to discuss the situation in Syria. It is now clear that the future scenario called for by Ms De Keyser can only come about through dialogue between Turkey, in particular, the Arab League and the European Union. It is true that there is no written script, but, nevertheless, we do have some assurances. Firstly, Bashar al-Assad will fall. He will fall. That is the deeply-held belief that we all share and, at best, he will be handed over to the International Criminal Court. He will therefore fall. What this tells us is that civil society has an incredible capacity, not only to mobilise itself, but also to coordinate and organise itself, and to do so neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city, through a totally effective and impressive horizontal network. Just look at what they achieved with the first of six stages of the general strike in Syria, when they called on everyone not to go to the mosque, not to go shopping, to close shops early, to stay at home, not to make telephone calls, to carry out some form of civil disobedience. ‘Dead Syria’, just like the ‘dead city’ that is often referred to. We can see how impressive the organisation behind this is. What we have here is a population adopting the approach of civil disobedience and non-violent action. I do not really want to repeat what you have said regarding the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and which was picked up by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, but I do not get the feeling at all that we are now on the brink of civil war. What is certain is that growing numbers of soldiers, including those in the Free Syrian Army, are assuming the role of protectors of the people in coordination with local committees. It is absolutely essential that we offer our assistance in this very specific battle on the ground, which is being conducted in a non-violent manner with the Free Syrian Army offering defence and protection. This is where we must be effective, offering very simple but practical things: help with radios, communications, intelligence capabilities for the opposition, capabilities in the field of new technologies once sold to al-Assad, but which we must now supply to the opposition. These are the concrete steps that we can take to strengthen their operational capability and I think ... (The President cut off the speaker) Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), we focused instead on communications regarding the new partnership for mobility, for two reasons: because of the aspirations expressed, aspirations to rights, including, it would appear, the right to mobility, and also because, to date, our migration policy with these countries clearly rested in the iron fists of dictators who, I am glad to say, are no longer in place. We therefore take a very positive view of the partnership for mobility but would like to question the link still established between the readmission agreements, legal migration and the fight against illegal immigration, relying solely on the report prepared by the Commission itself on readmission agreements. The report says that implementation is inconsistent and not transparent, that the negotiating mandate is unrealistic, that there are serious risks of human right violations and that even this assessment acknowledges that visa liberalisation has no impact on illegal immigration. I therefore think that a little further reflection is needed and then, above all, we need to develop an approach with these countries that is fully rooted in the mutual benefits of mobility, establishing a structured dialogue. And when we talk about partnership with civil society, this means both mobility and other issues, it is critical that this partnership with civil society, which is the key to success, includes a concrete mechanism for consulting civil society at all stages, early on during the implementation and evaluation.

 Mr President, neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission, nor even the Council, I was going to say, have stood helplessly by in the face of the extremely serious discrimination suffered by the Roma. Parliament is well known for its resolutions on this subject. The European Commission set up a Roma Task Force and issued a Communication on the issue in April 2011, and the Council adopted a European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies for each Member State at the end of June. Nevertheless, I feel that this text certainly has inherent weaknesses, attention to which was drawn at the time. This weakness concerned the goals that were set concerning the fight against anti-Gypsyism and discrimination. Consequently, now, with just one month to go before Member States must submit their strategies to the European Commission, we have grave doubts about the efforts governments have made to include stakeholders, local and regional authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Roma populations themselves in drawing up their national strategies. Above all, however, I have the feeling that day after day, an extremely worrying situation is emerging from the press, from eye-witness accounts, from facts related by NGOs and from reports. They speak of violence and hateful anti-Roma demonstrations, attempts on their freedom of movement, segregation at school, forced expulsions, human trafficking, forced sterilisation of women, and of the way that anti-Roma rhetoric has become commonplace in political circles. Faced with this, I believe that our positive, inclusive agenda must categorically go hand in hand with the utmost vigilance and be rigorously enforced. I believe that the European Commission must use all the means at its disposal to be extremely strict towards Member States in its role as guardian of the acquis communautaire
 and of the Treaties. Let me quote you an example. The massive expulsions that took place in France have just been unambiguously condemned by the Council of Europe as ‘an aggravated violation of human rights’. In its defence, the French Government cited the decision of the European Commission, which, as the French Government saw it, found the evictions to be completely compatible with European law. I believe that Member States should no longer be able to resort to this type of argument and that the Commission must be extremely strict. As for us, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we too must do more. In addition to our extremely important work, we should set up a monitoring group to include members of national parliaments, in association with NGOs, so that we can in any case fight much more effectively against the discrimination suffered by the Roma.

The Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from voting on the 2012 budget at first reading on 26 October 2011. We deeply regret the creation of an envelope of EUR 200 000 ‘to fund pilot projects or other support activities aiming to analyse the public acceptance of the exploration for and exploitation of shale gas and introducing a dialogue on this matter’. We cannot accept that a single European cent be used to fund propaganda in favour of shale gas. Furthermore, this first post-Fukushima budget still grants a substantial allocation to the ITER nuclear reactor, which is an extravagant and pointless project, and a dead end in terms of energy and ecology. For these two reasons at least, we were not able to vote in favour of this draft budget, despite the fact that green pilot projects, an increase in financial assistance for Palestine and substantial savings in administrative costs have been adopted. We have therefore decided to abstain, particularly so as not to weaken Parliament’s position in the difficult negotiations now due to begin with the Council. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, I am not sorry that we are having this debate, because at the end of the day, there has not been any discussion of Turkish-Cypriot relations nor of the situation in Cyprus since 2004. So this is the first time since then that we have had an open discussion about a European Union Member State in which there has been a United Nations international peace-keeping mission since 1964 in relation to a conflict with a country engaged in the accession process. Stating the facts naturally highlights the fairly ludicrous nature of the situation. As far as I am concerned, this debate is not about whether Cyprus is exercising its sovereign right by deciding to drill in its exclusive economic zone. That is beyond doubt. International law clearly says that Cyprus is in the right, but equally we could envisage a situation whereby, under a future agreement, the benefits from that drilling would be shared fairly between the two communities. Having said that, I feel that the timing of the operation is reprehensible because, at the end of the day, this decision is prejudicial to the negotiations due to begin in the coming days under the aegis of the United Nations. In my view, the role of our Parliament – as has already been demonstrated – is not to engage in one-upmanship but rather to make a constructive contribution to achieving overall peace within the framework of an agreement for a federal country made up of two zones and two communities. What is more, the substance of a future agreement is known and almost – I nearly said for the most part – on the table. The question that we need to ask ourselves as Europeans is what Member States and the European Union are doing to bring a political agreement into the world and to encourage all the stakeholders to take constructive confidence building measures. However, sometimes I feel that the question of Cyprus is intentionally left to one side, to be used when the need arises in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey. I would like practical measures to be taken today by the Union and the Member States to support and encourage a rapid resolution to what is essentially a European problem. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, the Frontex Agency is an agency that has been untouched by the crisis, given that its budget has increased from just over EUR 6 million in 2005 to more than EUR 80 million today. In other words, Frontex has grown without facing any awkward questions for many years. Ultimately, the Member States saw something to be gained from this: firstly, the availability of resources for their own internal operations; secondly, the opportunity to turn to Frontex when faced with countries that were seen to be failing to control their borders; and thirdly, the increase in Frontex’s powers and resources, which everyone was calling for. This also enabled the Director of Frontex, only two years ago, to tell MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who were worried about human rights being violated, that it was not Frontex’s job to deal with that issue; it was the responsibility of the Member States! Frontex has ultimately grown against this backdrop of irresponsibility with regard to human rights. I think that, today, it is really to the credit of Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Busuttil, that the issue of fundamental rights protection was placed so high on the agenda of the negotiations. I say this, of course, because the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force and Frontex is now accountable for its actions to the Court of Justice, which is no small thing; and also because a number of reports show that the principle of non-refoulement has been violated several times during Frontex operations and that access to asylum application procedures, which is an inviolable and international right, has been somewhat mismanaged. We are also awaiting a report from Human Rights Watch, which will show that Frontex is responsible, to some extent, for the unfair detention of migrants. We therefore had a real problem with regard to respect for human rights, and I believe that the negotiations have enabled us to make serious progress in this area. Nevertheless, this does not mean that my group will be voting in favour of this mandate, because we believe that independence – as mentioned by Ms Lochbihler in particular – independent observation, and reliable, impartial and independent procedures for combating human rights violations, have not been established. This is what will ultimately lead my group to abstain. Moreover, I should like to take advantage of this debate in order to question the Commission and the Council on the results and the status of Operation Hermes, the most recent Frontex operation: boats, helicopters, 2 000 drowned in the Mediterranean since the NATO intervention in Libya. What did Frontex do during this time? I do not know. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, all these populations are putting a colossal amount of energy into overthrowing regimes that are enemies of freedom and are oppressing them. We cannot help but admire this energy, and it puts paid to the prejudices held in various quarters about the supposed backwardness of the Arab world. As has already been said, it requires a good deal of the European Union to rise to the challenge of these aspirations. For us to condemn the violence, support those who promote change, impose sanctions on the dictators, start again from scratch the deals we had negotiated with fallen powers, take on board the human, political and economic consequences of the upheaval that is going on, prevent counter-revolutionary attempts, mitigate the causes of destabilisation and rebuild our relationship as one of partnership, is a revolution in itself for the European Union. Who now seriously believes that Bashar al-Assad is capable of beginning a political process that would involve those who promote democracy and change, and would establish the rule of law? I certainly do not, and I do not think many people do. And yet, there is no appeal to President al-Assad to leave power in our resolution. Nor is there a majority, unless we see proof to the contrary, willing to call the atrocities committed by this regime against peaceful citizens crimes against humanity, which is what they are, and to bring a case before the International Criminal Court through a Security Council resolution. I do not think we have exhausted all the possibilities for diplomacy. Turkey could provide valuable help on this, if it can persuade the hesitant countries that have been mentioned, especially Russia and Brazil, but also China. Taking responsibility also means protecting. It means resettling refugees, activating temporary protection, rescuing people at sea. These are the concrete steps that the European Union should be proposing for refugees, instead of organising top-level crisis meetings to discuss EU law. If the EU wants to be consistent, it needs a system that will allow civil society to be involved at every stage in defining objectives and indicators and in implementing and evaluating the EU’s agreements with its future partners. This will represent real change for the European Union. Our partners are now accountable to their people, and their people are eagerly expressing their democratic demands. Baroness Ashton, you were correct in your intuition and your analysis, well before the revolutions began. At the beginning of your mandate, you said that the validity of the EU’s external policy would be tested in its own neighbourhood. How true that is! If the Union rises to the challenge of these peoples’ democratic aspirations, its role on the new world scene will no longer hang as a question mark over the suffering that is piling up. In the situation as it stands today, it is the status of the European Union in this 21st century world taking shape before our eyes that is at stake. Hélène Flautre,  
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

Mr President, it is very good news that populations are moving to reclaim their freedoms and rights, and to obtain a change of the political regime and more democracy. This is at the heart of the European Union’s foreign policy and of the European project. That can only evoke our enthusiasm and our support. The very bad news, however, is that these populations are suffering an extremely tough repression, demonstrating these values and aspirations while putting their lives at risk, and that is totally unacceptable. Thus, the imperative of protecting the populations, which has led to military action in Libya, must now take other forms to protect those who are demonstrating in these three countries. I think that the statements are extremely important – the legitimate statements, the aspirations held by these populations – but we also need action. As part of this action, we need an assurance that all those leaders responsible for using disproportionate force against their populations will not go unpunished. In order to do that, the diplomatic convocation and activation of the Member States of the United Nations Human Rights Council must be in full swing in order to get missions, reports and resolutions so that the politicians responsible get an assurance that these acts of violence will not remain unpunished. Finally, I think that we certainly do have methods for bypassing the ‘blackout’ of the press. Journalists, whether national or foreign, are facing considerable difficulties in documenting the situation. We know what to do; we have instruments for bypassing these obstacles. We absolutely must make use of them. Then, when we have the means to act, I think that we must find a way of using them. Clearly, this is not the time to chase the Syrian President to get his signature on a readmission agreement, which could, in any case, only be envisaged under certain conditions, including a very serious, effective and relevant programme, the implementation of reforms in Syria and the freeing of all prisoners of conscience and peaceful demonstrators, not just here, but also in the other two countries.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the popular movements in the Southern Mediterranean have clearly highlighted weaknesses in our European Neighbourhood Policy. As I see it, the problem lies not so much with the Neighbourhood Policy objectives, which are set out in Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty of Lisbon on promoting and respecting human rights and democracy – which are also social objectives – but rather in our flawed implementation of those objectives. Consequently, we need to learn lessons for the future. This is what is being done in the current work on reviewing the policy. The first issue, which was raised by Mr Schulz, is our ability to provide real and effective support for civil society in all neighbouring countries, irrespective of their importance in terms of trade or strategy, or their political situation. When neighbouring countries are in a state of transition, this is extremely useful and necessary. It is also undeniably easier than when they are labouring under the yoke of an authoritarian regime, as is the case in Syria, but this is a challenge, an issue, that we need to learn to address effectively. I believe that we will also need to learn to discuss these matters with our partners, not only in forums dedicated to human rights, such as sub-committees, but also at the highest political level. Yet, at the same time, we must ensure that sub-committee agendas do not become disconnected from the situation, as has happened in the past, or fail to feed into other bodies, such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA). I support the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which I believe is pivotal. It seems to me that we should also add a separate target for social justice and combating inequalities. Naturally, we will also need to rethink our understanding of mobility in the Mediterranean region. I think that the mobility partnership is a positive feature, but we will also need to learn how to promote the benefits of this mobility for individuals who travel between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and for both the host nation and the country of origin. We will also need to factor these changing movements into basic rights for those who cross the Mediterranean and settle in Europe. Hélène Flautre,

 Madam President, it is of course good news that we now have a concrete European framework that is going to place an obligation on every Member State to present its national Roma integration strategy. Between now and the end of the year, the Commission will assess these strategies and then in roughly one year’s time we will need to debate the issue again. Today, we are therefore in effect setting out a road map which should allow parliamentarians, public bodies and civil society to exercise ongoing, extreme vigilance in the very important areas you have mentioned. I note that the Commission communication takes on board some of the points we set out in the parliamentary report. I am talking for instance about the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency in the assessment of the strategies. I believe the Agency has proven its competence in this area. I am also talking about developing cooperation with the Council of Europe on training mediators from the Roma community. This is an important strategic factor for the success of the projects at all levels, as is the attention devoted to Roma who are nationals of third countries and the enlargement aspect, which is taken into consideration in this report. Lastly, I think that establishing common indicators to support the monitoring system is very much to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I must emphasise certain failings in this communication. I believe it is not sufficiently strong and insistent in its reference to the necessary participation of Roma at all levels, that is to say at the levels of preparing the projects, implementing the projects and evaluating them. The communication talks about information and consultation, but the involvement of the Roma community itself is vital. There is ample experience to prove this, because there have actually been good experiences in Europe as well. I find this a weakness in the communication. A second weakness in the communication is that it deals with the issue of non-discrimination as a cross-cutting theme in each of the four areas. However, I think it is very important, or would have been very important, to have a special paragraph devoted to combating discrimination and violence and to access to justice for the Roma. This anti-discrimination, fundamental rights, access to justice component is not included as a specific component in its own right. I find this another weakness in the Commission document. I think we also talked about the subject of mediators, a programme that was launched by the Council of Europe. It is good that it is mentioned in this communication. We could have mentioned, and you also could have mentioned the guidelines that have already been drawn up by the Council of Europe, so that we do not somehow end up with two strategies, or two types of framework for assessing the national strategies. I feel this would have been a plus in this communication. Finally, I think that the Commission’s work is not yet finished, and that the task force should continue its work, in order to ensure that Member States are constantly aware of the pressure on them from the Commission, civil society and local bodies to actually implement these guidelines.

 Mr President, the work that has been undertaken here on this report, under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume, is very important. As Mrs Malmström said, it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system, and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system. One ought, in fact, to call it an abyss, an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking. When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1-65%, when we have, in a State such as France for example, 75% of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal, when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect, we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission – and which is strengthened by the high quality report drafted under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume – namely, to improve the quality of decision making at first instance, is absolutely crucial. As I understand it, the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying, and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers. It should be remembered that Cyprus, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population. Let us listen to those States too, then, because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, I do not think that we can welcome the revolution in Tunisia, on the one hand, and demand that the country implements the border control policy that existed in the days of the Ben Ali dictatorship, on the other. I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government, which has many other matters to attend to: its own refugees – as has been said – and overseeing its democratic transition process. The situation, then, is a new and exceptional one, and this should perhaps enable us to think up appropriate solutions while at the same time showing solidarity. Baroness Ludford is right – that is what is definitely lacking the most within the European Union. I think that the work of the European Commission, and of Parliament, could consist firstly in declaring a moratorium on the return of Tunisians, because that really is improper and inappropriate. We should also grant exceptional permission to reside to Tunisians who have already arrived in France and Italy, guarantee access to Europe to people seeking protection, and refrain from taking any steps or concluding any agreements that might get in the way of that protection, apply the provisions – as has been said – of the 2001 directive to all those eligible to take advantage of them, and accommodate refugees present at the border between Tunisia and Libya as part of the resettlement process. Next, I believe that we must think about forging cooperative links with these future fully democratic countries, so that Tunisians can come and work, study and travel perfectly legally, so as to create real channels of mobility between the two shores of the Mediterranean.

 Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work in providing rigorously detailed documentation and in drawing up a report in the utmost good faith with the aim of sending clear political messages, particularly on the eve of the legislative elections in Turkey, and I endorse this work. This report – unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable – stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution. However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors? There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations – in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 – and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner. Now, everyone can see that it is not. We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition. I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey’s accession. I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation. Today, this is very clearly in question. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, unfortunately, every day in the press, we read accounts of discriminative or racist acts against the Roma. Therefore, this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves, of course, and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union’s fundamental values. The Commission will therefore have to develop a framework, a European strategy, for the national action plans. Its responsibility will extend far beyond the development of this European framework for the national action plans, because the Member States will make progress on this subject only if they are given a strong incentive by the Commission to commit themselves to it. This will require – as the report explains very well – an extremely precise evaluation of the results obtained, with the use of benchmark criteria and indicators. It will also require the involvement of all interested parties and Roma communities in the first instance. I believe that it is very important to make the connection with the Council of Europe’s programme on the training of Roma mediators. This is an essential condition if the inclusion projects are to be crowned with success at regional level. Next, the European Commission also needs to get involved through its own projects, run by itself, pilot projects – that is what this report proposes – which could be run, for example, in the micro-regions that we have spoken about, so that exemplary, remarkable projects can convince all interested parties to become involved in this inclusion process. I believe, then, that the European Commission should also be able to use its right to officially complain when the values, European legislation and national action plans are not as they should be, bearing in mind equal access to all rights, non-discrimination and freedom of movement. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Gomes for giving us the chance to debate a mandate for negotiations that is certainly thorny, as is the content of the negotiations themselves. The Tunisian example should serve as a warning that we need to proceed very cautiously, especially in the way in which we report on the negotiations. We cannot simply notch up successes as we go through the negotiations and celebrate because a regime such as the Gaddafi regime may have agreed to certain human rights references, for example, because that regime is well-known for its major violations of all fundamental rights. What is more, all the migrants who arrive on our shores, though they are increasingly fewer in number, say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to Libya, because of the rapes, torture, abuse, forced repatriations, mass expulsions and racist acts. It has already been said, and I will repeat it: the list of serious, mass human rights abuses of migrants in Libya is long. So yes, of course, I think it is absolutely urgent that we do everything in our power to improve these people’s situation. This is a job for the High Commissioner for Refugees, and it is our task to resettle the individuals identified by the HCR. It is also a job for community-based organisations, which, at the moment, are extremely thin on the ground and need to be strengthened by all means possible. I believe that, if we truly want to abide by the goals we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties, we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants staying illegally in the EU back to Libya.

 Mr President, I think the aim of this discussion is to get the Council to finally show its hand, because I have to say that given such an ambitious, not to mention necessary, reform package on asylum, it is unbelievable that all we are getting are snippets of information, some contradictory, as to what is holding the Council up on these proposals that have been on the table for a long time now. We are getting a vague idea that the Council or the Member States may be stalling because of costs, but it is not even clear what is meant by this. Are they talking about human costs, political costs or financial costs? These different costs are sometimes linked in any case. One thing is for certain: there are instances of unsatisfactory practices and inadequate protection in Europe at the moment. In the first place, it is not true that Europe shoulders all the world’s problems. For example, in 2007, I think Europe took in only 14% of the world’s refugees. In the second place, some of the existing practices are utterly unacceptable. I am thinking of instances such as phallometric testing in the Czech Republic, right here in Europe, or the documents of the Committee against Torture, which brought to light many cases such as forced repatriation without the right to appeal or based on hurried-through procedures. I think we can certainly talk about costs: for example, we could talk about the cost of expelling migrants, which is very costly: the French Senate says that it costs EUR 20 000 per person expelled. Above all, we can talk about how we might improve the situation. There are certainly questions to be asked as to how we can improve the first-instance decision-making process, as Mrs Guillaume has done in her report, when roughly 50% of first-instance decisions are overturned on appeal. There are clearly very substantial economies to be made in terms of financial, human and political costs. We might take another look at the aberrations of the Dublin Convention, and I think the Council should look very carefully at these, because they also represent very substantial costs both in human and in financial terms. Lastly, and I will end here, one thing that is very expensive is detention, as the Parliamentary study confirms. The cost of detaining asylum seekers is prohibitive. This needs to be said, people need to be told and it needs to be discussed in the Council. This is absolutely urgent. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, this is a very good report, and the first one after the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Gál, for her hard work, receptiveness and fruitful cooperation. I would like to come back to four messages contained in this report. The first concerns our requirement for the Commission to fulfil its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The situation of the Roma people has sadly been the first practical case, and the Commission has, in the end, only gone halfway on this matter, basing itself solely on the Free Movement Directive. The Commission has sidestepped the non-discrimination issue on the basis of Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it cannot be so half-hearted in future, with the ratification, by the Union, of the European Convention on Human Rights, and I am delighted to see the Union’s commitment to seeing this through. The added value of this report also resides in the fact that it emphasises the need for early detection of potential violations through the implementation of a warning system. This system makes provision, among other things, for measures suspected of constituting such violations to be suspended while the accelerated procedure for determining whether they are contrary to fundamental rights is carried out. I would also insist on the need to set up a prevention system on the model, for example, of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism within the United Nations Council. Once again, I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes, as you have already mentioned, Mrs Reding. In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge. We are blindly endorsing these agreements when the actual terms of their implementation are being decided in joint committees from which Parliament is excluded. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE
).

Madam President, it has to be said that it is extremely odd to begin a directive which is intended to guarantee a legal framework for proper access to rights for all workers with a long list of the categories of workers excluded from that directive. That makes it seem like a project for legal migration but also for a multi-layered European labour market, where each category of workers would be assigned, according to their worth, a sort of portfolio of rights. We are therefore a long way from a horizontal and universal approach to workers’ rights. I think that those responsible in Europe have still not understood that more rights for workers means greater economic efficiency and greater social cohesion, with greater individual and collective benefits, of course, for migrants, for the host societies and for the societies of origin. Indeed, this has been shown in a study by the London School of Economics which says that regularising 600 000 irregular workers in Great Britain, who will not have access to this single application procedure, would bring GBP 3 billion into Great Britain’s coffers. We are not, I think, at all equal to the challenges. Hélène Flautre,

 Good evening Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Reding, you are quite rightly delighted today that France has responded to the European Commission's infringement proceedings at the eleventh hour and has provided a legislative programme for establishing procedural rights as required under the directive on the freedom of movement. According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice – as opposed to cancelled. We have taken note of your comments but as Members of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments. That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French authorities. However, let us not forget that you also asked France about individuals who have been escorted to the border and required to leave the country, an enquiry intended to confirm that these administrative procedures were not discriminatory. What has happened to those enquiries? Have you received a response? Just as the press revealed information about the villainous and discriminatory August circular, information was recently published about a file – a database – which contains personal information including details of ethnic or racial origin. Has this new twist not dented your confidence in the promises made by the French authorities and the accuracy of the information provided? Mrs Reding, would you not agree that the logical next step is now to tell us the current state of play in the ongoing examination of the documents requested by the Commission, both on the alleged discriminatory practices in France, but also regarding the potential infringement of data protection standards as laid down in Community law? I think that today’s European citizens are entitled to demand a responsible Commission which may publicise its successes but will also be determined in persevering with proceedings against the French authorities. After all, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which, it is widely recognised, have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma. I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data, in which the subjects are described as Gyppos, Gypsies or Roma.

 Madam President, I actually find our rapporteur very unwise in asking us MEPs to ratify and approve an agreement which really is highly problematic. First of all, it concerns Pakistan, which is not just any old country. Pakistan already admits more refugees than any other country in the world. And what are we mainly going to ask it to do? Readmit Pakistanis, of course, but also the Afghans who are here in Europe fleeing a war that we are waging in Afghanistan. I think we are starting to border on something like indecency here. It is a fact that Pakistan has not ratified the Geneva Convention, and it is a fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe asks us to ratify readmission agreements only with countries that offer a number of guarantees in terms of the right of asylum and international protection, which is not the case in Pakistan. Furthermore, there is a huge number of questions. If I had to say ‘Yes’ tomorrow, I do not even know what I am saying ‘Yes’ to. If you look closely at these various articles, the impact of this article may be anything from 20, may be anything from 100 to 20 000, and perhaps more. Why? Because nobody is saying what the responses will be to everything that is decided in the Readmission Committee. Who is responsible for proving that an individual arrived after the agreement had been ratified? Who will be responsible for proving that that individual arrived in the EU directly from Pakistan? What is going to happen at the end of the thirty day period if Pakistan does not respond and does not issue travel documents? Are we, as Members of the Commission suggest, going to accept this strange EU ‘pass’ instrument? I do not have any answers, and neither do you, Mrs Malmström; I know that you will be unable to provide me with any answers. I asked the Pakistani Ambassador, and he does not have any answers. All of that will be buried in the Readmission Committee. As we are incapable of saying what the actual impact of this agreement will be, I cannot say that I accept it. Everything depends on the answers provided to these questions. I think that we should say ‘No’ tomorrow. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, Mrs Reding, I must say that I fully share the consternation of Mr Swoboda and Mrs Weber. It is quite astounding that, after the various meetings you have been able to have and the documents you have received, you are still at this stage in acknowledging, or rather failing to acknowledge, the clear breaches that the French Government has committed in expelling the Roma. And this is not a new topic: a year ago, a group of voluntary organisations petitioned you on matters that are being raised again today, such as the failure to abide by the one month’s notice period before sending back European citizens that is enshrined in the Free Movement Directive. As regards the right to a personal examination of circumstances, I do not think you need any further expert opinions to conclude that when ‘escort to the border’ orders are handed out en masse
 in a camp, all identically addressed, this goes against the consideration of personal situations. Are six-year-old children a threat to public order? Do you really need additional proof, when justice and the French courts have judged this case and the French Government is using an extremely broad and illegitimate interpretation of a public order threat? If you need judges, experts or NGOs, we can provide you with them. However, please stop this denial of reality and this failure to fulfil your duties! The debate that took place this morning was a disgrace. We heard the leader of the European Parliament’s largest political group talking about the Roma people in connection with thefts of tractors in his local area. We heard José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, speaking during the debate on the Roma people about the security needs of European citizens. In other words, at the highest level of Europe’s political leaders, the tendency to automatically associate the Roma with crime, prostitution and trafficking is being boosted and fed. In doing so, they are placing fundamental rights and the whole point of Europe itself at stake. As Mr Cohn-Bendit said this morning: this is a test of you, Mrs Reding; this is a test of the Treaty of Lisbon, a test of your relevance. Will you be capable of proving, in this situation, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is anything other than a sham? It is down to you, it is your duty, and now is the time to proclaim this.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs in ’t Veld for her speech. At the very least, it clearly explains the reasons for her vote in favour, because from the start, in the speeches from the two large groups, I have not heard anything but smokescreens. The reality is that this agreement is not obviously any different, at least on the main points which motivated the opposition of the European Parliament in February. There are still cases of haphazard data transfer, and there is still the retention of data for five years. There is still effectively no right of recourse for European citizens on American territory, and there is the very important question raised by Mr Tavares concerning Europol. Europol is not a judicial institution, and it is not me who says that – it is the texts, the treaties. The European and national data protection supervisors are all in agreement on these essential points. As for me, I have the feeling that after having flexed our muscles – as you said, Mr De Clerck – we are now kowtowing, and this is not good news for European citizens. (Applause) Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the nine victims of the Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla, who were riddled with dozens of bullets, mostly at point-blank range and mostly in the back, could have been one of 42 nationalities, but they are nine Turkish victims. We can clearly imagine the mobilisation of the government in Turkey and the agitation of public opinion. Moreover, in the light of the actions, reactions and the pressure that Mr Erdoğan’s government is putting on the Israeli Government, today some would have us believe that this is a Turkish-Israeli issue and that it is nonetheless ultimate proof that Turkey has decided to turn its back on Europe and proof of its new foreign policy axis. Madam High Representative, I really would like you to clear up any ambiguity on this subject. It must be said loud and clear that it is a very good thing that Mr Erdoğan is being applauded by Arab public opinion because Mr Erdoğan is proving that using political instruments to act is more effective than violence and more effective than radicalism and extremism. I believe that this is a political lesson that we could encourage and support, and I call on you, Madam High Representative, to state this loud and clear. Hélène Flautre,

Madam President, I would have preferred to hear from the rapporteur, Mr Tavares, but never mind; now he has finally joined us in this debate, and that is the main thing. I think that the work that he has managed to do to reach a consensus on the use of the European Refugee Fund, whose job it is to fund and encourage the Member States to develop their refugee resettlement programme, is exceptionally positive work, which Commissioner Malmström is strongly encouraging, and I am delighted to see that. We must nevertheless bear in mind a few figures, which will allow us to put the scope of this fund into perspective. If we were to allocate the entire European Refugee Fund – something that I do not want because it would inevitably be detrimental to the funding of the conditions of reception of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe – we would barely be able to resettle 20 000 refugees in Europe, a number far removed from the request of the UNHCR, which has established that there are more than 470 000 refugees worldwide in need of resettlement, that is, people who genuinely have specific needs, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and who cannot possibly return to their country of origin. We must therefore be sensible. To me, the second precaution we must take – because we have experienced this in my country, France – concerns the media coverage of the resettlement of some refugees as a tree of charity hiding a forest of malpractice, because at the same time, this country, France, has just been condemned by the United Nations Committee against Torture for returning asylum seekers to third countries where they risk facing inhumane or degrading treatment. I believe – and this is my final point – that these are the precautions that we must bear in mind. Hélène Flautre,

 Mr President, the Agency for Fundamental Rights reports that the Roma suffer every type of discrimination in every area, whether it be in relation to access to employment, to health care, to education or to housing. They are therefore the minority that is most discriminated against in Europe. In 2009, for example, on average, one in every four Roma was a victim of a crime against the person – specifically assaults, threats and serious harassment – on at least one occasion in the course of the previous 12 months whilst, at the same time, one in every three Roma was questioned by the police on average four times in the course of the previous 12 months. Their marginalised situation is compounded by their lack of awareness of their rights. This situation, which affects almost 10 million people at the heart of the European Union, which is now endowed with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and will soon be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, casts serious doubts over the policy of non-discrimination and effectiveness of rights, both at EU and Member State level. It took the racist violence in Italy in December 2007 to have a large-scale, high-level European mobilisation finally result in the organisation of the first European summit in September 2008. However, the call for a European Union framework strategy on the integration of the Roma, including a directive on the inclusion of the Roma, has still not seen the light of day. Member States – such as France and some others too – that maintain temporary measures for access to their markets for Bulgarians and Romanians are primarily penalising the Roma and must remove those measures as soon as possible as a sign of political goodwill. Member States must finally abandon the negotiation of bilateral readmission agreements with Kosovo, which are leading to Roma being returned to lead-contaminated camps in northern Mitrovica, as Mr Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, has been able to demonstrate. As regards the European Commission, I wish to remind it of the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2009 on the social situation of the Roma. In this year for combating poverty, I believe that we can at last decide to make the best use of our instruments and our Structural Funds with a view to resolving this serious situation.

 Mr President, firstly, I should like to welcome and congratulate Commissioner Füle. The 12th hearing of the trial of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink was held in Istanbul on Monday. For the first time, official observers at that trial felt that the court was sincerely trying to establish the truth and that the connections between this trial – that of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink – and other trials under way – such as that of the Ergenekon network – had been highlighted by the prosecutor. This fact is extremely significant because it is every political assassination, intolerance within society and the impunity that still prevails that are being put on trial here. Moreover, this is a view that the families of the victims of these political assassinations eloquently expressed when, referring to the Turkish ‘Deep State’, they declared themselves to be Hrant Dink’s ‘deep family’. I am telling you this because things are moving forward and because, within Turkish civil society, there is a desire and a movement for reform aimed at promoting democracy and rights, and this desire and this movement are exceptionally powerful. I should also like to cite another example which is making the headlines in the newspapers at the moment –family honour crimes have already been mentioned – and that is the young 16-year-old girl who was found buried in a chicken pen and who had been sentenced by the family council for having spoken to boys. This is terrifying and it is a crime. The members of that family will obviously have to be put in prison. The fact is, a few years ago, these crimes did not make the headlines. It is therefore pleasing today to see that these so-called ‘honour crimes’, which are simply barbaric crimes, are no longer being tolerated in Turkish society. Turkish society is in a state of flux, it is in turmoil even, and I think that, when we discuss Turkey, we must be keenly aware that any reform in that country deeply affects relations between citizens, the establishment, Turkish history and democracy. These are absolutely crucial elements. I believe that our process must be totally sincere. Today, the sincerity of our process is acknowledged, and it matches our ability to support the complicated, critical and historic process in Cyprus. Today, the EU must say clearly to Cyprus that we are ready to support and to guarantee, using all the means at our disposal, economic and financial means included, any agreement reached between the north and the south and that we are also determined to ensure that nothing in the body of EU law can hinder the achievement of a consensus in Cyprus. We must forge ahead; the future of Turkey’s membership of the EU is also riding on this issue. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Madam President, a question, yes, but which question? Addressed to whom and for what purpose? I believe that our delegation – of which you are a member, Mr Madlener – has committed itself and continues to firmly commit itself to human rights and gender equality and to every initiative taken to counter violence against women. I mentioned this just now in my speech. I believe that so-called honour crimes, which are crimes organised on a family or tribal basis, are utterly indefensible and that, today, it is very pleasing to see that no one in Turkey puts up with this type of archaic criminal practice any more. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Madam President, I, too, hope that everything is done at European level to encourage the Member States to assume their responsibilities and accommodate those Guantánamo detainees who have been proven innocent. They are victims and must be accommodated safely on European soil. Everyone knows, however, that the closure of Guantánamo will not stop questions being asked about human rights and counterterrorism, either in the United States or in Europe. In the United States, as you said, the antiterrorism law still permits unlimited pre-trial detention and trials before military courts. In Europe, well, the Guantánamo prisoners did not just fall out of the sky. I genuinely believe that there has been a failure to shed light on this subject. Mrs Hautala rightly spoke of the parliamentary investigation concluded on 22 December by Lithuania. It should be praised to the skies. It is exemplary. It must serve as an example. Conclusions were not drawn from these illegal practices on European soil, and I believe that that is the job of the European Commission; that is the job of the Council. We must draw every possible conclusion from the illegal practices which took place and which led to the opening of Guantánamo, a decision in which the Member States were fully complicit.

Mr President, I am disturbed by the speeches that I have just heard, from the Commissioner right through to my fellow Members. I feel that we really have our work cut out to gain an accurate and objective understanding of the present situation in Tunisia. Frankly, when I listen to you, I feel as though I am listening to western intellectuals talking cheerfully, many decades ago, about the economic and social success in the countries of the USSR, with a complete inability to go and see what our shared values stand for in practice in those countries. What are our shared values, Mr Michel? They are human rights, democracy and the rule of law. You have all rightly pointed out that Tunisia was our first partner to sign an association agreement. This is true, and that is why all this is very worrying, because we are not talking here about gaps, Commissioner, or about small steps. No. There is a huge, ongoing decline in human rights and democracy in Tunisia. Can you name one single newspaper, party or union that has been authorised in the last 20 years? No. The truth is that fundamental freedoms are being systematically and utterly disregarded, and, with them, our own commitments. This is not about moralising; this is about respecting the values of the European Union, and respecting the commitments that we made by signing this association agreement. Therefore, I demand that there be at least a shared analysis of this matter. I believe that we have worked hard to have this debate, but it would certainly be time better spent if we were to organise an actual delegation, one that really goes and meets this civil society in Tunisia and the various members of that society, in order to make an assessment of the continued harassment experienced by human rights defenders, students, trade unionists, workers and lawyers. There have been putsches in almost all of the associations that showed a certain degree of autonomy with regard to the authorities. I therefore believe that you are completely deluded on this matter. Having listened to your speeches, I well understand why you do not want to see the real picture in Tunisia. You do not want to see it because you believe that there are economic interests at stake, and because you believe that there are interests at stake relating to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration. You have expressed all this in the clearest of terms, and you go on about advances relating to equality between men and women and to the family, advances that date back to Bourguiba’s time. I repeat, these date back to Bourguiba. There has been no further progress since that time. I therefore believe that, if we have any respect for ourselves, for the agreements we sign, for the Neighbourhood Policy or for EU values, we certainly cannot propose an advanced status for Tunisia. Therefore, I tell you straight: if you propose that and renounce all requirements and all commitments in relation to human rights and democracy with all the countries of the Mediterranean, that will be the guaranteed outcome.

 Madam President, Commissioner Rehn, thank you for remaining with us at this late hour to discuss democratisation in Turkey, a subject on which you have done a great deal of work, for which I thank you. I believe that there were very many of us who, when the government announced its democratic initiative, its democratic opening-up, recognised just how bold a step this was and, at the same time, believed that this huge ambition represented a long road ahead, a road that would probably be full of pitfalls; the pitfalls appeared fairly quickly. The first act, as you said, was the dissolution of the DTP, but I also note that, alongside the ban on the DTP, the ban on engaging in political activity, which affects several elected members of its party, also eliminates the figures who were most heavily involved in the democratic and political dialogue to resolve the Kurdish issue. This leaves a question mark hanging over this decision. Next, there is also this wave of arrests which, today, are genuinely removing political leaders and therefore also the spokesmen on this Kurdish issue. Yet the Kurdish issue is central to the democratisation process in Turkey! Primarily because it is systemic, because it represents many years of suffering, violence, conflict and war, the tragic scars of which are still in evidence today; and these scars are also economic, social, cultural and political. This Kurdish issue is also placing a huge strain on the democratisation process. It is placing a strain on freedom of expression, on freedom of the press, on the rights of citizens and on the fight against torture. And when I see today how anti-terrorism legislation is being used as a cover for political reprisals, I say that now really is the time when we have to support the government and expect it to take another extremely ambitious initiative to emerge from this situation because, as we know, not all the established groups in Turkey are interested in a democratic settlement of the Kurdish issue. We are well aware of this fact, as we have been since the beginning. Therefore, Turkey now needs our support, our unfailing support in this process of democratisation. My fellow Member, Mrs in ’t Veld, is right to say that this unfailing support must include the renewal of that promise of membership once the democratisation process has been completed; it is absolutely crucial to say this. Next, the government will eventually have to produce reforms, which will inevitably have to lead to a new draft constitution. Immediate reforms will obviously relate to legislation on political parties. They will also relate to electoral reform – as a matter of extreme urgency – and to the independence of the judicial system. These fundamental pillars for a democratic state in Turkey must now be courageously and determinedly promoted by the Turkish Government. Moreover, this government must also implement initiatives to encourage consensus and reconciliation, because polarisation of society and of the political forces in Turkey would have a disastrous effect on the search for the consensus needed for the adoption of a new constitution, which we are all hoping for.

Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Malmström and the Swedish Presidency on their excellent conclusions. They revive the expectation that we all had, namely that it would be confirmed that the EU is indeed responsible for peace in the region under international law, and that, I believe, is crucial. Nevertheless, I am surprised that, one year after the military invasion of Gaza, no reference has been made, in these conclusions, to the follow-up to the Goldstone report sought by the Council. What stage are we at in the follow-up to this Goldstone report, to which the Council committed itself, notably with regard to the internal investigations involving the various parties concerned? Next, I am delighted that East Jerusalem is being considered as the capital of the future Palestinian State, or the Jerusalem of the two States. Nevertheless, these conclusions lack specific operational options. On the other hand, there are very many such options in the mission report by the Heads of State or Government who visited East Jerusalem. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to kindly clarify for us the specific methods by which, in fact, the European Union will neither recognise nor legitimise the annexation of East Jerusalem that Israel is currently seeking to achieve by, among other things, introducing economic measures, but also by orchestrating the mass displacement of Palestinian communities.

Mr President, I am talking here about so-called targeted sanctions, about intelligent sanctions, those that have a direct impact on fundamental rights too – the fundamental rights of individuals, organisations or legal bodies of any kind. These fundamental rights are important. They can include, for example, freedom of movement, but also protection of property. It is for these reasons that these targeted sanctions must comply with a number of minimum rules in terms of procedure and legal certainty. I would add, moreover, that respect for these legal and procedural rules is crucial if these targeted sanctions are to be credible and, therefore, effective. It was the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe – we in this House remember – that, through one of its then Members, Dick Marty, demanded transparency and the right of defence and which showed the absurdity of this lack of transparency where the effectiveness of listing and delisting was concerned. Listing and delisting were liable to affect innocent people too, people who were unaware of what was going on around them and unable to do anything about a situation that they generally stumbled upon by accident. That is why access to data, as mentioned by Mr Michel, communication of the grounds for listing, and protection in the transfer of personal data, are crucial elements of this procedure. Moving on, it nevertheless took a great deal of perseverance on the part of the victims of the United Nations’ and the European Union’s system of sanctions and the mobilisation of civil society, human rights organisations and also the European Parliament to have these victims’ rights recognised by the European Court of Justice. I would add that the Council’s amendments concerning blacklists depend on the proposals that have been made, including by the European Parliament. That is why the European Parliament absolutely must be involved in taking, implementing and monitoring these decisions, since history shows that it was the European Parliament that made the reform of the Council regulation possible.

 Mr President, the following is an extract from a letter written by William Bourdon, Taoufik Ben Brik’s lawyer, to Mr Sarkozy, President of the French Republic: ‘I have had the opportunity to denounce, as all his Tunisian lawyers have done, the legal farce which has resulted in Taoufik Ben Brik being sentenced, without in-depth examination, to a staggering six months in prison. I can unequivocally and formally attest to the fact that the dossier of the proceedings which led to this conviction was totally fabricated and was based on the personal vendetta of President Ben Ali. Throughout this year, 2009, he has been unable to travel since the fragility of his immune system is such that he is always at risk of being exposed to serious diseases. I believe that his family have succeeded in bringing him essential medicine, but I am not certain of this. His Tunisian lawyers have only intermittent access to their client, and some are systematically denied any possibility of visiting him. The only time that his wife has been able to see him was for a few minutes a few days ago, and she has been unable to see him again since.’ Mr President, please write to the Tunisian authorities to request the release of Taoufik Ben Brik.

Mr President, I agree, and so does my group, that the European Union’s enlargement policy is one of its most productive and most convincing policies. That is why, Mr Rehn, I am a little concerned for your future, because I am not entirely sure how you are going to be able to find a portfolio within the future Commission that is more attractive than that of enlargement. It is absolutely astounding to see what the prospect of membership can bring about as a force for change, for democracy-building, in a country such as Turkey. Yes, of course, there are still many things to achieve: the independence of the judiciary, a role for the army, freedom of expression, that all aspects of the Kurdish issue are genuinely dealt with once and for all, of course. However, I feel it is important to emphasise that this EU enlargement strategy is not just for the benefit of the countries that are going through the accession process; it is for our benefit and for the benefit of our European decision makers, too. It is irresponsible to diminish the efforts to change of a country such as Turkey by allowing doubts to remain about the outcome of the negotiation process. Yes, the outcome of the negotiation process will be that Turkey joins, and we must say so clearly. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that we are having a debate today on this issue because it is clear that the Heads of State or Government had expected the deportation of irregular migrants from the European Union to Afghanistan to be carried out without any fuss, and that is not the case. It is not the case for two reasons: firstly, because the European Commission has requested information from the United Kingdom Government and the French Government, which is a good thing, and, secondly, because we are having a debate on this subject today. Questions have already been asked. Is Afghanistan a safe country? Well, we should ask Mr Obama that, as he has just decided to send 34 000 soldiers there. No army is able to guarantee the survival of its men in Afghanistan, and are we supposed to be able to guarantee that the lives of the migrants that we send back to that country will not be endangered? This situation is a joke, and the UNHCR is not putting up with it either, as it has warmly recommended to the Member States that they do not proceed with deportations of this kind. Secondly, there is ambiguity surrounding collective expulsions. Everyone – and I most of all – welcomes the future binding character of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 19(1): ‘Collective expulsions are prohibited’. You tell us that this is not a collective expulsion. Mr Billström has a charming way of putting it, since he tells us that this is a reasonable mobilisation of resources. Soon, common charter flights are going to be sold to us in the same way as car pooling to combat global warming is. There are limits! And what are those limits? Well, I can tell you, as an elected representative from Pas-de-Calais, where there are many Afghans – who have given rise, moreover, to these deportations organised by Mr Besson in France – that, when the French Government decides, for communication purposes, to organise a collective return operation and to turn it into a media event, there are arrests in Pas-de-Calais: collective arrests, which are therefore illegal because they are discriminatory. Therefore, we absolutely cannot guarantee what you are saying, Mr Barrot, namely, that this is a joint operation for people who, following individual assessments, have been found to be irregular migrants. This is indeed a case of collective expulsion because there was a collective arrest. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, on Thursday, I was in Tunis for the trial of the poet and writer Taoufik Ben Brik, indicted in Tunisia on obscure common-law charges that fool no one. Since the ‘elections’ in Tunisia, held on 25 October, those who defend human rights have been subjected to an outburst of violence and harassment on such a scale as I have never before witnessed, familiar though I am with that country. On 25 October, President Ben Ali no doubt realised the full extent of the Tunisian people’s disaffection with their leader; and the embassies and the European Commission, which unfortunately does not have the political visa to attend this kind of trial, have displayed a general lack of interest in the issue that is unfolding. I think we must be very clear today. We are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue. What is stopping the embassies and the European Commission from rigorously questioning Mr Ben Ali – in the name of our binding agreements and mutual commitments with Tunisia – about his actions, which are entirely contrary to those commitments?

Mr President, something very simple is going to happen for our European Parliament with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon; we are going to have another 18 MEPs from 12 Member States of the European Union. We have been prudent because, in March of this year, the European Parliament asked all the Member States to anticipate this result by stating, as the method of appointment, that the elections on 7 June would be the democratic basis for sending these additional eighteen MEPs. Some Member States did so, like Spain and your country, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Other countries, which nonetheless state that they are very content, as am I, with the result of the Irish referendum and are keen to see the Treaty of Lisbon implemented, have still not done their duty, as far as their own will is concerned, by stating their method of appointment. Can we count on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to ask each Member State at the European Council on 29 and 30 October to state the method of appointment of these additional MEPs under the Treaty of Lisbon? The second thing that really shocks me is that everyone is talking about the grand ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it imposes an obligation on us in connection with one very simple thing: equality between men and women. This is a binding objective of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the Treaty of Lisbon. I understand that, for the additional two posts which remain to be filled, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and the President of the Council, only men’s names are being circulated. Your country, Sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question. I expect you to take this extremely seriously. It is not possible for us to only have men in the four major positions of responsibility in Europe. It is not worthy of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not worthy of Europe. I am counting on you to ensure that equality between men and women is respected at this level also. Hélène Flautre,

Mr President, the last time we held a debate after a tragedy in the Mediterranean was on 1 April. You will recall that many hundreds of migrants perished off the Libyan coast. We had called for an investigation. To date we have received no information concerning the circumstances of that tragedy. Since then, as you know, in mid-August, 73 Africans were found dead off Lampedusa. On 25 August, 57 Eritrean migrants were finally rescued after a lengthy spell in Maltese waters. On 31 August, 75 Somalis were refused entry to Libya. Really, the external borders of the European Union have become murderous. This is the title of a report due out by the NGO ‘Migreurop’, which I invite all of you, ladies and gentlemen, to obtain and to read assiduously. Confronted with this situation, Mr Barrot, you refer to some key issues. You refer to the right of asylum, to the right to international protection. You should also refer to the right of any person to leave any country, and to the obligation placed on everyone to help others, whoever they may be. This is international maritime law. These situations are on the increase, and they are also occurring more and more at the border between Turkey and Greece. This is why I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that strengthening Frontex’s resources will be the answer to this situation. I believe that the European Union, today, is up against its own project. The European Union was born out of the refusal to deny others their dignity, and it is to this that it must remain true. Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, this gives me an opportunity to clarify two small points which, I believe – and as one of my fellow Members said just now – highlight the hypocritical nature of our policy. The first point concerns the Dublin agreements. Commissioner, you know the situation in Calais well; you know that, in Calais, many people could easily apply for and obtain political refugee status. Why do they not do so? Because, as a result of the Dublin agreements, they are guaranteed to be sent to countries to which they do not want to go, and sometimes for excellent reasons. They do not want to go to Greece, where they have practically no chance of receiving refugee status. Today, the Dublin agreements are an instrument that is hostile to the protection of those people who need them most and which create inequality among the Member States. So let us stop talking about solidarity, when instruments are put in place that create inequality among the States. The second point concerns the readmission agreements. I fully understand, the aim is to negotiate these agreements with Turkey and with Libya, that is, to toy with the idea of having one huge environment of countries that are our neighbours and huge camps for holding the migratory flows. This is unacceptable for practical reasons, for moral reasons and for political reasons, and you know it, Mr Barrot! Hélène Flautre  (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have a problem which means that I am not going to vote for you tomorrow, but you know what it is, since my group has explained it well. It is a political issue. You do not have a project for transforming Europe environmentally and socially. And yet that is, I believe, what needs to be done today. However, as Mr Daul elegantly put it, it was the right that won the elections, therefore you are on the right. The situation is clear. I should like, however, to be able to have respect for the President of the Commission, but I have a problem with this: when I see you, I inevitably think – and I assure you this is true – of your responsibility in the CIA’s secret flights. Between 2002 and 2006, 728 people were transferred to Guantánamo via Portuguese airspace. You were minister from 2002 to 2004. I therefore cannot believe you, Mr Barroso, when you make declamations about Europe being a champion of human rights. What I expect from you – what I hope for from you, because I would like, in the future, to respect you as President of the Commission – is not your memoirs, in however many years’ time, but that you will acknowledge your responsibilities in this serious act, which casts a shadow over European values.
