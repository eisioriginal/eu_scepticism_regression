 Mr President, I welcome this timely report by Mr Oostlander. It contains a number of valuable recommendations. On Monday I returned from Turkey, where, with other politicians and trade unionists, I had the opportunity to observe the local elections. Paragraph 1 of the recommendations of this report refers to the 'oft-stated commitment' by the Turkish authorities 'to democracy and Europe'. I cannot share the same confidence. Whilst seeking to observe elections in the primary school of Vali Unal Erkan in Diyarbakir, we were shouted at, threateningly, by the local chief of police and prevented from entering the polling station. This was not an isolated incident. In polling stations in other parts of the country, members of the governing Turkish party were standing by, watching ballot papers being filled in by Kurdish electors. The military were present outside many polling stations within the Kurdish area. Speakers of the Kurdish language – spoken by 20 million people in Turkey – continue to face persecution. Kurdish-medium schools are banned, the only concession being the belated effort now to allow a few schoolrooms to be open to teach Kurdish as a foreign language for a few hours a week. How can we then say, in paragraph 8, that we have confidence that the AKP government will safeguard democratic values? As the report emphasises, the prohibition of political parties such as Hadep/Dehap continues, which is why I would urge colleagues to support Amendment No 11 by Mr Lagendijk on the crucial issue of abolishing the 10% threshold for political parties. Until these fundamental matters are addressed and the Turkish Government respects our own Charter of Fundamental Rights, many of us will have grave misgivings before supporting their accession to the European Union.

 Mr President, I welcome Mr Maat's attempt to tackle this very difficult subject. Animal welfare is a very emotive issue in many ways, so any new legislation must be based on sound veterinary and scientific information. To judge from the amount of lobbying on this issue, this is clearly a very important issue for the citizens of the European Union. I particularly welcome amendments acknowledging difficulties facing remote and peripheral areas for the transportation of animals – including Wales and the Western Isles of Scotland. That is an important inclusion within the body of the report. I hope we do not get bogged down, for example, in whether it is to be eight or nine hours. Rather, we should focus on what in my view is the far more important issue of proper policing of the regulations and ensuring that the rules are as practical and as workable as they can be. I would like to see the live trade ultimately replaced by a carcass trade, with animals slaughtered locally. We know of the dangers of not slaughtering locally in the wake of the epidemics of foot-and-mouth and other diseases, where because of transportation of animals, those kinds of diseases spread across the country far more easily. Where the transport of live animals is necessary, I hope we will end up with legislation that is both firm and fair for the industry.

 Mr President, I am especially glad that these programmes will guarantee the financial stability of organisations such as Youth Forum, Jeunesse, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator information and documentation centres amongst many others. Youth Forum and Jeunesse fulfil an important role in empowering and engaging young people in civil society, which is so important. They also provide young people with an environment to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding and self-motivated learning. Likewise the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator have both played, and will continue to play, an important role in safeguarding and promoting minority languages in the European Union. Their presence and work is especially needed now that 10 new countries will join the Union and further enhance the number of existing minority languages. There are 40 million minority-language speakers now. Six million other people speaking minority languages will join. It is crucial that the speakers of these languages enjoy the same rights and possibilities that have been available to everyone else. I welcome also the measures to increase transparency in the decisions to allocate grants to organisations and also the user-friendliness of the grant application process which at the moment is far too cumbersome. Nevertheless I regret that in the case of youth NGOs the principle of degressivity remains in the common position, which will mean that the reduction of their funds from the third year onwards will make things rather difficult for them. Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs would be the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness in future. I very much hope that these excellent reports will be endorsed by a substantial majority in Parliament.

 Mr President, the European Union must raise concerns about the unhealthy practices that have developed alongside the industrialisation and mass transportation of livestock in parts of Asia. Animal disease now travels far and fast in types of farming and food distribution. That makes it very difficult to control. In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw materials where they are cheapest, and the European poultry industry has struggled to compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil, where labour costs are very much lower. The UK alone imported 36 649 tonnes of poultry meat from Thailand in the first ten months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year. But in the light of this flu virus we must maintain the strictest food safety standards here in the European Union, ensuring that all imports meet those very same high standards. Modern food systems mean that animal diseases travel far and travel quickly. The outbreak of avian flu in the Netherlands last year illustrated how hard the disease can be to contain. Does the Commission believe that all health authorities in the European Union would spot avian flu and be able to react decisively enough if it arrived on this continent?

 Mr President, I welcome the work of the rapporteur in bringing this own-initiative report together. It strikes at the heart of the central question facing European agriculture at this crucial juncture, namely, whether the agricultural community can expect to make a fair living from its activities. One of the report's most illustrative points is that, while agricultural incomes rose by 7% in the EU between 1995 and 2002, this was at the expense of a 15% decrease in the number of farms. That means that small farms have been swallowed up by increasingly large farms and production that has become more intensive. With consumers demanding more information on the means by which their food is produced, this trend is one that must be addressed. Large farms, selling bulk commodities, with pollution risks and herd health problems represent a future that we must work to avoid. Whilst the figures may continue to suggest that incomes are growing, they hide the impact of increasingly intensive farming methods. This must be borne in mind each time the European Parliament – and more importantly, the European Commission – consider direct aid via the CAP. There is something seriously amiss with a system that continues to pump money into the pockets of some of Europe's largest and wealthiest landowners through lavish subsidies. The Duke of Westminster – Britain's richest man – receives EUR 1300 per day in agricultural subsidies, while small Welsh farmers are struggling to get by with as little as EUR 7000 per year. (Applause)

 Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr De Rossa for this very important report. The illegal bushmeat trade is devastating endangered species and habitats in many developing countries. I welcome and endorse one recommendation in particular: to step up measures to detect and prevent illegal imports of bushmeat into Europe. Incredibly, smuggling illegal meat into Europe through ports and airports is still relatively easy despite the fact that this almost certainly caused the devastating foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001, to which Mr Parish referred. The European Union must set an example here and send a clear message to smugglers that any bushmeat they bring to ports of entry will be detected and they will be prosecuted. Regrettably, this violent, profitable trade continues unabated and thousands of tonnes of illegal bushmeat, from West Africa in particular, is slipping undetected into Europe each year, with organised gangs going unpunished. It must be said that the United States is showing us the way here: anyone who has recently travelled through a US airport will undoubtedly have been confronted by a hardworking beagle sniffing every piece of luggage for imported foodstuffs. I implore the European Commission to get tough with Member States. Finally I also urge colleagues to reject irrelevant amendments to this report which seek to defend local European hunting practices and will inevitably weaken its recommendations.

 I base my supplementary question on Article 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that: 'Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.' Member States must adhere to directives laid down by the EU, and France is clearly contravening, rather than adhering to, directives that are laid down in law. Would the Council representative therefore pursue this matter in the Council and consider bringing France before the Court of Human Rights?

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Adam, who has worked very hard on this report. From our initial Committee discussions it was evident that these proposals had been drafted with little, if any, appreciation or understanding of the sheep farming industry. Many of the Members who have visited sheep farms, or who are indeed farmers themselves, have become increasingly exasperated by the Commission's blind approach in this regard. I have been visited in Strasbourg this week by a group of farmers from Wales who would be happy, if they were allowed, to bring sheep with ear-tags into the Chamber to give the officials an idea of the impracticality of what is being proposed. Like me, they want to improve traceability in this sector to avoid any future spread of disease, but this must be achieved in a realistic way. In Wales, which has the highest concentration of sheep in the EU, you could not realistically at present expect to convince a traditional hill farmer, with an average age of 58 and an average annual income of EUR 10 000, of the benefits of investing in new and complicated technology, the set-up costs for which have been estimated at EUR 15 000. I urge the Commission to take on board the report's major recommendations, to come back with a comprehensive cost analysis for these proposals and to acknowledge the effectiveness of recording batch movements of sheep until such time as electronic identification becomes a viable and practical proposition.

 Mr President, I should like to apologise for the absence of two other Members from my Group, Mrs Ahern and Mrs Echerer, who are not able to be present this evening. I wish to express my thanks and gratitude to Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, but my main thanks go to Mrs Prets, even though she is not present, for her excellent work on this report, which shows a great understanding for the needs and objectives of youth NGOs. In an increasingly individualistic society, the role that youth NGOs play in engaging young people in civil society is crucial. As Youth Forum Jeunesse
 said in its recent policy paper, youth NGOs are social agents that empower young people; they are environments for non-formal learning and are specifically suitable, therefore, for young people to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding, self-motivation, project-management, conflict-resolution, organisation of skills and more. Youth NGO activities are heavily reliant, of course, on grants. That is why I welcome that all kinds of youth organisations, including Youth Forum Jeunesse
 and other international non-governmental youth NGOs, are excluded from the principle of digressivity which would mean a reduction of 2.5% in their funds from the third year onwards. Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs is the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness and efforts in creating a generation of young people that will become more socially involved. I also support the proposal to improve the user-friendliness of the grant application process. At the moment it is far too complicated. Therefore, I completely endorse Mrs Pack's Amendment 16, which gives applicants the opportunity to correct errors after submitting their applications. This should reduce the number of applications that are rejected for technical reasons. I also very much hope that Mrs Pack's excellent report will be endorsed by a substantial majority to guarantee a legal basis to effectively fund international youth NGOs.

Today, through Mr Ebner's report we are at last putting that into practice and supporting language learning and multilingualism, including minority languages, like the language I am speaking now, Welsh, my mother tongue.'] Mr President, I would like to thank the interpreters for translating the first part of my address – which was in Welsh – to be understood by the rest of the Members here. I wish to begin by congratulating and thanking Mr Ebner for adventuring in the task of writing a report on European minority languages and presenting so many constructive ideas to further respect for multilingualism in Europe. We all know how sensitive this issue of minority languages is in some countries which consider them a threat not only to the integrity of their state culture but also to their territorial integrity. The issue of minority languages is a matter very close to my heart, because I am, myself – as are many others in this Chamber – a speaker of a minority language. Minority-language speakers are no different to speakers of other languages. We only want to live a full life through the medium of our language, whilst not giving up, of course, the pleasure of learning and mastering many languages which open doors to cultures and windows to a better understanding of others. I welcome the fact that minority languages are back on the European agenda. For many years we have been in a stalemate over the legal funding for minority languages in Europe. The Commission and the Council have dragged their feet on this issue for far too long. Therefore, today's debate in Parliament is a major step forward which should ultimately lead to new legislation. Minority languages must be sustained and promoted if we are to live up to the claim of a Europe of diversity. At this important juncture in Europe's future, with new members joining the Union, the European Parliament is again leading the cause for greater respect for minority-language speakers. I wish Mr Ebner well with his report.

 Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Sylla for his thorough report on the situation of the fundamental rights in the Union in 2002. The length of this report makes it clear that the European Union, which constantly preaches respect for fundamental rights to the rest of the world, is not yet free from breaches to these rights within its own borders. As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for this report, I am happy that in paragraph 38 Italy is finally and explicitly named and shamed concerning its media concentration and the influence in this regard of its Prime Minister, without any rules at all on conflict of interest being adopted. I say I am glad because the majority of Members on the Culture Committee sadly voted against making an example of Italy for its bad record in media concentration, which poses a very serious threat to democracy everywhere. We all know that individual media conglomerates control a significant portion of the national news media in several European countries: Bertelsmann and Kirch in Germany, Rupert Murdoch's empire in the United Kingdom and Vivendi 
in France. But Berlusconi's combination of media influence and political power is unique in Europe. A recent report on media conflict of interest in Italy by the NGO Reporters Without Borders quotes Freimut Duve, the OCSE's representative for media freedom, who has repeatedly condemned the concentration of so much of the Italian news media in the Prime Minister's hands. The OSCE says it is both a challenge to the European constitutional architecture and a bad example for new democracies in transition. The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly also holds that the potential conflict of interest between the holding of political office by Mr Berlusconi and his private economic and media interests is a threat to media pluralism. I could elaborate further, but I am sure you all understand the problems that media ownership concentration in Italy poses to democracy and freedom of information. I sincerely hope, therefore, that you all agree that the case of Italy should be included in this report.

 – Mr President, in this Parliament we have discussed the CAP often, and at length. I hope this time we shall achieve some conclusive results. I am sure I speak on behalf of the whole farming community in that regard. I come from a country, Wales, where the per annum income of some of our farmers, especially in the less-favoured areas, 80% of our nation, is as low now as EUR 6 000. This is at a time when the large supermarkets receiving their products are recording their best profits ever. Such a situation is totally unsustainable. The plethora of amendments to the reports highlight the conflicting viewpoints on this very emotive issue. We must avoid a situation where a small number of the large Member States dictates the future shape of European agriculture at the expense of a more representative and democratic decision. The lesser regions and nations in the European Union, with endemic problems of the exodus of young people from rural communities, small family farms and less-favoured areas, should also be involved in the important decisions taking place. The general swing now towards partial decoupling weakens what could have been a bold move on the Commission's part. It could at least have provided the mechanism for Member States, and importantly the nations and regions within them, to target support at their own priorities through national envelopes. To this end, as has been mentioned by other Members, democratic representation of regions in the Council of Ministers is vital, as well as codecision for the Committee on Agriculture. My problem with a mixture of the current livestock support schemes and the new decoupling scheme is that it would result in an uneven playing field for many sectors and bring increased bureaucracy and more barriers for producers aiming to focus on the market. If this means people having to leave small family farms in less productive areas to find work, it risks undermining the very foundations on which these rural communities are built. I know this is a scenario that the Commissioner will be keen to avoid. Having discussed this topic extensively with Welsh farmers, I find that what they undoubtedly want is simpler, more market-focused policies to help farms return to profitability.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Commissioner Byrne for the commitment he has shown to the work of the parliamentary Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth and, indeed, for ensuring that the main findings of our report have featured prominently in the Commission's directive. I also thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for working so tirelessly on the matter since day one. To have reached this final stage is a positive advertisement for the European Parliament. When the temporary committee visited regions affected by this terrible disease, including my own country of Wales, we were told by people how grateful they were that the European Parliament had set up this inquiry as they had no other way of voicing their grievances within their own Member States. This directive makes several valuable recommendations relating to the tightening of import controls – which has already been mentioned – setting contingency plans, establishing expert groups and moving emergency vaccination to the forefront of disease control, in line with the welcome changes made to international trade rules. Central to the UK Government's mishandling of the 2001 crisis was its lack of a clear-cut policy on whether and when vaccination should have been used. This led to the unacceptable continuous culling, which was based on flawed scientific evidence, and the blinkered decision to reject vaccination. In the event of future outbreaks, slaughtering should be limited to infected premises, based on sound laboratory tests. We owe it to our rural communities everywhere to learn the lessons of 2001.

. – Mr President, I also wish to commend and thank Mr Van den Berg for his excellent efforts on this most important of issues. If there were only 100 people living on this earth, 15 would be illiterate. While societies enter into the information and knowledge society and modern technologies develop and spread at rapid speed, 860 million adults are illiterate. Over 100 million children have no access to school and countless children, youths and adults who attend school or other education programmes fall short of the required level to be considered literate in today's complex world and society. One of the main effects of low or no income is lack of education, insufficient schooling or, worse, lack of access to school education, which is one of the single most limiting factors in life. The poor have no access at all to training. Those deprived of an education or skills and vocational training have difficulty in finding work or developing their business talents. Poverty prevents both children and adults from going to school. Modern technology is not open to all on an equal footing, so the gap between rich and poor is widening. Poor people in far-flung rural areas often find it hard, if not impossible, to attend school because it is just too far for them to go. Insufficient education also prevents lots of people from knowing their rights or the benefits to which they are entitled. It makes it more difficult to handle any kind of relationship with local or national administrations, to obtain loans from a credit institution or to resist all sorts of abuses. Insufficient education also makes it more difficult to analyse information given by the media and political rhetoric. Overall Community programmes are still not sufficiently focused on reducing poverty. The proportion of Community aid spent in low-income countries has fallen from 70% in 1990 to 38% now. There are also too many programmes. What is needed is a radical simplification of development programmes. The unhealthy focus on geopolitical regions should be ended and a global approach to poverty reduction should be central. Resources should be allocated where they can do most to reduce poverty. Although, as I said, the European Union is the world's largest aid donor, the Commission and Member States should give this area greater financial attention as it is through investing in education in developing countries that we can begin to put an end to poverty.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, it is not the first time that this Parliament has discussed issues concerning the violation of human rights by the Turkish Government. Unless we are seen to defend the charters and treaties which we have designed ourselves, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and legislation on human rights, then we run the risk of becoming a laughing stock within the international community. I personally have had occasion in the past to condemn the Turkish Government for the imprisonment without trial of many among the Kurdish community, as I have also condemned the 14-year imprisonment sentence imposed on Leyla Zana and three of her colleagues. They all campaigned for the rights of the Kurds and in 1995 Leyla Zana won our own European Parliament Sakharov Prize. A retrial of Leyla Zana was ordered following a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg, a court the international community established itself, because the original trial of Leyla Zana and her colleagues was deemed not to be equitable. Once again we have to raise in this Parliament a further breach of human rights standards in the wake of a search of the Ankara headquarters of the Human Rights Association of Turkey. The Human Rights Association performs internationally recognised work in the realm of human rights in Turkey and provides Members of this Parliament with invaluable data on human rights atrocities. Therefore we regard it as a violation of the defence of human rights when the promotion of these standards is thus impeded. Is it any wonder that some of us once more ask whether Turkey's request for membership of the European Union should be supported? For the record, the Human Rights Association has found that 183 people were subjected to torture, ill-treatment and detention in Turkey in the first quarter of this year alone. A Union presidency that prides itself on defending the human rights of minorities and the oppressed everywhere cannot stand by and allow such violations to continue.

 – I would like to ask whether the European Union, in the light of the information conveyed to us, can make representations to the United Nations to at least respond in a constructive manner as to the future status of the Saharan people. Since the 60s they have been promised a referendum and there has been deliberation and an impasse which is creating a very difficult situation for a large population of people living in refugee camps. Would it be possible for the European Union, through you, President, to make representations, even by letter, to the United Nations expressing our concern about this very important issue?
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's proposal to set up a programme to encourage student and scholar mobility around the world. I also wish to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her work on this report. European universities have much to offer the world in terms of their scientific and teaching excellence. I therefore welcome a programme which will enhance and strengthen the attractiveness of European higher education. Moreover, it will allow this sector to compete with other countries, particularly the United States and Canada, in attracting talented and motivated students and scholars from third countries. In this respect I welcome the proposal to increase the multiannual budget from EUR 200 million to EUR 300 million. That is very important as long as it does not impede and take money away from important programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci. Nevertheless, the Erasmus Mundus programme should not only benefit European universities but also contribute to the improvement of standards of living, to the development of human resources and the raising of poverty thresholds in third countries. I reiterate the point made by other speakers that it is very important for us to develop the linguistic capacities of our students throughout the European Union. There is no point in talking about a Europe of diversity unless we provide people with the proper skills in languages that will enhance that goal.
Wyn (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, digital literacy is of course one of the essential skills needed to participate fully in the knowledge society in which we are all living today. Not having access to the Internet or lacking ICT skills is becoming a barrier to social integration and to personal development. A large number of jobs in services and industry now call for employees to possess all-round ICT skills, and that is why a programme such as eLearning is essential to achieve the overall objective of the 2000 Lisbon Summit, of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010. I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, that we should teach ICT skills from a very young age up to university level, and ensure that schools and universities and, more importantly, the teachers themselves, are capable of using all the new technologies. Nevertheless, we cannot forget that there are many disadvantaged groups unable to benefit from traditional educational and training provisions, who are consequently becoming increasingly isolated both socially and culturally because they are not digitally literate. I would endorse the point that has been made already regarding the importance of maintaining the 25% from the budget to bridge the digital divide. In many areas, not only in accession countries, but in my own area of Wales, which is an Objective 1 area, it is vitally important for us to maintain the 25%, because many of those communities have not yet bridged the important digital divide that is emerging.
Wyn, Eurig (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I was also part of a delegation from the Verts/ALE Group which went to Iraq last week, and we would like to say to those eminent Members of Parliament who criticised the visit that it was an important and timely initiative for peace, during which we also had occasion to criticise the Iraqi Government in no uncertain terms and call for the resignation of Saddam Hussein. There is genuine desire for peace in Iraq. It is a country devastated by sanctions, with teachers and university professors earning as little as USD 10 per month and 3 000 children a month dying of malnutrition and the lack of essential medicine. If war finally breaks out there, the only means through which the country presently survives - the Oil for Food programme – will come to an end and throw the country into massive chaos. It will create 900 000 refugees – those are not my figures, they are figures produced by the United Nations – who will flee, not to America, but to countries in the Middle East and Europe, creating an unprecedented humanitarian aid disaster. If the human tragedy unfolding before us can be resolved peacefully – and I am heartened by the initiative of several countries now, calling for more staff resources and more time for the weapons inspectors and for the possible intervention of a UN peace keeping force – then surely that is the only alternative before us. If weapons inspectors can avoid the deaths of half a million civilians, then that is surely the only logical course of action we can consider. This imminent war is also about human rights and democracy in Iraq. I visited a Kurdish refugee camp in Makhtur in northern Iraq, where 10 000 refugees from Turkey are captives in their own camp. They are allowed to leave the camp only under strict surveillance. The latest understanding between America and Turkey, ceding control over the whole of the devolved Kurdish territory in the north of Iraq, is a nightmare scenario in which the Kurds will again face persecution and attack. How long can the international community allow the continued suffering of the Kurdish people? Democracy must apply to all in any new Iraqi administration: to the Kurds, the Shias and the Turkmens and, of course, to the Iraqis themselves. But it must be achieved through peaceful means, not through the bombing and killing of half a million defenceless men, women and children. (Applause)

 – Mr President, the European Union has made clear its commitment to reforming the agricultural trading system - firstly to secure a future for Europe's farmers and, on the other hand, to recognise the need for special treatment for the developing countries. This is no mean feat. In fact it is very difficult, as we have people on one side who believe the Commission is going too far, and others who believe that it is acting far too cautiously. If the European Union is to have a credible voice in the Doha process, this procrastination must stop. With enlargement on our doorstep we must act immediately. The Commission's proposals will benefit European farmers in the long term and improve prospects for meaningful global trade liberalisation talks. I hope that we send the clear message that it is the farmers themselves who should receive a greater share of the market price, and not the increasing numbers of powerful monopolies that are controlling, in a devastating manner, our agricultural industry at the present moment in time. The balance we seek is to support small farmers - 90% of the farmers in my country, Wales, are small farmers who farm in less favoured areas - and rural development and Pillar II, on the one hand, while also taking account of farmers in the Third World. It is a very difficult balancing act. We can no longer continue with a situation where the average European dairy cow now has a bigger annual income, thanks to European subsidies, than half of the world's population.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, the danger with foreign policy initiatives designed to counter terrorism following the 11 September disaster is that we are deluded into thinking that in the parts of the world where this strategy has been deployed everything has therefore been resolved. The reality is, however, rather different. In Afghanistan, most of the country outside Kabul is still under the control of warlords and regional leaders who continue to commit human rights abuses on a large scale, including torture and the disappearance of Afghan civilians. Women's rights, as has already been mentioned, are also consistently being violated. Along with the detention of 600 people without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that Mr Sakellariou mentioned, these are matters that we tend to forget, deluding ourselves that the problems have been and are being resolved. In Afghanistan, in the Herat province under the governorship of Ismail Khan, the situation has deteriorated. Whereas once there was a liberal, literary and cultural tradition, women are again being persecuted and barred from education, health care and the justice system. Even under the Taliban there was at least a semblance of central control that limited the excesses of these regional autocrats. Now many regions have reverted to a quasi-dictatorship and reconstruction funds are benefiting regional leaders who are committing human rights abuses politically and financially. This must stop. UNAMA, the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, must stop funding these offending warlords immediately. Some of us in the European Parliament recently saw a film by Jamie Doran, the Scottish film-maker, backing with hard evidence the existence of a mass grave in the Mazar-i-Sharif region which might contain the remains of 3 000 prisoners of war, killed and tortured by anti-Taliban forces. This is an atrocity that members of the American forces witnessed and did not prevent. I am glad the United Nations and the European Union have now agreed to investigate this alleged crime.

 – Mr President, I commend the rapporteur and welcome this excellent initiative. Apart from being an important social phenomenon and a way to improve psychological and physical health, sport is also an excellent educational instrument which helps young people acquire important social skills. That is why I strongly and warmly welcome the celebration of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004. I am most looking forward to seeing the positive impact that sport will have on the lives of young people from disadvantaged communities as a result of this programme. It will present sport as a way of improving the social inclusion of these groups and communities. Nevertheless, I regret that both the Council and the Commission rejected Parliament's amendments providing for the organisation of school competitions which would have allowed winning schools to attend the next Olympic Games in Greece. That said, however, I welcome the Council's recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I wish to say at the outset that the committee is very grateful that we secured this inquiry. As we are all aware, the initial decision to hold an inquiry was not without its difficulties. It was opposed by the UK Government, which also expressed misgivings as to the duration of the inquiry. It felt that six months was sufficient. However, we would never have accomplished what we did had we not been allowed a 12-month duration. That was vital for us to undertake the task asked of us. On the matter of the three-kilometre contiguous culling, in my own nation, Wales, up to 700 farms were culled of all their animals and only on 60 of those farms were there proven cases of the foot and mouth epidemic. I stress this because, in some of the opposing amendments, the Socialist Group implies, and I quote their justification: 'There was no evidence that animal welfare was violated in more than a handful of instances.' If animals were culled on this scale with no proven blood-tested evidence, it was a clear and blatant violation of animal welfare, and on a large scale. I am disappointed at Mr Byrne's unwillingness to countenance or even research into a prophylactic routine vaccination in future, and this at a time when the Commission has advertised in farming publications – daily and weekly in the UK – all sorts of routine vaccinations to tackle all sorts of epidemics and diseases. On the matter of the legality of the cull in the UK, it is quite unacceptable that, based on two court cases alone in Britain, the cull had a legal basis. In future we must have proper contingency planning. It is quite astounding that the government of the day in the UK had no tried and tested contingency plan in place. I also have grave doubts as to whether we have had sufficient consultation with civil society and simulation exercises to ensure that, if there were an outbreak tomorrow morning, we would all know what to do and how to respond to it. The epidemic in the UK was a catalogue of errors. Regions like my own had no idea at all how to tackle the situation and no powers devolved to them to undertake their task of tackling it effectively. In the interests of communities everywhere throughout Europe, it is vital that the same mistakes are not allowed to happen again.

 – Mr President, it would be a grave misconception to look at the imminent attack on the Iraqi state as a new state of affairs. We all know that the attacks on Iraq are already underway on a massive scale in the no-fly zones in the country. I do not know under which international agreements they have been allowed to continue, but such attacks have only intensified and worsened the situation in the country. However we view, as a Parliament, the proposed attack on Saddam Hussein, we cannot look at it in isolation. The attack would be seen, along with the incursions against Palestine, as an attack on the Arab world itself. It would, along with the threat to oil supplies, globalise an already-escalating conflict. We condemn Saddam Hussein unreservedly for his regime which oppresses minorities and offends democracy in Iraq. A more sensible and productive international approach, however, would be to defend and ensure self-determination for all minorities in Iraq, especially the five million Kurds in the north of the country comprising one quarter of the Iraqi population. Human rights and freedom in Iraq would be better served were we to take that course of action, uniting minorities and the international community behind a common front to topple Saddam and all other world dictators.

rapporteur
. – Madam President, it is my pleasure in this report to endorse the annual report for 2001 submitted by the Ombudsman, which is a comprehensive and detailed overview of the activities conducted during the year and in particular of all the various cases processed. After seven years, the role of the European Ombudsman – to enhance openness and democratic accountability in the decision-making and administration of the European Union – is well established. By tackling maladministration in the Community institutions and bodies, the role of the Ombudsman has made an essential contribution towards a Union in which decisions are truly taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen. The fact that the number of direct complaints is still on the increase again in 2001 clearly demonstrates that the Ombudsman is reaching more and more people in the course of his activities. Despite this steady rise in complaints, the report welcomes the reduction in time taken to deal with each case. The present Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, from whom we have already heard, has become a well recognised and respected figure in the European Union and his receipt of awards such as the Alexis de Tocqueville prize further demonstrates this. He has even paid a visit to my own country, Wales, showing a commitment and dedication through his work to visit some of the most important places in the world. During his time in office he has emphasised the Rule of Law, taking fundamental rights seriously and applying basic principles of good administration, such as transparency, responsibility and respect for citizens. This has been done in no less than 15 Member States and through the medium of 12 Community languages. He deserves his retirement! The report very much welcomes the fact that the European authorities are increasingly taking action to settle a complaint once they are made aware of the problem in question and that, in other cases, a friendly solution has been arrived at. The Ombudsman must also be commended for his efforts to inform more citizens of their right to complain. This is a matter that the Committee on Petitions is continually aware of. This means that the Ombudsman's work has to include the continuous updating of his website with a view to making his role known to an ever-wider public and to establishing networks of links with regional ombudsmen. In this regard the Ombudsman is faced with, on the one hand, wanting to inform as many people as possible of this right to complain and, on the other, remembering that the remit of his office is limited to the Community institutions. We in Parliament have a role to play here, in ensuring that we remain aware of the Ombudsman's role and informing citizens of this right. The work of the Ombudsman, however, has not been without obstacles during this period. In the field of good administration the European Parliament adopted unanimously last September the European Union Code on Good Administrative Behaviour and called on the Commission to propose a regulation on the subject. I welcome the Ombudsman's decision to apply the principles set out in this code in his activities. I should like to express my disappointment here, however, that the Commission has yet to act on this important request. The report calls for Parliament to consider drawing up a legislative initiative report on the basis of this model code under Article 192 and Rule 59. In relation to openness and good administrative behaviour this report notes attempts by certain institutions to use recently adopted data protection rules to impose confidentiality on their activities. It must be made clear that data protection rules are mainly concerned with the protection of private and family life and certainly should not in any way restrict the information available to citizens on the activities of the European Union institutions. With regard to the infringement procedure, the Article 226 procedure, in which the Commission investigates complaints about infringements of Community law by Member States, which continues to be the subject of complaints to the Ombudsman – and this is something with which we in the Committee on Petitions are all too familiar – the report finds that, despite recent improvements, this procedure is secretive, and that the complainant is still not recognised as a participant. Delays occur because the Commission has too many cases to deal with. The Ombudsman was on the record for criticising the Commission's recent handling of the Greek environmental complaint, in this case involving infringements of Community environmental law by the Greek authorities; enquiries revealed a catalogue of information being concealed, the wrong directive being applied and a failure to ensure that the case was dealt with impartially. Whilst we appreciate the hard work carried out by the Commission, the Ombudsman and our Committee on Petitions depend on their investigations being effective, and we must be confident that such cases are being handled correctly. Finally, I welcome the offer by the Ombudsman to develop joint activities with the Committee on Petitions with a view to reinforcing the contacts and exchange of experience with national and regional Ombudsmen and committees on petitions. Closer cooperation between the European Ombudsman's office and the Committee on Petitions is vital. Our work is very much interlinked and we were provided with excellent examples of how this could be achieved when the Ombudsman addressed the Committee on Petitions in April. I commend the report to the House and wish the Ombudsman a very happy retirement.

 – Madam President, I very much welcome this initiative. It was a very necessary initiative and I commend it. Universities are the cornerstone of our societies, so encouraging universities, students and teachers to forge closer links and share experiences will play a crucial role in enriching our societies. It will also increase European competitiveness, because universities play an important role now in the business sector. Many higher education establishments are already suffering a funding crisis and European Union higher education legislation will not be brought closer without proper financial commitment. I urge the Commission, the Council and Parliament to ensure this happens, because it is vital that this initiative is properly funded. However, I would have liked to see more emphasis on the teaching of modern foreign languages, since linguistic barriers are one of the main impediments to mobility. In my own country, the UK, the compulsory teaching of foreign languages is being cut back. Providing an optional language is very important. I commend this report to the House and fully support it.

 in writing
. – Mr Olsson has already mentioned in his report the political and economic importance of agriculture in all CEECs and the structural changes that are required in their rural areas. It is also crucial to bring agriculture and the foodstuffs industries into line with the European Union standards, especially hygiene and veterinary standards. But we must also accept that many candidate countries practice far less intensive methods of agriculture and give a more prominent place to rural development. To give a positive signal for enlargement, we should give the candidate countries equal voice in the discussions on the future of agricultural policy. We should also concentrate on the issue of direct payments and the proposal for the phasing in of direct payments. This must not be a stumbling block for enlargement. Whilst agreeing that the gradual introduction of direct payments would prevent a sudden excessive influx of cash, with over-production as an end result, it would also mean the unequal treatment of the new Member States during the ten-year transitional period, which would be very discouraging for them. The EU should make clear that there must in the longer term be a single common agricultural policy for all Member States, with all players starting on an equal footing.

 – Mr President, the European Year of Education through Sport will provide an excellent opportunity for promoting the social importance of sport within our society and will be a very powerful tool for promoting integration. One third of Europe's citizens pursue a physical activity on a regular basis, making sport one of the most significant social phenomena in Europe in the 20th century. Sport is an excellent way to engage people in their communities. It can contribute to education and lifelong learning, as well as promoting qualities of leadership, citizenship and teamwork. The Year of Education through Sport should concentrate on the social inclusion aspect of sport. However, for this to become a reality, we need to provide better facilities within deprived communities. What I am deeply concerned about is the lack of group leaders and volunteers to run sports projects, especially in the more depressed regions. What will be in the programme to address this? Also it is important that projects chosen should provide a firm foundation on which to build. The momentum provided during 2004 must carry on beyond 2004 – it should not stop there. It should become an established part of projects within our communities. The involvement of local and regional authorities also during the year will be crucial to its eventual success, as they are in a unique position to ensure that the widest possible access to local community action is achieved. Sport is not only a form of entertainment for the spectator. It also has a strong social dimension and it is this social dimension that should be one of the main themes during the year. All sports should be included, not just the mainstream sports – and we need to emphasise this throughout the programme. It is also important to link projects started under the European Year of Disability in 2003 with sporting projects for the disabled in 2004. No one should be excluded. I thank the rapporteur for an excellent initiative and look forward to participating in the development of the projects throughout the year.

 – Mr President, I would also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for his work on this very important report. The explosion in broadcasting technologies has caused many parents to lose control over what their children watch, and the growth of digital, cable and satellite TV, as well as home computer technology, means that parents are increasingly powerless to monitor their children's viewing habits. According to some reports, parents were not aware of the facilities, such as the blocks on pay TV and Internet filters, which help them control what their children watch. Parents need to be given more information on how these work and how trustworthy they are. Children's welfare is primarily the responsibility of their legal guardians, but this does not absolve suppliers and distributors of audiovisual content of their responsibilities. Both sides must take full responsibility in this regard. The degree of self-regulation in broadcasting differs from one Member State to another, but we all agree that we must work towards some commonality in this area and that self-regulation must be underpinned by some legal basis. Finally, child pornography on the Internet is unforgivable, and there are vast numbers of websites with illegal content located outside the European Union. I commend the report to the House and thank the rapporteur again for his excellent initiative in this regard.

 – Mr President, I am very glad to have the opportunity to address Parliament on this most important of issues. The motion calls for justice and reparations for the Muslim and Tamil communities being persecuted in Sri Lanka. If 60 000 people were killed in the developed world – that is the magnitude of the atrocities we are looking at now in Sri Lanka – then every possible means would be deployed to address the matter and bring those responsible before the courts and establish the rule of law. There is serious and flagrant discrimination and economic underdevelopment in the areas of the country where the majority of the Tamil population lives. This is an area where the European Union could play a meaningful role, through funding programmes to address the imbalance and further the cause of peace and reconciliation. We must act concertedly here or more innocent Sri Lankans will join the half a million people who have already fled the country. The use of child soldiers and sexual assaults on Sri Lankan women is endemic. To turn our backs on this matter would deliver a serious blow to the important causes we often champion here of democracy, freedom and social justice. Our attendance at the donors' meeting in Sri Lanka, scheduled for May, is vital. I also call on the presidency to ensure forthwith that this resolution is conveyed to the Council, the Commission and the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

 – Mr President, I very much welcome the establishment of the second phase of Socrates and thank Mrs Pack for her excellent work. We have undoubtedly seen increased cooperation in the field of European education combined with a new commitment to life-long learning and that is heartening. In Wales, my own nation, and indeed the whole of the UK, there is a problem in encouraging the acquisition of language skills across the board. ERASMUS has gone a long way to improving this and I would like to see an increase in the figure of 460 000 participating students a year. Such exchanges make a distinct commitment to better linguistic skills, but also promote cultural cooperation. The Commission must continue to do its utmost to ensure that the application procedure is more user-friendly and I agree with comments by other speakers that at the moment the administrative side of the programme makes it difficult for participants. There has been a real administrative burden on the applicants throughout this programme, particularly under the COMENIUS scheme which needs to be addressed urgently. Regardless of how successful this programme is, it must always be as open as possible for those wishing to participate.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I welcome Mrs Gröner's report very much. Despite a belated start, the YOUTH programme has proved to be an invaluable programme. Why is this programme valuable? It is important because one of its main objectives is to include a higher proportion of disadvantaged young people: individuals, groups, or organisations, which otherwise would have no access at all to any kind of European funding. There has been some criticism, of course, concerning the high administrative costs, as the programme comprises so many small projects, which are naturally therefore more expensive to administer. I have been fortunate to have worked closely with a disadvantaged youth group from Wales, my own nation, who received funding under the programme. The young people involved gained so much and to see them speaking here in Brussels, some of whom were previously young offenders, highlighted to me the importance of this programme. The inclusion of worthwhile projects with disadvantaged youth groups, I assure you, is worth every penny of the expenditure. We must safeguard the programme and protect its main objectives of targeting disadvantaged young people.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I should like to sincerely congratulate the rapporteur on his extensive and critical work on this report on the working time directive. It was indeed quite an urgent issue to be tackled, given the controversial discussions at the several sessions of the Court of Justice on this very matter. Before I speak on a number of matters to do with the working time directive, I must say that I am very pleased that a couple of Member States have already implemented a huge number of different legislative, administrative and collective agreements in this regard. I also feel that the measures taken by the supranational decision-makers go in the right direction, since the Commission's new directives cover the areas excluded from the scope of the original directive. However, there is still a lot of work to be done. We all know – and the rapporteur did well to criticise it – that some Member States resort to the tactic of claiming that their existing legislation covers the provisions of the directive. I cannot understand, therefore, why they hesitate to implement a fairly flexible directive in the large amount of time available. I therefore agree with the report's encouragement of the Commission to investigate why the Member States refuse to comply with some of the directive's provisions. We should insist as well on controls on the conditions of application of the directive to new working-time patterns, for example, precarious work, part-time work and fixed-time work. In addition to that I see a strong need to focus more intensively on the increasing number of homeworkers. The Commission itself has made strenuous efforts with regard to open and distance learning within the Leonardo da Vinci programme, for example. I feel obliged then to ask you: why do we not give stronger encouragement to the social partners to negotiate the relevant working-time issues? Nevertheless, the report could have gone further into detail, as it unfortunately neglects so-called self-employed workers. I am convinced that the need to include this category within the directive is a matter we should all support and in doing so we should merely be adding further to a well-drafted report.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Madam President, I welcome the report as it raises many important issues as we work towards a comprehensive and a safe food policy in the EU. Control of infectious diseases goes hand in hand with proper monitoring. Close consideration should be given to how infectious diseases are monitored by European Union institutions. We must likewise question the methods of countries outside the EU and impose stricter import controls like those carried out in Australia and New Zealand. However, we must remember, if regulations are drawn up, that it is important to impose penalties on Member States which fail to implement EU legislation on feed and foodstuffs, otherwise regulations are not worth the paper they are written on. I call on Members to let common sense prevail. Of course we need to test animals for BSE, but let us base the tests on sound scientific practices. There is no proof that testing animals at 24 months is foolproof. On the contrary, animals can develop BSE after 24 months. I have had no satisfactory answers as to what this calculation is based upon. The 30-month threshold currently imposed seems to be working. The forecasts are that the UK will be BSE-free by 2005, and this has been achieved using the 30-month threshold. Meat under 30 months can now be exported from the UK and it is true to say that it has proved to be a safe product for the consumer. Another concern is the compulsory testing of sheep. Again I urge caution and call again on sound scientific evidence. The whole UK flock was nearly wiped out last year because of the discovery of BSE in sheep. However, luckily someone questioned the validity of the findings and it was then discovered that the test was actually carried out on a cow's brain after all. This episode did little to restore farmers' confidence in proper scientific research. We need to develop a comprehensive animal health strategy and ask ourselves what we have learned from BSE. The main thing, without a doubt, is not to tamper with nature on ethical grounds. Herbivores must not be made to eat meat or fishmeal. However, we must now concentrate on the future and work on a policy and strategy to undo the damage to the food chain. Finally, the farming community has suffered a great blow over the past few years. Let us work together now towards a food safety policy and a reform of the common agricultural policy which moves us away from a so-called consumer-led policy that led to intensification – but let us not move either to a consumer-led policy based on unfounded theories. We must regain consumer confidence by producing a policy that will embrace all aspects.

 – Madam President, I welcome the report on the Commission communication on the concrete objectives of education and training systems. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her conscientious work. In line with the goals of the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, it is vitally important that we enable the generation of young Europeans to choose European research careers and European scientific disciplines. I also agree that companies have to play a key role in training students and employees. However, before submitting the report we should pay attention to the following points. There seems to be a gap between the proposals in this report and the progress made by the Commission and its expert group so far. My understanding is that the Commission has already started its work on social inclusion and reset its goals on the Leonardo da Vinci programme by, for example, including older people and disabled people within its scope. This is welcome. We look forward to the European Year of Disability in 2003. In addition to that, one should not neglect the efforts made by the Commission on cooperation with the candidate countries at all levels. While not wanting to undermine the good work of the Commission, I must say that more can be done. We should also underline the importance of encouraging increased integration of European Union, Member States and regional initiatives in order to make efficient use of the relatively small budget for education and training systems. In this respect I would suggest better cooperation between the different kinds of funding and an exchange of best practice, together with better dialogue between the supranational, national and regional decision-makers within the Community. Finally, I would like to see more attention paid to the lack of equal opportunities for all individuals to experience better European integration throughout their professional lives. There are possibilities within the budget to facilitate exchanges of experience of vocational training systems in the different Member States. I encourage this. Europe can offer better education for everybody. Parliament's report should not forget to underline that.

 – Mr President, as my colleague Mrs Morgan has stressed, more than 40 million European citizens speak autochthonous languages, other than the main official language of the state in which they live. Languages are an integral part of Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity. They lie at the heart of the fundamental rights of its citizens and are a key factor in the creation of a peaceful and democratic Europe. I welcome this long-awaited resolution and urge colleagues to support it as it will be an excellent platform for the future. The European Year of Languages has been a successful year and it included many projects for Europe's regional and lesser-used languages, contrary to the expectations of many of us. The recent Council decision emphasises that, 'all European languages are equal in value and dignity from the cultural point of view'. Although the Council's decision does not refer specifically to regional and lesser-used languages, it does not exclude them either. This is why I particularly support the amendments referring to the mainstreaming of programmes and I am calling for support for a multiannual programme by 2003. This is a golden opportunity to direct this agenda for the future and in preparation for enlargement. We must ensure that Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is on the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference and that we also push for qualified majority voting in Council. Let us work together to ensure that regional and lesser-used languages are here to stay and remain part of the culturally diverse Europe of the future. Europe's unique richness is its diversity. Let us ensure that we all protect this.

 – Mr President, I have a supplementary question along the same lines and I would ask the Minister if she would be prepared to reply to it. It follows on from some of the comments and questions that have been asked already. I come from Wales, a nation with four times the population of Luxembourg, which is of course a EU Member State. Now in its November resolution on governance, Parliament stated categorically that it will welcome proposals from the Convention to redraft Article 5 of the EC Treaty to include a specific reference to the function of constitutional regions within Member States. This repeated a resolution of the previous October which stated that the Treaties should be amended specifically to recognise and respect the political and legislative powers of the internal nations and regions. Is the Council aware of these resolutions and if not, will it seek to ensure that attention is drawn to them during its deliberations at Laeken?
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I welcome this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. However, I would first of all like to highlight my concern that the current debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the failure of many Member States to implement existing Community legislation in this area. The latest Commission report, together with numerous mission reports, has highlighted that there is a serious disregard of animal welfare in some countries. The Commission must show a much greater willingness to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States which fail to enforce this directive properly. With respect to journey times, I hope the Commission will follow the recommendations of their scientific advisory committees and propose workable limits that allow businesses to function effectively, whilst maintaining a high standard of animal welfare. I will be supporting the 8-hour or 500-kilometre limit, and strongly support the view that the climate conditions of each Member State should also be taken into consideration. However, in areas where these journey times are unrealistic, a temporary dispensation to the maximum 8-hour travelling time should be granted where there are no slaughterhouses within a radius of 500 kilometres. I am thinking particularly, in the UK, of the islands of Western Scotland, and of other parts of the European Union that are affected adversely in that regard. Although putting a limit on journey times is an important step forward, the treatment of animals en route, vehicle ventilation, overcrowding, and the definition of space and temperature requirements during transport etc. are equally important issues. The recent foot-and-mouth crisis provided evidence enough that the unnecessary long-distance transport of animals was a factor in the quick spread of that disease. I look forward to the Commission's policy plan scheduled for 1 January 2003 aimed at the regionalisation of meat production chains, so as to limit the long-distance transport of live animals in future.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very hard work on this difficult report. Farming has taken a blow over the past year in the United Kingdom, and sheep farming, of course, is no exception. Given the fact that 80% of my own nation – Wales – is designated by the EU as less favoured and that sheep farming is the only available method of farming in many part of Wales, this report has far-reaching implications for Wales and its hill and upland farmers, as indeed it has for their European counterparts. I therefore welcome additional financial support for farmers situated in less-favoured areas such as Wales and I urge fellow MEPs to support additional payments for these areas. Now although this premium will not solve overnight the immediate crisis, we need to get the proposal through as quickly as possible to ensure that the sheep annual premium payments will be in place by January 2002. The original proposal was disappointing, and a lot of hard work has been put in to get the best deal possible for farmers in this regard. Of course, I want to see farmers get the fairest and highest possible premium. However, we have to work within the budget, and this is why I fully support Mr Adam's proposal of EUR 25 and am confident that the Council will consider this proposal as a very viable option given the constraints. Pitching the figure higher than this would lose money to other sectors including rural development. I will be voting against Amendment No 21, as I believe the wording to be too vague, and I would like to see a clause stating that any money put back into the national reserve from a region or country within a Member State should be ring-fenced to ensure the benefit of this fund is maintained for that particular area – that is a very important point. We must protect our sheep-farming industry because to lose more farmers from the industry would have a catastrophic effect on the make-up of rural communities where small family farms play such a vital role.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, there are many who believe that this report does not go far enough in analysing the potential problems facing us as we embark on the revision of the Television without frontiers directive, expected in 2002 as we are all aware. However, it raises some very important issues and it is important to start that dialogue now. My personal concern is the role of public service broadcasters in this important agenda. It is important to recognise that today's public service broadcasting needs to adapt to the changes. Today's radio and TV sector is a competitive one and the market forces which largely govern it cannot be ignored. Public service broadcasters have a crucial role to play in the digital world. Public service broadcasters make programmes of high quality in indigenous languages reflecting indigenous cultures. They also have a crucial role to play in encouraging people to use and understand the new digital media. I agree with the Commissioner's statement in a recent communication that broadcasting and culture should remain within the WTO's services category and that this arrangement should be respected. Having established that, we then need to be absolutely certain that there is sufficient scope for national and EU legislation to protect public services and cultural entities. Robust and determined early regulatory action will be needed to create the open environment we all seek, and one which is in the real interests of all citizens and economies of Europe. Europe has to compete in the digital world where consumers and citizens can wander freely and where competition delivers diversity and choice. With its complementary mix then of private and public service broadcasters, the European audiovisual model guarantees pluralism of information, cultural diversity and access for all to information, education, entertainment and the arts. I will be voting in favour of the report and look forward very much to the forthcoming debates as we look to the future.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I welcome all these reports but will concentrate this morning on the Bösch report, highlighting the very important work carried out by the Ombudsman which goes some way to respecting the idea of transparency and open governance. This will hopefully show citizens that Europe's institutions do endeavour to act in the interests of its people and that cases of maladministration will always be punished. Of course the Ombudsman's powers are limited, but I am happy that the report demonstrates that the Ombudsman does his utmost in most cases in the name of fair play. The bulk of the Ombudsman's report consists of a thorough account of the complaints made to him about maladministration by the European institutions, the investigations his office has carried out and the action taken, including, of course, the results. However many complaints addressed to the Ombudsman still concern actions by national authorities, for which the European Ombudsman is not competent, and many complaints prove not to merit any action. The number of cases where the Ombudsman's intervention has proved successful for the complainant shows that the Ombudsman has developed efficient ways of ensuring that the European institutions comply with his recommendations. The Ombudsman's special reports, based on his right to own-initiative inquiry, make an important contribution to the interpretation and development of Community law. I particularly welcome the fact that, in connection with the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Ombudsman has strongly urged that the Charter recognise the citizen's right to an open, accountable and service-minded administration. Community bodies have a duty to shape Community policies and law in a way which is beneficial and comprehensible to citizens.

 – Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU. It also recognises, importantly, the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its institutions. In December 2001, the Belgian presidency will be concluded by a contribution to this debate at the Laeken Declaration. Will the Laeken Declaration recognise that a further democratisation of the European decision-making process calls for a more radical reform with legislative power vested in two chambers: the European Parliament, and a reformed Council that would subsume some aspects of the present Committee of the Regions and would strongly enhance the role of the constitutional regions?
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, the seven-point plan was proposed, as we are all aware, in response to serious concerns about falling consumer confidence in beef and the resulting pressure on the intervention ceiling. We understand that these concerns have abated somewhat in recent weeks and that consumption forecasts have now improved significantly. If the Commission still believes that emergency measures should be introduced to inhibit over-supply in the beef and veal sector then these changes should not jeopardise the long-term future of the quality, grass-fed beef sector. For this reason we would oppose any alteration to the existing rules for suckler cow premia and beef special premia. Attention should instead – in our view – be focused on the removal of surplus calves from the system. Whilst respecting the aims of Agenda 2000 we would therefore seek renewed justification from the Commission of the need for such radical proposals and would call for the re-evaluation of these measures.

 – Mr President, I welcome the paper on the e
-Learning initiative and congratulate the rapporteur on its content. E
-Learning is becoming increasingly important. Until now perhaps less weight has been given to it in relation to education. It is, however, becoming increasingly apparent that our children's future is indeed a digital future. Therefore preparing for the use of information and communication technologies is becoming increasingly important. The training of teachers in this field is a top priority. I fully support this. But my concern is that once teachers return to their respective schools they return to find that very little ICT facilities are available for them. More often than not they find that they cannot communicate the knowledge acquired through training courses back to the children and make use of ICT in their classes because of lack of resources. Without the necessary tools to meet the aims of the e
-Learning agenda, the goals of the Lisbon Summit will not be achieved. Having no direct jurisdiction over education in the Member States, how will the Commission ensure that these goals are being met and that Member States' governments will provide schools with the necessary equipment to realise these aims? Another problems is that technology is advancing at such a rate that it has become necessary to update computer equipment every few years. This has been, and will be, an added problem for schools working within very tight budgets. It is equally important to make training and education in the information society available to all individuals throughout their lives to realise job opportunities and for personal development as well. This is important and reflects the trend and the decrease in heavy industries in favour of the service industries which rely heavily on digitally-literate personnel. Let us reduce the gap between Europe and the United States. Let us create an e-Europe which is accessible to all.

 – Mr President, in the wake of the implications of FMD for communities directly and indirectly affected by the outbreak, it is vital that we learn the lessons of the mishandling of the outbreak which has caused such devastating knock-on effects for many sectors of society. The consequential loss to those directly and indirectly affected by the disease has so far been enormous: hauliers, abattoirs, tourism, cultural events, schools and the small business sector are all bearing the brunt. Farmers whose stock is not affected directly by FMD, but who are unable to move their stock to markets, are also facing massive losses, further exacerbated by the ban on the sale of cattle over 30 months following the BSE crisis. Commissioner, I learnt from one of my colleagues last week that if the UK were to offer state aid to those affected by the crisis, this would not contravene European Union competition policy. I would appreciate clarification by the Commission on this point. We must also call again for the re-establishment of local abattoirs and a reduction in animal transport over long distances, which undoubtedly acted as a catalyst for the rapid spread.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, a thorough investigation is certainly required into the implications of the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Many considerations arise. Why were infected animals not quarantined at the outset and emergency vaccinations administered instead of adopting a policy of mass slaughter as we have done? I would like to ask the Commission where it stands on the policy of mass slaughter and whether we should differentiate between slaughtering for the welfare of the animal and gratuitous mass slaughter to satisfy the market and media interests. I also call into question once again the transportation of live animals for slaughter over long distances, which increases the risk of the disease spreading. The closure of small abattoirs again needs to be reviewed. Transportation of live animals is currently being investigated by the Commission and I eagerly await the Commission's report on this very important issue and urge the Commission once again to change its policy on the transportation of live animals and to introduce stricter controls. Consequential loss is not covered when discussing the issue of compensation. Does the Commission not agree that it is imperative that we look at the whole picture and evaluate the loss to farmers directly and indirectly affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak as well as the connected industries and tourism? How many more disasters do we have to witness in the agricultural industry before Member State governments agree that the reform of the common agricultural policy is urgently needed?

I welcome the emphasis the document puts on linguistic and cultural diversity and the important contribution of the written word to the development of culture in the different European regions. Seeing that there is much emphasis on linguistic and cultural diversity I trust that references in the report to ‘all languages’ encompasses lesser used languages. E-publishing is especially important for books with a limited market, academic books and books in lesser-used languages are in this category. It is therefore important that the Commission and Council take this into consideration when considering this report.

 – Mr President, I also commend Mr Parish for his hard work and the excellent report. In the brief time I have I wish to stress that one of the greatest difficulties facing young farmers entering the business today is capital and cash-flow problems in the first year of operation. I am backing this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a sound financial footing. After all, young farmers hold the key to the future of all our rural communities. The lack of young people entering the agricultural industry in the UK is a very worrying problem. Statistics show that in Ireland 14.8% of farm owners are under 35, in France the figure is 13.2%, but in the UK it is a mere 6.8%. I stress that farms are also important employers in our rural communities. Employment protects our countryside, it keeps our post offices, schools and services open there. Farming and the viability of farming is the life blood of the future of our rural communities as we know them. If all small businesses – which includes farmers – were to employ just one more person each, then the whole unemployment situation throughout the European Union would be solved overnight. Of all the European Union countries, only the UK and the Netherlands do not operate a specific aid scheme for young farmers. European rural development regulations allow a grant of EUR 16 500 to be made available for people under 40 years of age to establish themselves in a viable farm holding. Yet the Labour government in the UK has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme. I therefore fully support making installation aids mandatory across the European Union. The farming industry needs young blood in order to inject a new vibrancy into an industry which at present is aged and disillusioned. Young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities. I thank Mr Parish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by him in a specific and constructive manner.

 – Mr President, I welcome this document and fully support the European Parliament and Council decision to promote cooperation and quality evaluation in school education. I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion. Education is an important, indeed crucial, part of society. Our education has an impact on all our lives and our communities as well. Recent reports, as those of us from the UK are aware, have tended to criticise the teaching of children at a very young age as this could prove damaging. It would therefore be good to compare and contrast with other European models, within limits of course, as my colleague Mrs Lambert has already stressed. Spain, for example, attaches great importance to social inclusion and developing personalities, working in teams; integrating. These are placed higher on the agenda than academia and at an early age. I also fully agree with better integration between parents, pupils and teachers and the many community players who rightly want to play a role in education and its development and achieve, as a result, the idea of the school as the community. It will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage schools in the different regions to share in good practices. Partnerships between different countries are so important, as indeed are partnerships not only between countries but between rural and urban links. This is part of a very important twinning concept and philosophy that is well established in Europe and is proving such a success throughout all our communities. Networking is so important. I stress that the sharing of good practices and the sharing of information between the different schools in Europe should not develop into a competitive practice. We should at all costs discourage any attempt to create European league table of schools similar to that in the UK that has proved so detrimental. I welcome the report, it is a positive paper and one that we can build on to create better educational networks within the European Union.

 – Mr President, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report. This is a most important topic, especially with a growing ageing population in Europe. The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard. One should emphasise that unity, not only between nations and regions but also between people, is an area in which the European Union has a very proud record, and this report emphasises that fact. Low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the European Parliament should have tackled far earlier. I am very pleased with the emphasis in the report on reviewing the tax and benefit schemes to provide incentives to take up job offers: this is an initiative that is welcome. Promoting life-long learning – a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker – is a matter I also support. With new technology and distance-learning possibilities open to older people, real, new opportunities offer themselves to them and they should be allowed to take advantage of this. On social protection policies: in its work programme for 1999, the Commission paid particular attention to ways to reverse the trend towards early retirement, to explore new forms of gradual retirement and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible. On policies against discrimination and social exclusion: the social action programme sets out the Commission's intentions to explore the possibilities for developing new Community action programmes based on Articles 13, 129 and 139, as modified in Amsterdam, and that is something we all welcome. The attention given to medical and social research related to ageing is an excellent emphasis in the report. Perhaps – and I say this as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport – sport and exercise should have been given more emphasis to keep ageing people fit and healthy – but that is something I am sure the rapporteur is well aware of. I welcome the excellent initiative on the part of the rapporteur and give it every support on behalf of my Group.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, if the European Union is to have any future it needs the supports of its citizens and this can only be achieved if people trust the Union and its institutions. As things stand, the institutions are too often experienced as remote and bureaucratic – something which has had negative repercussions for Parliament as shown, for instance, in the low turnout in the last elections. Taking part in competitions for jobs in the European Union is for many people their first close-up experience of the European institutions. Any doubts concerning the fairness of the competitions must therefore be taken seriously. The fact that these competitions have been surrounded by suspicions of irregularities and favouritism in the media has been quite damaging to the public perception of the institutions. Having good staff and officials is obviously in itself essential for well-functioning institutions and this can only be assured if the recruitment procedure is impartial and as objective as possible. Transparency in the procedure, with due respect for the independence of the boards, is central in this regard. Allowing the candidates to see their marked tests is a simple means of increasing transparency and confidence in the procedure for the recruitment of European civil servants. The Ombudsman's initiative and recommendations can therefore be warmly welcomed, as can the decision by the Commission to follow them. The example should be followed by all other institutions and bodies, as the Committee on Petitions has recommended. It is vital to the construction and administration of a multinational community such as the EU that there should be no suspicions whatever of discrimination between candidates for posts in the administration, whether on national or other grounds. I therefore thank the Ombudsman for his report, which I fully support. I also thank the Commission for having agreed to follow the Ombudsman's recommendation to allow the candidates access to their marked tests in future competitions. I call for all other institutions to follow this example.

 – Mr President, there is no question in my mind that we all want to see the eradication of hooliganism in football at a European level and globally. However, we must be careful not to do so in a manner that would restrict the enjoyment of the real supporters. The issue must, therefore, be discussed at a European level, and we should guard against becoming embroiled in local discussions on the capacity and safety of specific stadiums, wherever they might be. We must ask ourselves why measures taken in the past have repeatedly failed to create a culture of enjoyment in football for everybody. I welcome the dialogue under way now between the Commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve. The people who run the game are the people who, through constructive dialogue, will eventually be able to find answers to the blight of hooliganism and, it must be said, racism affecting this most popular of all sports.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address Parliament on this very important issue. The main thing to stress is that misuse of funds in one place should not prevent innovation continuing in other areas. Excellent schemes are already being developed and should be supported. In an unstable agricultural industry, the opportunities offered by flax and hemp in a developing market for natural fibres should not be lost. It will provide farmers with the opportunity to diversify – something that they have continually been urged to do by respective Member State governments and by the European Parliament – to produce new employment possibilities. In my own nation, Wales, flax processing plants are already being established using European Union aid. The report from our Agricultural Committee also includes amendments to extend grant aid for producing flax and hemp to non-arable land, thus providing opportunities to diversify areas of the European Union unable to obtain monetary support under the present regime. This is a crucial matter as it affects thousands of hectares of European land with low productive possibilities. For example, 80% of the land mass of my nation, Wales, is non-arable. The higher than average incidence of rainfall there makes it ideal terrain for growing short-fibre flax and yet it could not apply for European Union support under prior regulations. Its peripheral location, something which has already been stressed here from other areas, and its small family farm units having to compete in a wider market, coupled with the high value of sterling, has meant that it has lost 80% of its income in less than three years. The importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the European Union cannot be overemphasised. I would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments in this regard. We also reject quotas and a ceiling for this production, as this would limit the possibilities to develop diversification and employment possibilities in disadvantaged regions. We also believe there should be a balance of support between farmers and processors. The rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, has agreed to put a limit of EUR 600 per hectare to farmers directly, provided that the farmer proves to the competent authorities, within 18 months after having applied for the subsidy, that he has delivered the fibre to a processor. We also agreed if this proof could not be provided to the competent authorities within that period, the subsidy should stay at the level of the premia for set-aside land. I congratulate the rapporteur and call on the European Parliament to support the Agriculture Committee's report.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 in writing
. –
 The reason for this intervention is to clarify why this House should oppose the Commission’s proposals to cut subsidies for school milk by half. I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this House rejected these proposals by bringing forward these amendments not to cut the subsidies at all and I urge everyone to support these amendments. There are several arguments for doing so. By nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support. But also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past.
Wyn (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in the debate and I congratulate the rapporteur for his work. One clear result, of course, of the proposal before us to curtail or remove this subsidy on school milk will be decreased availability of milk and a drop in the consumption of milk in schools. I ask you sincerely: is that what you want to see happening? The nutritional aspect is surely the central element here and the continuation of the consumption of milk by schoolchildren is what we should be working towards. The proposals before us definitely militate against that. Can I suggest to you what might happen as a result. There are two possibilities. Children will switch to consuming non-nutritional products or, God forbid, we will move closer towards a situation where children will have to pay for milk consumed, thus discriminating against poor children from deprived communities. We all acknowledge the aim here. It is to cut milk subsidies. But to use schoolchildren as the means towards that end is a sinister way to go about it, especially in a world that is becoming far more health-conscious by the day. This is the age of non-GM food and organic products, and the proposals before us represent a major step backwards. Let us be clear. Several Member States will not operate this scheme at all if the present subsidy is withdrawn or decreased. That is the reality of the situation. This would be a catastrophe, not only for the health of schoolchildren – our future citizens – but to the viability of communities also. I come from a part of Wales, where GDP per head of the population is less than 75% of the European Union average, in other words, an Objective 1 area. I am not proud of that. It is an indication of our deprived status. Cutting the subsidy, however, would make my community even poorer, a community whose farmers have lost 80% of their income in 2½ years. This is not the European Union that I thought my nation had joined. We were looking to a Europe of cohesion that seeks to bolster its deprived communities and help its poorest citizens. There is also the misconception that Member States will somehow foot this bill and make up the deficit on the basis that it is their responsibility to deal with health and social policy. Can I tell you that my Member State, the UK, is already prevaricating on the provision of additional money for Wales and for Scotland to match European funds, a point that I and my colleagues have already highlighted previously in this Chamber. This is not unique to my nation. Sadly, it affects other nations as well. Farmers then are told to diversify, to become multifunctional. These are the buzzwords now in the European Union. Yet they have already diversified. They have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible. It is time we rewarded them, particularly in the peripheral and deprived communities of the European Union. Cutting this subsidy would destroy an industry already on its knees. We need to give a window of opportunity to these people and provide them with the assistance to sustain themselves as they undoubtedly face the most difficult period economically they have ever faced. It is clear to me that the proposals before us are not merely a means to curtail the subsidy, but rather, in the event of a lack of participation by Member States in the wake of the subsidy cut, to terminate it entirely. This continued erosion of the milk industry is, I am afraid, part of a general trend that we are witnessing throughout the agricultural industry. Without people farming in our villages and communities, there will be no rural communities; nobody left to service the needs of those of us that sometimes visit rural areas for recreation. The process of amalgamating farms and the buying-up of farm units by consortia pushing up prices unrealistically is already well advanced in my nation of Wales and is becoming the sad pattern in other regions and nations as well. I believe we should call a halt to this general erosion of our rural communities. At the present moment in time, that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies. Defending communities is far, far more important. We must keep our milk farmers farming and the communities where they earn their living as viable entities. The Agricultural Committee deserve every support in this regard. Mr Maat has done well in a very difficult situation and I wish him every success.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, I also commend the report and thank Mrs Gröner for the excellent effort she has made. It is a very good report. Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored. Indeed in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport it is the “Cinderella” sector of funding, as with sport. We hope that imbalance will be redressed. The insufficient commitment to youth affairs from the Council, when the European Parliament was calling for EUR 980 million, shows, in my view, this grave disparity and the lack of commitment on the part of the Council to a very important sector. The danger, in this regard, with the changes that are proposed, of combining two programmes – Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service – is that several good parts of both those programmes might be lost. I hope that does not happen. We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future. The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries. That is an excellent initiative. The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe. The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome. When more funds are needed, budgets should not be cast in stone but be flexible so that they can be amended in the best interests of the deserving needs of youth. What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union.
Wyn (Verts/ALE

 – Mr President, one of the main problems arising in this whole issue is that there is not any legal sanction from Europe to ensure that Member States adhere to the excellent concept of additionality. I think we must look in detail at that problem, and we need also better coordination between DGs on this issue. Additionality is your
 concept, and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in Member States. We understand as well, of course, the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes, creating problems of continuity for you. Verification is another matter that needs to be tackled with Member States, because they are guilty as well. We understand your problems, that they are not providing for you sufficient data in good time, especially with Objectives 2, 3 and 4, to enable you to ensure that the system works more effectively. One of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK. No additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly. This is clear non-compliance. The European Parliament and the European Union admit that our nation of Wales is poor and yet the UK government, not only the Labour government, has not complied with additionality. It is all very well for my colleague Jonathan Evans to imply that his party is not guilty. For eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either. I think some momentum is being lost, Mr President. I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday. They need this scheme to go ahead. It is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion, and we ask the Commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the European Union.
Wyn (Verts/ALE
). 
 – Mr President, what has not been stressed sufficiently thus far in the debate I believe is democracy and subsidiarity. Many of the atrocities in the Balkans that we spoke of earlier and much of the racism and antisemitism is because communities everywhere have not been allowed the ability, in line with the concept of subsidiarity, to develop within their own communities the democracy that people need everywhere if they are to evolve and create within their own regions and nations, the social rights, justice, respect for minorities, coexistence of different people and respect for every race and people. Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty, President, still confines subsidiarity to the relationship between the European Union and the Member States. Regions and stateless nations are ignored. People within their own communities therefore suffer. They are unable to establish the structures they need so that human rights can prosper and the blight of racism can be forever removed. In own nation, Wales, for example, we have no empowerment to establish our own laws to counter racism and defend human rights. The principles of cohesion and the drive to limit poverty and depravity in our communities are a well-settled concept in the European Union. However, it must encompass respect for minorities everywhere if it to inspire the world in its drive towards defeating racism and defending human rights.

 – Mr President, I would like to touch on one aspect of cultural diversity needing support: minority languages. Europe should take pride in its linguistic diversity. The European Union has done much to promote its wealth of cultures and I congratulate Commissioner Reding on her work in this regard. Many in this new Parliament might not remember that in May 1998 budget lines for minority languages were frozen because they had no legal basis. Will the Commission now guarantee that a legal basis for these projects is introduced? The situation of 1998 cannot be allowed to arise again. Lesser-used languages must be granted the funding they deserve, otherwise excellent innovative projects – drama, the translating of literature following the end of the Ariane project – the teaching of languages and so on will all suffer. As a Welsh speaker, I have seen the significant benefits of European funding but also the threat to many excellent projects when financial support is withdrawn. As the budget has already been frozen for 16 months it is unlikely that any schemes under the Culture 2000 programme will come into being until 2001. It is crucial therefore that the Commission uses its preparatory measures to ensure that current projects do not now suffer. Languages are more than mere words. They are the vehicles by which the cultures of Europe are expressed and celebrated also. Let us hope that Commissioner Reding’s words become reality and that every language is respected and promoted regardless of the numbers who speak it.

 – Mr President, I am pleased to support this initiative on behalf of the European Free Alliance/Green Group in Parliament. We thank Mrs Kinnock for her efforts. Inter-state and, more recently, inter-regional alliances both within the European Union and with partners outside is an initiative we can pride ourselves on developing enthusiastically. Funding schemes such as INTERREG, PHARE and others are a clear expression of this ideology. This initiative of itself cannot be expected to resolve overnight, as it were, the problems of economic deprivation in the new South Africa. It has to address massive domestic problems including social integration, chronically poor housing for the majority of the population, massive unemployment and an economy that produces only 0.46% of world GDP. The concern of most South Africans is that our initiatives take so long before coming to fruition. We must ensure that all support schemes can be expedited far quicker than at present. An agreement that provides for the full liberalisation of 95% of South African exports to the EU over a ten-year period with tariffs eliminated on 86% of its industrial goods is a very long time to wait for a country facing such acute economic and social problems. Tariff restrictions are fine, but should be viewed in the context of the restrictions on third world countries exporting to the developed world being four times as stringent as the tariffs we face when we export to them. Inter-regional relationships must also be fostered with South Africa, a country of regions. The role that the regions and historical nations of the EU can have in building economic and cultural links with the diverse regions of Africa is vital and should be an essential prerequisite to its future prospects, as will the elimination of its debt. The decision of the World Economic Summit in Cologne this year to cancel $100 billion of third world debt was important in this regard and should be a catalyst for further action by all EU countries, not just the few. Financial partnership is not the panacea that will cure the problems of South Africa as a whole. A whole raft of issues that are crucial to the task of ensuring that South Africa is in a position to maximise the opportunities afforded by this agreement now need to be explored in a holistic way. The EU should be looking to develop strategies and training programmes to ensure that the regeneration of the South African economy is sustainable in the long term both economically and environmentally. I welcome this initiative.
