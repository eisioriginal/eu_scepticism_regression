 Mr President, your words today were typical of your time as President. Our groups may not always agree, but during your mandate you have proven an honest, fair and unifying figure, one whose modesty masks your many achievements. You were elected on the basis of a worthy pledge to engage our House in intercultural dialogue but your record reaches further than that. On Members’ allowances, you concluded the vital work started by Pat Cox. On parliamentary procedures, you oversaw the reforms that many of us have long called for and, through initiatives like Europarl TV, you have supported modern methods of communicating with our citizens. That is a record to be proud of and a legacy on which your successors should build. I hope you will write about your experiences and impressions. They will be too interesting to be left in the cold and powerful hands of oblivion. Moreover, as the poet Emerson taught us, there is no such thing as history, only biography. This Parliament has become more powerful over the years. It will be more powerful still under the Lisbon Treaty, if and when it is eventually ratified. It will be interesting to see what plans future presidents will bring to expand on the role that you have played, projecting the common values and principles that we hold dear. But today I think I can speak for many when I say that you have earned our respect and affection. Like you, this is my last plenary speech in my current role. Having led my group since 2002, I have a touch of what we call in English the seven-year itch. Although I will not sit in this seat again, I know you are aware that I am keen to try sitting where you are. President, on behalf of my group, I thank you. I thank the session services and the interpreters and all the staff who have contributed to the very fine job you have done as President of our House. (Applause)

 Mr President, we approach the next European Council with anxiety tempered by ambition. One important item on the agenda should, of course, be the nomination of the next President of the Commission, but that nomination cannot be seen in isolation. The President is underpinned by the Commissioners and, in the light of the Lisbon stalemate, we are none the wiser on how those posts will be filled. So, when we ask the citizens of Europe to choose their new parliamentarians in just four weeks’ time, we do so on the basis of uncertainty and we run the risk of that vacuum being filled by the opportunism of Europe’s opponents. The time has come to make clear how we will proceed. Mr Daul has expressed his determination that the largest group should propose the President of the Commission, as was the case five years ago. My group follows that logic. The next President of the Commission, whenever he or she is appointed, must know the legal basis and the timeframe for the appointment of the College of Commissioners. The logical approach is to make all the appointments on the basis of Nice or all on the basis of Lisbon. That is the kind of certainty citizens need. Those Member States yet to ratify the Lisbon Treaty should act to make that deal easier to strike. Tomorrow the Czech Senate will vote on the Treaty, with a three-fifths majority required. Assuming its assent, the document will be delivered to Mr Klaus’s desk. He should sign it forthwith. President-in-Office, your Presidency has not been bad. As Mr Barroso said, a number of legislative acts have successfully been brought to conclusion, but the headline facts – despite the best efforts of you and your team, Mr Vondra, and we wish you well – are that we have had the first Eurosceptic Council President and the collapse of a government half way through the Presidency. Also, I am sorry to remind you of it, but it may take some time to forget the Entropa
 sculpture, no matter how much we may want to. So, when the President replaces the Prime Minister in the summit chair, let him end his term of office on a positive point. Let him confirm his signature of the Lisbon Treaty. For all that Lisbon matters, it will not define this European election campaign. Europe’s voters are interested less in constitutional questions than in practical solutions to the problems they face, and I urge you at your summit to recognise these problems. Europe’s economy continues to creak under the weight of recession, and citizens need to know how we will lighten that load. My group welcomes the hedge fund proposals from the Commission in that regard as a good first step. Europe’s environment remains in peril as climate chaos draws ever closer and voters must see that the European Union can lead the fight back. Europe’s values are undermined by human rights abuses occurring on our doorstep, and people should understand that the European Union retains its resolve to right those wrongs. These are the challenges of our times. This election campaign must show that Europe is up to the task and that Europe alone is equipped to do so.

 Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of colleagues to the presence in the gallery today of the leaders of the three opposition parties represented in Moldova’s Parliament, who are here for this debate: Dorin Chirtoacă, who is the Mayor of Chişinău and the Vice-President of the Liberal Party of Moldova; Vladimir Filat, who is the President of the Liberal Democratic Party, and Serafim Urechean, the President of the Alliance ‘Our Moldova’. (Applause)

 Madam President, Moldova’s state brings back miserable memories of Europe’s unhappy past: a Communist government declaring victory on its own terms, protesters beaten and killed, accusations that neighbours are orchestrating unrest. If there is real evidence that the Romanian Security Service has stoked violence, then that should be subject to scrutiny by the international community. This Parliament’s mission next week must seek evidence regarding reports of 200 000 additional ballots printed, allegations that 400 000 voters registered on election day with inadequate ID, and claims that voters in Transnistria were disenfranchised en masse. Until those are investigated, until the OSCE reports, many will simply not believe the results, whatever Moldova’s courts conclude. It may be that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s instinctive optimism proves misplaced. President Voronin should also denounce the detention, beatings and extrajudicial killing of young people randomly rounded up after the protests. No more obstacles to lawyers or NGOs, no more withholding the names and numbers of those detained. I would like the Commission to confirm whether Moldova’s expulsion of Romania’s Ambassador and demand for visas from travellers breaks the agreements our Union has with that country. If so, what action will the Commission take? President Băsescu’s announcement on passports also added to tensions. We must show sensitivity to bilateral relations but, nonetheless, insist agreements are honoured. Our Moldovan visitors today describe a country where, in so many ways, freedom and democracy are denied, where the Internet mysteriously malfunctions, where television channels vanish from the airwaves, where state TV broadcasts belly dancing rather than reporting violence on the streets. Our Union, while mindful of the geopolitics, must understand the politics of Moldova, a people keen to exercise democracy and freedom of choice, a country trading overwhelmingly with the countries to its west, a land linked to Member States of the Union through geography, history and culture. Next month, as our leaders gather for the Eastern Partnership summit, they should make sure they build partnership on the basis of democracy and human rights. President Voronin and his comrades must commit to that cause. Our Union must demand it.

 Mr President, foreign affairs demands diplomacy and principle, and this report on a new EU-Russia agreement provides both. My group commends its content and congratulates Janusz Onyszkiewicz on his work. History teaches us that nothing riles the Russians more than turning our backs to them, so it is in the interests of both Russia and the European Union to communicate, cooperate and trade in ways that build trust. Equally, it is dishonest to pretend that Russia’s conduct is beyond reproach. This is a country that uses energy supplies as a weapon, a country whose cavalier conduct in the Caucasus and the Baltics sets its neighbours’ nerves on edge, and a country where the rule of law flexes and bends to accommodate those in favour with the Kremlin, and turns the screws on those who are not, as today’s new trial against Mikhail Khodorkovsky confirms. Elections, as we know, are no exception. Physical abuse, the intimidation of human rights advocates, the murder of independent journalists – Mr Tabajdi, these are the realities of Russia today. (Applause)
 We are saddened that some Members have set their sights on watering down criticism of Russia’s human rights record. I am surprised at the insistence of some on defining the new agreement as strategic, simply because Moscow wants it. Yes, we should build bridges, but we must not be uncritical of things that are unspeakable. There are three reasons to explain why some are prone to pander to Mr Putin. First, there are those who once sympathised with the Soviets and whose sentimental attachment to the Kremlin continues. Second, there are those who think that Russia is somehow different from other countries and the same standards cannot apply and, third, there are those who think that Russia is just too scary to scorn. None of these arguments holds water. Europe’s hard Left has a history of wilful ignorance about human rights in the Soviet era. It is not only morally wrong, but politically muddle-headed for them to make excuses for Russia now that she is moving towards the authoritarian right. Moreover, human rights are universal and indivisible, or they mean nothing; so the Union should have the confidence to defend our values within our borders and outwith them. Lastly, Europe today has a population three and a half times the size of Russia’s. We have military spending that is ten times bigger, and an economy fifteen times the size. We have no reason to cower from the Kremlin, and every reason to stand up for our values. We therefore support a new agreement, but let Europe enter that relationship united, strong and with its eyes open.
 Graham Watson,

 Mr President, for all the real suffering there is a light-hearted definition of recession. It is when you go to your bank machine to withdraw money and a sign flashes saying: ‘Insufficient funds available’– and you are not sure if it means yours or theirs! (Laughter)
 For all the dark warnings about splits and strife, this European Council has produced a positive package and I congratulate the Czech Presidency on that achievement. We have a pledge of more money from the IMF, a promise of more support for Europe’s most troubled economies and an agreement on moving ahead with European supervision of the financial system. All these are welcome. And I was particularly pleased to see that the Council has saved Mr Barroso’s bacon by transferring five billion unspent euros into the recovery plan. Investment in transport, infrastructure and broadband connections will create jobs now and prepare Europe for the future. Meanwhile, money going to the Nabucco pipeline will ease our troubling energy reliance on Russia. We need a clear assurance from the President-in-Office that funds from the EUR 5 billion will actually reach that project, but also that investment in gas supply infrastructure will not be a substitute for renewables research. Green growth remains essential for our citizens’ security now and in the future, and so do the principles embodied in the Lisbon Strategy: flexicurity, the knowledge-based economy, employment regulations that are fit for purpose – these are key to a competitive economy and a successful single market. It is to the Council’s great credit that the protectionist language of the past cast no shadow over its conclusions. But for all the apparent agreement, a niggling nuance remains over Member States’ priorities. On the one hand, we have those who focus on robust regulation at international level, and on the other, those who lay stress on a strong stimulus package. This is a false choice. Of course we need supervisory structures with real regulatory bite, but so too do we need counter-cyclical measures to deal with the realities of recession. The long term and the short term: both must be addressed. Our leaders must be clear about that at the G20 Summit. If we cannot agree on our common cause then we cannot hope to punch at our collective weight. America will come to the G20 with her own agenda. We must arrive with ours and together reach a deal that delivers for all. President-in-Office, last week at the Council you barely discussed the legal basis on which the next Commission will be formed, but it is no longer only Ireland which is unlikely to ratify Lisbon. I therefore urge you to convene the leaders of Council, Commission and Parliament before this House rises in May to agree on how to compose Parliament and Commission with legal certainty. There is a moment, President-in-Office, in the famed melody in Smetana’s Má Vlast
, where cello and bassoon rise in crescendo from lugubrious depths to reach a seemingly impossible high note. That moment has passed for your Government. For Europe it is yet to come. See to it that domestic difficulties do not sap your stride. (Applause)

 Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister on this, the first leg, of the ‘Brown G20 World Tour’. You have sketched a big agenda for the G20, Prime Minister, from combating world poverty to nuclear disarmament, to peace in the Middle East, and I wish you success. My group congratulates you and your colleagues in the European Council for mapping out the contours of a common approach, albeit on a more limited agenda, to the summit next week. Opportunities to work with the Obama Administration should not be spoilt by a transatlantic war of words. I know we share that view, but America retains its affection for skeletal regulation, and the reality of this recession shows that those who wilfully ignored bad practice are now suffering most. We need a European financial services authority. By all means press others to support the same standards, but caution from them cannot condone inaction from us. As you say, we need to lock honesty, transparency and the rule of law into the financial system. Reform of global financial institutions is necessary too, to stop current account surpluses and excess liquidity fuelling global boom and bust. We need the IMF to fill that role. Can it assemble more assets with increased access to crisis funds? Should it become a real asset manager for parts of the global savings pool, second-guessing speculators, preventing panic, stabilising markets? How can we reform its decision-making structures to reflect the demand for more democratic oversight and the power of emerging economies? It is crucial too, despite the pain of recession, to confront the challenge of climate change and the problems posed by poverty. Prime Minister, you spoke about the need for action, so will you give the IMF and the World Bank an explicit mandate to tackle the drought, flooding and disease that accompany global warming in the developing world? Will you make sure they grant, lend and plan not just for market success, but to achieve social progress and green goals too? We need a new and sustainable economy enshrined in a global social contract. The era of easy money is past. For future growth, making a living must not equate to making a killing. But to achieve these things Europe must marshal consensus, and the UK must be part of it. Prime Minister, you and I carry different colours from the political pallet, but as fellows Scots with a burning belief in progressive politics, I know that we both understand Burns when he wrote: ‘Oh would some Power the gift to give us, to see ourselves as others see us’. And those parties pushing themselves and Britain to the sidelines of Europe will cost their country dear. So let Britain be a positive partner, cast in the European mould. Prime Minister, I expect the single currency to emerge stronger from this crisis. In the chill winds of recession, investors have sheltered under the euro’s wing. You designed five byzantine tests that prevented British entry these past 10 years. Will you now work to bring the United Kingdom into the euro in the post-recession period? The UK should not stand back to the wall while others take to the floor. This is a dance that Britain should join. (Loud applause)
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group. 
– Mr President, over recent months, our Union has had more summits than our former colleague Reinhold Messner, and our Parliament has had a string of reports on improving the economy, but what those summits and those reports have done is provide Member States with stepping stones across the river of recession. Now we need the Council to cross without fear or flight, and I congratulate the authors of the Andersson, Ferreira and Kirilov reports. They offer a consistent and pragmatic perspective written in the light of the unemployment avalanche on our horizon. And their underlying message is this: jobs, jobs, jobs. The Lisbon Strategy, employment guidelines, cohesion policy – these have always argued for flexicurity in our economies, for public investment in research and development, for the rapid transition to the knowledge economy. They are the foundations on which a healthy, dynamic and secure job market is built. And from today’s vantage point, one thing is clear to everyone – except, perhaps, some on the benches to the left. It was not the Lisbon Strategy that brought hardship to our kitchen tables, rather it is the Member States which ignored it that are suffering the deepest and will suffer the longest. So now is the time to put our foot on the floor and drive forward a ‘Lisbon plus programme’ and employment guidelines that reflect the realities of our Union. National parliaments, regional governments, city halls: each must be empowered to rise to that challenge, and named and shamed when they do not. Nor should we accept heel-dragging over the need to protect the planet. The Council will consider the EU’s negotiating stance for the Copenhagen climate conference. Just how much money, Mr Vondra, will the 27 allot to adaptation and mitigation in the developing world? Climate change will not stop as the economy slows, and the poorest countries will suffer – still – from our carbon consumption. So recession must not mean inaction. Member States must commit the cash to counter climate change and to create green-collar jobs in the process, perhaps by using the money we have, as Claude Turmes suggests, to leverage more through the EIB or the EIF. However, the Council knows that the ravages of recession will return without root and branch reform of the financial system. Next month’s G20 is tasked with recasting the mould, and I welcome the tone taken by European leaders when they met in Berlin. The IMF should be financed effectively, tax havens should be subject to scrutiny, and financial institutions should be regulated robustly, with an effective European financial services authority overseeing the system: not to drag our economies back into the past, but to create an open, honest and transparent system of trade that is free and fair. London, Paris, Berlin: each is keen to stress that Europe stands united, but the President of the Council tells us that differences persist. I hope the President of the Council will be here to report back to us from this summit, because he should be here today. If differences persist, it will not do. We need Europe to be strong in mind, fleet of foot and united in purpose over the weeks and months ahead, ready to strip out the toxic assets that are crippling bank balances, ready to reform bank practice to restore creditworthiness, and ready to accept that the current stimulus package may not be enough, because it is no good topping up the IMF if there is no global financial system to support, and while it is rough justice that responsible Member States must mitigate against default by those who lived it up, that may be the price to pay to avoid the contagion of economic meltdown. Put simply, we need Council, Commission and Parliament to work together: coolly, calmly, collectively, preventing procedure from getting the better of purpose. Europe can fight fire no longer. The time has come for the fundamental reform that will provide jobs now and security in the future.

 – Mr President, I seek clarification. Is it the case that the President has ruled that we will apply the recast procedure to the vote on the Krahmer report today and the vote on the Cashman report tomorrow? If that is the case, my group requests that we delay the vote on the Krahmer report until tomorrow, so that we can investigate the implications of the application of the recast procedure to that vote.
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – Mr President, if I understood you correctly, you are indicating that the presidency does wish to apply the recast procedure to the Krahmer report today and the Cashman report. In that case, my group requests that we delay the vote until tomorrow so that we can study the implications of this.
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – Mr President, it is with heavy hearts that we debate once again what our Union can do to ease the pain in the Middle East. Looking at the recent conflict in Gaza, all the old familiar phrases apply: blame on both sides; provocation by Hamas; disproportionate response by Israel. But in the face of the recurring violence, we have recycled those tired phrases so often that they have lost whatever impact they once had. We cannot go on like this. Of course, it is our moral duty to assist in the reconstruction of Gaza. Of course, it makes sense to seek safeguards from Israel. It is bad enough to see the airport, schools and sewerage systems blown up; it is worse to rebuild them with European money knowing that they will likely be destroyed once again. Is it possible, is it credible, to imagine that Israel can assure us that this will not happen? In any event, reconstruction and humanitarian aid from the European Union will not prevent future conflict. We need a new and positive approach, jointly with the United States, if possible, but without them if not. Last month’s violence and the outcome of this month’s election have changed the terms of the debate. Hamas is stronger politically, it is intact militarily, it is holding out against recognising Israel, and the expected coalition in Israel will be more hard-line than ever and broadly resistant to seeing a separate Palestinian state. Meanwhile, the gulf between the West Bank and Gaza grows ever wider, with the threat of a permanent division. The Council and the Commission have not really said what their response will be to this turn of events, and the Czech Presidency appears to want the matter off the agenda, but we can afford to wait no longer. With the situation in flux and neither Hamas nor the Israelis talking to one another, we must set achievable terms on which we can talk to both. Isolation has led only to despair. The time has come for diplomacy, delicate but determined. In which forum? In the Quartet, Mr Solana? Well, perhaps, but let us first acknowledge that the policy failures, the dashed hopes and the creeping extremism of the past seven years have taken place under the Quartet’s watch. Its envoy, Tony Blair, has never even been to Gaza. If he went there, he could visit the site of the industrial area, which is one of his pet projects, designed to generate jobs, but levelled last month. (Applause)
 The Quartet has to open its mind to a new approach and, if our partners within it cannot take that step, then we should explore ways in which it might. Lastly, we can only prepare for the future if we acknowledge honestly what has happened in the past. There should be a free and fair international investigation into alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict. The UNRWA and our own parliamentary committee have both reported alarming evidence of war crimes, and the allegations are serious indeed. If Israel is wrongly accused, its name should be cleared, but if it has committed those crimes, it must face up to its responsibilities. Our aim must be to forge an agreement for a peaceful and prosperous future on both sides of the divide, where enemies can once again become partners. However, the failure of our approach to date is written in spilled blood on the ground. Mr Solana, we must pioneer a new path to peace, and the European Union, if necessary, must take the lead. (Applause)
 Graham Watson,

 – Mr President, when Senator Obama became President Obama, we all heaved a sigh of relief. The axis of evil, regime change, the war on terror: European citizens yearn to see those euphemisms consigned to history, along with the people who invented them. But breaking with the past and reverting to the rule of law take guts and grit, so I congratulate the new President. He was right to condemn waterboarding as torture, right to call a halt to the flawed military trials at Guantánamo Bay, and right to signal his determination to close the camp completely within a year. I welcome the assurance of the Council Presidency today that the US has now disowned all the squalid practices that have tarnished its Government over recent years, including torture in third countries and extraordinary rendition, in order to put an end to the axis of illegality. However, Europe cannot stand back, shrug its shoulders and say that these things are for America alone to sort out. We lack the open debate and the collective change of will which American democracy allows. Yet, too often, Member States from our Union were complicit in what the Bush Administration did. If the 43rd 
President taught us anything, it is this: that in the administration of international justice, the ‘go it alone’ mentality ends in a cul-de-sac of failure. So the challenge of Guantánamo, the problem posed by 245 suspects floating outwith the justice system, is not an issue for America alone. It is a conundrum we must solve together. The United States must prosecute suspects, where sound evidence exists and in accordance with the rule of law. America must free those suspects against whom there is insufficient evidence and defend them if they are likely to face torture at home. But what about those who are released, who pose no threat, but who have no wish to remain in a country that wrongly imprisoned them? If asked, should not Europe offer those few citizens the rights and freedoms that no other country will? We cannot forever balance the Council’s assertion that it is for individual Member States to decide with the Council’s stated desire for a coordinated European position. Europe has to speak with one voice and play its part in ending this affront to justice. Many of us have criticised America in the past for its failure to work with others. We were right to do so, but our help may now be sought and we would be wrong to say ‘no’.

 Mr President, last year’s energy review was a timely update, and I congratulate Anne Laperrouze for her rigorous report on it. The issues raised are highly complex, but we can boil them down to this: Europe needs an energy policy that gives us sustainable, affordable and secure resources of energy. Sustainable by breaking our umbilical dependence on the fossil fuels that are choking our planet; affordable by guaranteeing a stable and realistic cost to consumers; and secure by freeing European citizens from dependence on unreliable or monopolistic suppliers. This Friday, a group of Commissioners will meet Prime Minister Putin and his team of ministers. Energy is on the agenda, and our side should make clear that we cannot tolerate a dispute between Russia and Georgia evolving into a European gas crisis in the depths of winter. Assurances should be sought, but notice should also be served. This has happened before, and it must not happen again. The time has come fundamentally to reassess Europe’s energy supplies. This view is shared by members of all groups in this House, who should unite in leading the charge to make it happen. That is why this week a small group of us, including Mr Hammerstein, who will speak later, will launch a cross-party pamphlet, Making the Green Energy Switch at a Time of Crisis
. I am grateful to all Members who contributed their ideas, and I am startled by the degree of consensus that exists. There is an appetite in this Chamber to work fast, to work together, in search of a lasting solution to Europe’s energy crisis, and we must harness that. Of all the potential plans to open up a new energy era, one stands out: it is called the supergrid, or DESERTEC. The French Presidency cited it as a possible operation project for our new European Union for the Mediterranean. A number of Members, including Ms Harms, recently visited southern Spain to see the technology in action: solar thermal power from North Africa and sun-rich land in southern Europe harvesting energy from the sun, generating the equivalent of one and a half million barrels of oil per square kilometre per year. Transported through energy-efficient, high-voltage direct current cables, that power could be fed into a European supergrid, taking renewable energy from across the EU – tidal power from coastal regions, wind and wave power from windswept north-western Europe, and biomass and geothermal power from wherever they flourish. Upfront, there are costs. The German Aerospace Centre estimates it would cost EUR 45 billion to build, but it also says that it would save consumers many times that amount in reduced energy bills over the next 35 years, and the investment would create thousands of jobs. This is a bold project for an energy future that is sustainable, affordable and secure. That is the energy future that Europe must champion.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I welcome the President-in-Office. We wish you success, President-in-Office. A great Czech once said: ‘I am no longer a rookie: goals are expected of me; scoring is my job.’ Well, what was true for Milan Baroš is also true for you and your ministers. Your work programme outlines those goals. On the economy, you have said that barriers to the market – internal and external – must come down, and that Europe’s answer to recession must not be Keynesian spending alone, but that we must strive for fairer competition, trade liberalisation, and freer movement of people and goods across national boundaries. These are hard times for Europe’s citizens. Your recipe will be contested, but not by Liberals and Democrats. For the experience of the Czech Republic – and so many others – proves the power of markets in lifting people out of poverty. On energy, you are right to pursue the aims of the Strategic Energy Review, but the Review and our climate change targets should not be a ceiling to our ambitions, rather a springboard to greater and greener heights, to force the pace on Europe’s switch from fossil fuels to renewables and put an end to our umbilical energy dependence. Currently, our monitors are blocked from Ukrainian dispatch centres. Russia claims it cannot export gas because Ukraine will not transport it, and Ukraine claims it has no gas to export because the Russians have switched the transit route. Meanwhile, industry across eastern and central Europe is suffering, some people are freezing in their homes, and there are moves to reopen nuclear reactors condemned as unsafe by our Union. That is not a functioning energy market. It is the plot of a Marx Brothers’ film: A Night in the Cold
 – or, rather, twelve nights and counting. So stop talking about the internal market in energy and the development of renewals: use your presidency’s powers to mobilise the necessary investment. On the EU in the world, we welcome your presidency’s ambitions. Europe should play a leading role in resolving conflicts, supporting development and promoting human rights. But, if you truly seek to widen the EU’s capacity to act, why have you delayed yet again ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon? If you want to prevent weapons proliferation, why are you building a ballistic missile defence system on European soil? (Applause)
 And if you want peace in the Middle East, why allow Europe to be ridiculed by so many different peace missions? As events unfold in Gaza, it becomes harder for many of us to remain detached. This House will never unite around a common position if we seek to apportion blame precisely, but fault can be found on both sides, violence denounced, and an immediate ceasefire sought. There is no excuse for Hamas rocket attacks, but nor for the use of dense inert metal explosives to maim civilians. The tag line for your Presidency is ‘Europe without Borders’. Perhaps its author had in mind that old Czech proverb: ‘Protect yourself not by fences but by your friends’. President-in-Office, we, your fellow Europeans, are your friends. Your country’s President compared the European Union to the Soviet Union. Well, we do not bug private discussions, as he did to Members of this House. He who wishes to remain on the margin is free to do so. But this is a Union of friends – friends, equals and partners. Your presidency’s aims are bold. We support them. Stick to them, and we will stick by you. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Carl Schlyter, and the shadow rapporteurs, on the very thorough and professional work that they have done on this dossier. It is a rare pleasure for me these days to be able to participate in debates arising from committee work and particularly at this time of day, or should I say at this time of night. I have not had the privilege to participate in the debates in committee other than on one occasion when I wished to ensure that my colleagues understood the importance of voting to support the rapporteur’s proposals. But this is an important issue, indeed an issue of life or death, and one that for me is doubly important because I have a particular constituency interest in it. Dichloromethanes, as we have heard, are substances with a uniquely hazardous profile. They are so volatile that inhalation, even just the casual smell of them, is above all recognised health limits. They are carcinogenic and they cause neurotic effects with nerve damage. Under normal temperatures their use causes them to evaporate to dangerous levels. To work safely with dichloromethanes one needs an air-proof suit at a cost of about EUR 2 000, and to protect one’s skin, gloves at a cost of EUR 25 or EUR 30, which need to be replaced every two or three hours. Of course nobody does this, even if they know of the harmful nature of the substance. There is no effective way to ensure the safe use of dichloromethanes for the public. And, because they are so toxic, the rapporteur and the committee wanted to ban them, even for professional use, in order to prevent fatalities. Over the last eight years the Commission has on record some 18 fatalities from the use of these products and some 56 non-fatal injuries. I am sure that in reality there have been more. But there has been an industrial lobby which has created a blocking minority in Council, and for that reason the rapporteur and the committee reluctantly agreed to allow the Member States a derogation for professional use. However, we have achieved not only strict protection for workers using them professionally, but also a commitment to control and inspection by the Member States. A complete ban on these products already exists in Sweden, Denmark and Germany, and I hope no Member State will ask for such a derogation. Industrial use is a different matter. These products can be used safely industrially in the right conditions. Some Members have argued that they should be allowed to be used for the protection of cultural heritage, for the removal of paint from old monuments without damaging. But experts have suggested this would not be a good idea, and therefore my group will not be supporting any amendments tabled in that direction. I mentioned that I have a constituency interest in this. I have been in correspondence with Commissioner Verheugen for seven years now on this issue. Why? Because I have in my constituency a company called Eco Solutions, which has developed a perfectly safe alternative to dichloromethanes. It is a water-based alternative. It has the same effect even if the process takes a little longer. I am sorry to say that the only Member State lobbying hard for the retention of dichloromethane use was the United Kingdom, which also produces in industrial quantities many such substances. It took me four years’ work with Commissioner Verheugen to get the Commission’s expert committee even to look at the existence of this safer water-based alternative, and it has taken three years to get that water-based alternative recognised as an effective and useable technology. But I am pleased to say that, as with all the best stories, this one has a happy ending. Dichloromethanes will come off the market for non-industrial use. My constituents will become richer with their new technology, and everybody will live happily ever after thanks to the excellent work of Carl Schlyter and his colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Mr President, the qualities of this French Presidency have been almost fairytale: a bold prince riding out on the mythical white stallion of EU military deterrence to save our Lady of Georgia, the Cinderella from London finally admitted to the ball and a fair princess in Berlin learning, in response to a note from the Kanzleramt to the Élysée, that, if she wants to be with Prince Charming, she must be ready to kiss a frog. (Laughter)
 President-in-Office, I imagine you would not have chosen the challenges which confronted your presidency, but you have tackled them with energy, with enthusiasm and with creativity, and you have shown the power of European solidarity. We congratulate you on the success of last week’s Council. Your timetable for economic recovery will help restore confidence in the markets. Your parrying of protectionism is admirable. Your concessions on state aid and public procurement are reasonable, alongside your commitment to accompany them with the structural reforms laid down in the Lisbon Strategy. The summit’s conclusions allow scope to reduce VAT. Liberal Democrats urge Ecofin to cut VAT now on energy-saving and renewable energy equipment, in order to help industry and the environment. We also welcome the renewed commitment to sustainable public finances and a rapid return to medium-term budgetary targets. Our response to the recession must be based on solidarity and sound economics. You appear to have found a practical answer to Ireland’s worries about the new Treaty. It may not be elegant, but it is worthy of Henry IV of France: Si Paris valait une messe, Dublin vaut un commissaire
. On security and defence policy, real progress has been made: the creation of a single planning structure for ESDP missions, a structured form of cooperation with NATO and a declaration of our aims and objectives in the struggle for security. It is, however, on climate change that you may be more harshly judged. A blizzard of corporate concessions has been written into the Council conclusions; new Member States will be bought off with a solidarity slush fund; cap-and-trade emissions permits will be given away when they should have been auctioned, and major players like electricity companies will get derogations that amount to super-subsidies. All of this pushes down the cost of carbon, cuts the cash raised and makes the emissions targets harder to hit. What is more, the emissions trading system will not even come into effect until 2013. Nonetheless, my group recognises your achievement in reaching that deal. We welcome the agreements on energy saving, on earmarking half the revenues from emissions to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and on carbon capture and storage. We will support it in tomorrow’s vote. One can always wish for more from any presidency. On CAP reform, we have seen movement. We wanted to see opening-up. On immigration, the Blue Card comes wrapped in red tape and, on trade, the cancellation of this week’s Doha talks leaves little hope for progress. But this presidency has been a success for Europe, and you, President-in-Office, deserve the credit. After these six months you probably also deserve a break. You do not need to do everything. Leave the finance ministers to Jean-Claude Juncker. Leave the euro to Jean-Claude Trichet. End a fairytale presidency with a fairytale ending. Follow the advice of your favourite singer: C’est le temps du départ, retournez à d’autres étoiles et laissez-nous la fin de l’histoire.

 Mr President, you cannot just take note of these points of order. It is the clear will of the people in this Chamber to have Mr Borloo here and to hear what he has to say before the debate, so let us wait. (Applause)

(FR)
 Mr Borloo, we were told that you had come from Paris by plane. If this is the case, next time, take the train. This would ensure that you arrive here on time and would preserve your green reputation.  Mr President, the Union might be days away from an historic breakthrough in combating climate change. Our national leaders like to talk in shades of green, but now we are going to see the colour of their money. In March of last year they agreed to a 20% cut in carbon emissions by 2020 and now we hear the shuffling of cold feet in the Council. Our job is to turn up the heat. As you have said, Mr President, climate change is the greatest challenge facing us. Although there are some who yelp that they cannot afford to cut carbon emissions as they agreed, it is irresponsible of Italy to claim that it would push up power bills by 17.5%. Renewable energy generation will bring down bills, and will save us not only money but lives. There are signs of progress on the deal. We are about to embark on a real market-led cap and trade system, one that would be sensitive to the needs of Member States while still achieving its goals, but we need the Council to reaffirm the commitment to 20% renewable energy by 2020; we need the Council to map out the route to accountable and transparent effort-sharing in those areas not covered by the emissions trading scheme; and we need the Council to commit to the research that will unleash the potential of green technologies like carbon capture and storage. We must act to make sure that a combination of industrial lobbying and national self-interest, which has cost us progress on car emissions, does not blight next week's historic opportunity. Europe has a chance to lead the world in the quest to cut carbon emissions, to bring about real change to the benefit of future generations. When has so noble a quest been right there within our grasp? The Council must keep its word.

 Mr President, last time we met we praised the Council’s speedy response to the financial crisis. But for this European Council, speed seems no longer to be of the essence. Well, it should be. The challenges facing our Union are real. The recession is smothering businesses and climate change grows ever more stark. We need the Council and the Commission to acknowledge what Martin Luther King called ‘the fierce urgency of now’. Yesterday, our finance ministers failed to grasp the urgency of the recovery plan. The stimulus impulse is changing from sugar to treacle. The Presidency should tell us which Member States were against. We have got to stay within the Stability and Growth Pact, maintain competition and state aid rules and meet the challenge of the Lisbon Agenda, but we have got to act fast. The Council will, of course, search for a legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions. There has been progress: cap and trade, not regulation and burden, derogations for small-scale emitters, sensitivity to individual states’ circumstances and a sliding scale for carbon auctioning – all these are reasonable. What would not be reasonable is any attempt by any Member State to shoot down a long-term plan for short-term self interest. If we do not tackle climate change now, the bill will balloon. Last week’s deal on CO2
 from cars shows how easy it is to take the path of least resistance, to let vested interests get ahead of global interests. There will be costs in a climate-change deal, but there are opportunities too. Europe can lead the world in green innovation. The prizes go to the bold and Europe must have the courage of its convictions. Last week, the Irish published a thoughtful report on options for the Treaty of Lisbon. Now the Taoiseach must come forward with a concrete plan and a clear time frame for moving forward, because Europe’s citizens want an effective European Union. You will never convince anyone to have more confidence in our Union if it does not work. And we saw last week an example of the Union not working. Members of this House who escaped last week’s bombings in Mumbai were met by an EU consul who told them he would help only citizens from his own country. Nothing shows more the urgent need for coordinated EU consular protection. Our Union must protect all its citizens in their time of need. The Commission President has said ‘we sink or swim together’. Well, some may prefer to tread water, but Europe has done that before and it does not work. We need action now from the European Council.

This report makes recommendations to the European Commission on applying the principle of equal pay for men and women, and that principle is the key to ensuring dignity, fairness and equality in pension entitlements. For years now I have strongly backed the Plymouth Senior Citizens' Petition calling for the just treatment of older women. I was proud to submit three amendments to the Bauer report, reflecting the Plymouth campaigners' demands, and I am delighted that all three have been accepted. The European Parliament has recognised that many women lose out on earnings as a result of their work caring for children and older people. It has called on the Commission to eliminate the risk of poverty among pensioners and secure for them a decent standard of living. And it has set as a goal the equality of male and female pensions, including the retirement age. Now we need the European Union and national governments to take heed of these words and turn fine sentiments into forward steps. Pension equality for senior citizens is a worthy goal, and I am proud to support this report.

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate the President of the Commission: this was the first time the Commission has been represented at such a summit and it is, indeed, very welcome. I would also like to congratulate the President-in-Office, not only on the excellent work that he has done for the French presidency, but also on his reward, at the presidency of the Autorité des marchés financiers
. If 1989 was a decisive victory for the free market economy, then 2008 must be the year in which we remind ourselves of Adam Smith’s warning that unbridled free markets have their limits. Adam Smith, in the Wealth of Nations
, foresaw many things, and there are many lessons there for us in what he said. My group welcomes the success of the G20 meeting. We welcome its commitment to a shared belief that market principles, open trade and investment regimes and effectively regulated financial markets foster the dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship that is essential for economic growth, employment and the fight against poverty. After 1929, countries made the mistake of seeking individual salvation. This time we have recognised that salvation must come collectively. Many of the measures proposed in the Commission’s work programme for 2009 will help us on that road. I congratulate the Commission on that work programme, especially on the plan to ensure regulation and oversight and transparency of financial actors and significant capital market investors. Free markets thrive on transparency and honesty. In the current difficulties, some are still seeking scapegoats. They are arguing that warning bells were not sounded. But they were! Otto Graf Lambsdorff and Jacques Delors and others wrote a letter to the Slovenian presidency very early this year warning of the dangers of the overheating of the world economy. Jean-Claude Juncker reminded us last night, in his excellent speech in our debate on the 10th anniversary of the euro, that the Eurogroup made a number of representations to the Americans and others about the dangers that we were facing. Liberal Democrats are not going to waste time looking for the guy who failed to spot the iceberg: we will concentrate on getting people into lifeboats. We are concerned by one aspect, however, of the European Union and the G20’s response. Our Heads of State and Government appear to believe that we can go back to business as before, that all that is needed is economic growth. I fear they simply have not understood so many of the lessons of the last 30 years in politics. The recession should be a good time to take stock. Even with the recession, world GDP is forecast to double in the next 20 years, and yet that growth is based on finite resources, on failing to factor in the cost of waste, and on another coal-fired power station in China every week. The Presidency Note of 28 October to inform the EU’s preparatory summit on 7 November had four innovation points. One of them was about sustainability. It said that internationally coordinated macroeconomic responses, based on promotion of environmental investments, including in developing countries, are important. Well, clearly, some minister or official in the French presidency has been doing some joined-up thinking. But that did not get into the agreed language which passed for the conclusions of the preparatory summit, which talked only about climate change in one sentence in a list of other challenges. Nor did it get into the G20 conclusions, other than as the penultimate point in the penultimate point, which talked about examples of other critical challenges, mentioning climate change as No 2. There is no contradiction between Keynes and fighting climate change. A modern-day Maynard Keynes would put people back to work installing solar panels and wind generators on every house in Europe, fostering innovation and providing jobs simultaneously. A modern-day Roosevelt, seeing that we have a global economy of which the contours are drawn in the computer campuses of West Coast America, the factories of China and the coal centres of India, would have us seek a global culture, global governance and a coherent vision of global concern. That is the way forward. It will never again be business as before.

 Mr President, I address my remarks to the President-in-Office of the Council. President-in-Office, you brought us warm and encouraging words from last week’s Council. You said that Council and Parliament must work hand in hand – ‘travailler main dans la main
’ – but our job is to read the small print. Why do the Council conclusions refer only to cooperation between Council and Commission? (Applause)
 Why in all the paragraphs on climate change is there no mention whatsoever of the European Parliament? In paragraph 16 of this document, you should have invited the European Parliament – not just the Commission – to work with you; and recognise that Council and Parliament will decide, not the Council alone. Moreover, President-in-Office, you will find you need the European Parliament because some Member States are trying to unpick properly reached agreements. Europe must stick to its negotiated targets. It is dishonest of some governments to say that the new economic climate makes those agreements unachievable. New emissions targets for the car industry will not be in force until 2012: the emission-sharing proposals apply only after 2013, long after the global economy is forecast to pick up. Postponing action now will invite climate catastrophe and an even bigger bill. We need more than the Council agreed last week. President-in-Office, you rightly recognise the power of the markets. Since the Berlin Wall fell, 50 million Europeans have been lifted out of poverty because the free movement of goods, services and people is the key to Europe’s prosperity. More than that, it is vital to our liberty. Today we are seeing what happens when markets lack accountability. In recent weeks the global finance system has stared into an abyss and we need concerted action to pull it back. So my group welcomes the Council’s consolidation of the measures agreed by the euro area. They have alleviated the pressure on the interbank markets. Now we need to steer interest rates downwards to alleviate recession. We also welcome the Commission’s Capital Requirements Directive, the new accounting standards and the plans to control credit rating agencies. Europe must also play a leading role in negotiating a global system of financial governance. While rules are necessary, so are the means to enforce them. The Summit failed to agree an effective regime to supervise the financial system in Europe. I have made the case for a European financial services authority and it is rumoured that the President-in-Office also favours rigorous supervision at European level. By all means, try with the Americans to get a global agreement but proceed without them if they will not play ball. Supervision of the financial services industry remains the missing piece of the jigsaw. President-in-Office, you are a man of action. Your actions underline the case for a full-time President of the Council. You draw attention to our successes. In August, Europe kept the tanks out of Tbilisi. This month Europe has kept the banks in business. If, in December, Europe acts to preserve the planet then we should convince even the most sceptical that we need the Lisbon Treaty. (Applause)
 Graham Watson,

 Mr President, I would say to the President-in-Office: At next week’s European Council you must move forward discussions on the Lisbon Treaty. You must be constructive, yet be considerate to the countries which have yet to ratify. You must adopt the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum – though we must still search for schemes to seek skilled newcomers and manage migration – and you should discuss progress in combating climate change. But no one can mistake the most pressing issue facing this Council. A storm is battering global finance markets, and its effects are being felt across Europe – in jobs lost, pensions eroded and savings under threat. Our citizens are worried. The challenges we face may be the gravest for generations, and they are evolving at lightning speed. It is at moments like this that our Union is defined. We need a collective response. We cannot sustain a situation in which Member States surprise one another through unilateral decisions with multilateral implications. Europe needs coordinated and consistent policies to stem the flow of financial losses, to establish transparency and good practice and to prevent future woes. There are some who think they can now tap-dance on the grave of capitalism; but solutions will not be found in closed markets and command economies. They only ever short-changed Europe’s citizens. If you build your house there, Martin Schulz, it will be a house built of straw. What we are witnessing is not the failure of the market economy. Rather it is the excesses of unfettered, ineffectively regulated markets. Financial markets currently owe less to Adam Smith than to the Cincinnati Kid. The greed of individual bankers, traders and short-sellers is certainly to blame, but so too is the failure of governments to ensure transparency and honesty in their dealings. Liberal Democrats have long warned of the dangers which caught the Council unaware and the Commission wrong-footed. Last May my friend Otto Graf Lambsdorff, together with Jacques Delors and others, signed a letter to the Slovenian presidency of the Council. It highlighted the profound danger of economic collapse posed by recent banking practices. In that letter they wrote, ‘Decent capitalism needs effective public policy. Profit-seeking is the essence of a market economy, but when everything is for sale, social cohesion melts and the system breaks down.’ Europe was slow to heed such worries. It must now do what it can to put that system back to business. Liberals and Democrats hope that the conclusions of the Ecofin Council will form the basis for agreement at the European Council. They are not an overnight cure, but they will help to remedy the underlying sickness. It is right to raise deposit guarantee protection to a EUR 50 000 minimum across the Union. Family savings will be secure and capital flight discouraged. We also look forward to hearing the Commission’s proposal to promote convergence of deposit guarantee schemes, just as we support rapid adoption of your ideas for improving capital adequacy. When you look at credit rating agencies, look at who pays their fees and at how they are supervised. But we also need to strengthen the links between national financial regulators. Representatives from the euro-zone central banks sit together in the Governing Council of the ECB. Similarly, we need a pan-European financial services authority to maintain order and transparency between financial institutions. The European Council should ask whether the European Union budget might be used to allow the European Investment Bank and the EIF to give credit guarantees for small businesses. They, after all, provide the jobs on which Europeans rely. It is those people who now need speedy and specific action, who need all parties and all Member States to work as one, who expect common solutions to a common challenge.

 Mr President, this social package is a welcome step forward in the building of a European community which cares for its citizens. The people who cast votes against the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty sent a clear message. The message is they will not give the European Union new powers simply because we want them. Our people want to know what kind of European Union we are building. This package is extensive and controversial, and we must make sure that people know the benefits that it will bring to their lives. There is much to praise, as Commissioner Špidla says, in the European Works Council Directive and, of course, in the proposal on patients’ rights in cross-border health care, for which my group has fought so hard. But I want today to concentrate on two specific measures in this package. First, the revision of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which helps people who have lost their jobs to find new ones. At present, a thousand posts must be under threat before a company can apply. Liberals and Democrats welcome the proposal to lower that threshold and to simplify claims procedures, not because the European Union should plan work for Europe – that role is best filled by the internal market – nor in the belief that the EU should provide unemployment benefit – that is for Member States. Rather, we welcome this proposal because it is based on a sound liberal principle: that employment is the best source of welfare. With growth grinding to a halt and some Member States already in recession, this policy will help prevent a spiral of sudden job losses that create welfare dependency. Second, the Anti-Discrimination Directive: my group has fought for this from the beginning of this Commission’s term of office. The definition of discrimination will now cover the main spectrum of minorities – older people, gay people, disabled people, people of all faiths and none – and it will apply to clients and consumers, as well as employees. This, too, is a liberal measure which will proffer practical benefits, the kinds that come from knowing you can do your job and live your life free from the tyranny of prejudice. The draft directive should go further than it does. There are still loopholes, still opportunities for discrimination to rear its head. Why, for example, Commissioner, is it right to outlaw discrimination in the workplace, but to allow Member States to use discriminatory schoolbooks in the classroom? Nonetheless, Europe is breaking down the barriers of discrimination, piece by piece. My group welcomes the commitment of the Commission and the Council to further that process, just as we insist on the full involvement of this House in framing the measures that complete it. In February Mr Barroso brought to us a major package of measures to fight climate change. Today, the Commission’s proposals on social policy demonstrate to its detractors that Europe cares for community cohesion and that liberal economic policies need be no threat to progressive policies for a healthy environment and a society served by solidarity. Mr Schulz bemoans the predominance of centre-right governments in the European Union, but we live in a democracy and people choose their governments. They are distinctly unconvinced by what the Socialists are offering.

 Mr President, I am a little surprised by the President-in-Office’s speech tonight, as indeed I am by its delivery from the podium d’honneur
. The conflict in the Caucasus is one for which both sides must take responsibility, as you have said, President-in-Office. So why do the Council’s conclusions not reflect this? President Saakashvili cannot have believed that military intervention would evoke no response from Russia. Equally, Russia’s reaction was disproportionate. You said, ‘Les dégâts n’ont pas été considérables
,’ and yet Commissioner Ferrero Waldner has given us the figures and this House will be called on to agree to pay the bill! On one thing we do agree with you: we must condemn Russia’s actions; they are indefensible, but we will not dissuade the Russian bear by backing Medvedev into a corner. Dialogue and engagement will defuse tensions better than isolation. That is the lesson of the Cold War, and the Union – as with the Helsinki Process – has a central role to play. This conflict highlights the need for us to build a common foreign and security policy. And though Member States hold diffuse views about Russia, your presidency was quick to negotiate its six-point plan and for that credit is due. The plan may not be perfect, but it has brought an end to violence and it should be fully implemented, including Russian withdrawal from the Black Sea port of Poti. But what steps should the Union take now? The Council is right to agree a crisis-management and reconstruction fund and the rapid deployment of humanitarian assistance. Now it must designate an EU representative who will make both sides listen. The Union is right to send observers, but they must replace Russian peacekeepers, which will mean commitment from those Member States which are not already stretched militarily on other fronts. Europe should convene a trans-Caucasian peace conference, bringing together all sides in the search for the settlement of unresolved conflicts. But the Union should start in one area of glaring inconsistency which requires little more than ministerial fiat to fix. End the anomaly whereby Georgian citizens with Russian passports have freer access to the European Union, because this encourages them to adopt Russian citizenship. Georgians should have the same access to Europe as Russians, although this could be achieved by freezing the visa facilitation agreement with Russia. In strengthening our neighbourhood policy, how can we ensure continued cooperation with Russia while showing that a full ‘strategic partnership’ is no longer credible? What more can we do to cut Europe’s dependence on Russia’s energy supplies? You did well to strengthen the text of your conclusions in that regard. Russia must of course face the consequences of its illegal actions, perhaps including a discussion on the future of the Sochi Winter Olympics just 40 km from the border. Can Russia’s behaviour be considered in keeping with the Olympic Charter? No. Solving these matters requires determination, foresight and patience. That is a challenge that this Union must meet and I am afraid, President-in-Office, one that we must meet before we offer you your vin d’honneur
.

 Mr President, I would put it to the President-in-Office that the Irish vote against the Treaty has made his impressively prepared presidency more problematic. It has also made the case for a practical, problem-solving Europe stronger than ever. The energy and climate packages become more urgent every day. Capping VAT is a short-term sop: Europe should be cutting its dependence on oil and gas. We need much more investment in renewable energy: small-scale and localised to bring household bills down, and large-scale, such as using the Union for the Mediterranean to invest in high-voltage solar thermal power production in North Africa. On Tuesday the G8, which is the source of nearly two thirds of the world’s CO2
, approved an emissions-reduction target of 50%. But the emerging economies are right to say that the target should be higher – perhaps 80% – with interim targets. To stabilise food prices we need good ideas, such as the recent CAP reforms of Commissioner Fischer Boel, not protectionism, however disguised. The truth is that people care more about the petrol price and the bread bill than about the grand aims of our Union. Today nobody should say ‘Qu’ils mangent de la brioche’ 
(‘Let them eat cake’). The President-in-Office is right to put the focus on migration. But migration will be manageable only when we manage the despair that leads so many to risk so much to come here. There should be routes for legal migration, a crackdown on people-smuggling, and reform of our farm policy to kick-start growth in the countries of origin. It may be optimistic to ask a French presidency to liberalise markets. But to bring security within our borders we must bring hope beyond them. There is another way in which the French presidency can break new ground. France gave us the Rights of Man. Now France must lead in their defence. At home, by pressing ahead with the anti-discrimination directive. Abroad: by anchoring peace in the Balkans in a European Union future; by using the Union for the Mediterranean to improve human rights in North Africa; and by uniting in our dealings with Russia and condemning China’s crackdown on dissent.  (FR)
 President-in-Office, do not go to Beijing. Play a team game. (Applause)
 It was Voltaire who told us: ‘Mortals are equal; it is not birth, but virtue alone that makes the difference.’  And by taking a lead, Europe can demonstrate its virtue and demand that the dignity of every man and woman be recognised. President-in-Office, to succeed, you will need to build consensus. You will need Parliament, Council and Commission to work together to a common agenda set by 27 Member States and this House. If we are to argue, it must be about that agenda, not its messengers. You have plunged into a polemic with the President of the ECB and with two Commissioners, but they represent our Union and the policies we have agreed. It is not the European way to divide and rule. We must stand on our principles but work together to achieve our common goals.  (FR) 
Mr President, I know I am coming to the end, but please give me ‘soixante petites secondes pour ma dernière minute’ with Carla Bruni’s husband. (Laughter)
  President-in-Office, if you stand on your principles and let us work together to achieve common goals, if you do that, Liberals and Democrats will work with you. (Applause)
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
 – Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on the achievements of his country’s Presidency. Some may have had the impression that it was just the warm-up act for the next Presidency, but those who delve more deeply know that solid progress has been made and that Slovenia has indeed left its mark upon our Union. In justice and home affairs, the Slovenian Presidency has extended the freedom of the Schengen area to new Member States, struck a deal to improve the Schengen information system, achieved political agreement on Europol and, most importantly, seen through a directive which is the first building block in a common immigration policy. I hope we will learn the lesson that such building blocks need to be better explained, for it met with substantial public resistance, but my Group was nonetheless pleased to support it and sees it as a great step forward. In agriculture, the Presidency concluded a Health Check to modernise and simplify the CAP; it oversaw measures to reduce inflationary pressure on food prices and, in economic policy, created a fifth freedom – that of the movement of knowledge. It also established a mobile satellite services system, an instrument which is to be signed today. The Consumer Credit Directive, the goods package, the Customs Code, the Postal Directive and the directive on environmental protection under criminal law can all be added to the Council Presidency’s achievements. My Group is pleased to see some progress on the Western Balkans, with the signing of stabilisation and association agreements with Serbia as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we congratulate you on your role in the establishment of a new government in Belgrade. If the Council Presidency has not been successful in tackling growing public disillusion with the European Union, it is not unique in that. The anger at the endless motorcades and police cars on the streets of Ljubliana is symptomatic of a wider unease. We need to demonstrate that we are the servants of the people, and not their masters. We know that the Irish people are disillusioned not with their own government, but with the institutions of the European Union. As France Prešeren says in ‘The Master Theme’: ‘They were all fed on many a plaint and tear … As over them Malignant storm-clouds flew.’ It would do us no harm to re-read the Laeken Declaration, which summed up so poignantly the problem we face in overcoming the gap between the governed and the governors. If problems with the Lisbon Treaty overshadowed Slovenia’s Presidency, they were not of its own making. Indeed there is some poetic justice in the country which first caused the problem on 29 May 2005 now having to help find a solution, 37 months later. The ‘Sky Team’ of Sarkozy and Klaus will have to decide on progress up to the next European elections, and the formation of the next Commission. I hope that the Council meeting last weekend has proved helpful in recognising that we need to prioritise people issues, particularly in the field of civil law and in protecting people from oil and food price rises; and in upholding the right of the Presidency, irrespective of the size of the Member State, to invite whomsoever they want to supper! (Applause from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe)

 Madam President, as the Irish Prime Minister sets out for Brussels tomorrow, he might well chew over the words of the Irish pop group U2: ‘Where did it all go wrong?’ The other heads of state and government should also reflect why, on the threshold of a new French presidency, we have come full circle since the last: from Nice to Nice. There is clear evidence that a majority in every Member State supports the European Union. There is scant evidence that a majority in any favours further construction. We cannot say for sure that any treaty would get a majority in any country. Trust in institutions is ebbing away. So it is no good for blithe spirits in Berlin to whistle that other U2 hit ‘With or without you’, or for people in Paris to push Ireland into voting again. As Brecht pointed out, you cannot dissolve the people. Though fewer than a million voted against, and in a landscape littered with lies, the people are not persuaded. Why? First, because we’ve done little to convince them of the changes we champion. The Commission has a Plan ‘D’ for Dialogue, but our Member State governments have no equivalent. Certainly there is a role for Parliament and Commission in explaining the European Union – but also for every national government, every single day, not just when ratification of the latest treaty is due. And there is a job here, too, not just for political parties at European level, but for political parties in every Member State. Second, while the EU has created great wealth, it is now amassed less honestly and spread less fairly. Our political and our business leaders must come to grips with huge ethical issues. And Mr Schulz, I am sorry you have only five heads of state of government these days, but those issues are no less valid in the countries run by Socialists than they are in any other! (Applause)
 Third, for all the freedoms for goods and for capital – and even for services – our Union is not famed for freedoms for its people. Cross-border complications in civil law – custody of children in divorce cases, problems with properties abroad – fill the mailbags of MEPs. A lack of safeguards in cross-border criminal cases and a cavalier approach to data protection add to that unease. What the EU promises in theory, it too often fails to deliver in practice. This is the backdrop against which our response to Ireland must be measured. Here in this House, we want the new Treaty. We know it helps put right these wrongs. But beyond this forest of metal and glass, this is too little understood. So my group’s advice to Council is this. Get on with the real business of Europe: boosting trade, combating climate change, fighting food and fuel price rises. Let those who will continue to ratify the Treaty. If necessary, make do with Nice. Use the passerelle clause to speed up Europe’s problem-solving potential. Forget the full-time president until you settle what the six-month stagiaire
 is going to do. Launch a comprehensive campaign to remind people why the EU exists, inform them how it works and explain why, like the proverbial pint of Guinness, it is good for you. Europe means too much to too many to allow this crisis to stop it in its tracks. (Applause)

 Madam President, with his proposals for a Mediterranean Union, President Sarkozy recognised what many knew yet would not admit: that the Barcelona Process – top-down and driven by European interests – was dead in the water, leading our southern partners to opt out and a widening prosperity gap to emerge on either side of the Mediterranean. If Europe is serious about reversing the failures of the last decade and generating development and security on its southern shores we must now learn to give as well as take. We must build on the ashes of the Barcelona Process – a true partnership based on trust, reciprocity and, above all, mutual respect. The Mediterranean must not be a cultural dividing line but a meeting place. Joint investment in infrastructure – such as ports, sea links and energy grids – will bring our peoples together far more effectively than the high-sounding declarations which characterised the Barcelona Process. We need investment in people too. The kind of energy which brought together the French and Germans after the last big war must be invested in bringing Europeans and North Africans together to prevent the next. The worst possible mistake the French Presidency could make is to commit the European Union – and by extension its citizens – to a grandiose project without providing finance for such cooperation for a number of years down the line. And, as Mr Schulz said, creating a full-blown bureaucratic structure alongside the standing delegations and the External Action Service need not be the way; a focus on values must be. Despite the worsening situation, particularly in Egypt and Israel, and the fact that we claim such values as the basis of EU foreign policy, references to human rights are mysteriously hard to find in the Commission’s proposals. I hope this is something the Commission will look at. But, these objections aside, Liberals and Democrats are pleased to show support for this Union for the Mediterranean, with one important caveat: pragmatic cooperation on economic issues must not be a substitute for promoting peace in the Middle East through the common foreign and security policy envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty. Since the Commissioner recognises the link between economic development and peace, what would be a better sign of peace and goodwill towards our Arab neighbours than abolishing agricultural tariffs? Our much-vaunted free trade agreements have failed to boost living standards because they excluded agriculture and services, which account for two thirds of the GDP in the Middle East and North Africa. If we do not take the produce of these countries, we will end up taking their people. Reforming the CAP, providing a level playing field for goods from the Southern Mediterranean, would go a long way towards tackling the causes of record migration into Europe. As the inimitable Doctor Johnson once said ‘Life cannot subsist ... but by reciprocal concessions’. And, for the sake of the success of this Union, Europe must make the first move.

 Mr President, if the interim report from our Committee on Climate Change does no more than state the obvious, that is no bad thing. For it confirms, in black and white, what most of us have acknowledged for some time. The science of climate change is incontrovertible. Permafrost and ice caps are melting, sea-levels and temperatures rising, largely due to human activity. Failure to act now means humankind will hurtle towards a tipping point from which there is no return. The deadlines for climate policy are set not by the European Union, nor by the world community: they are set by nature. And the bottom line is that – despite commitments in Kyoto – global greenhouse gas emissions are growing faster than ever before, up by a quarter since 1990. Some scientists say CO2
 concentrations have already gone too far. All agree the window of opportunity open to us to stabilise emissions and limit the rise in temperature to two degrees above pre-industrial levels will close within seven years. Democracies are run by crisis management. Serious problems are often not tackled until they have to be tackled, and as Karl-Heinz Florenz points out in this excellent report we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions not by 20%, but possibly by up to 40%, depending on what deal can be made with third countries at the Copenhagen talks next year. There are positive signs from the other big polluters, China and the USA. Beijing showed a new-found willingness to negotiate at the UN summit in Bali and all three US presidential candidates are committed to tackling climate change. What we must do – in the absence of further evidence, and with the resources at hand – is to approve the Commission’s climate change package, and I salute the work that my colleagues Lena Ek, Chris Davis and Vittorio Prodi have done in this area. We must also redouble our efforts to promote clean energy – and the amazing thing is this: we know how. Generating power from the desert sun, as a supplement to sources of renewable energy here in Europe, could speed up the process of cutting CO2
 emissions at a stroke. Indeed, satellite-based studies by the German Aerospace Centre have shown us that, using less than 0.3% of the desert area of the Middle East and North Africa, enough high-voltage electricity can be generated to supply current and future demand in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. It is not rocket science. It has been done for 20 years in California. Plants are now being built in Spain and Morocco to do the same. If we could summon the drive and the determination, the guts and the grit, we could make the shift from oil while providing jobs, drinking water and better infrastructure for those bearing the brunt of climate change. We could combat climate change without having to turn off the lights. Our aim should be to put Europe’s money where its mouth is, to invest money in high-voltage solar thermal power generation and political capital in the human relations across the Mediterranean Sea to make it possible. We could find no better ammunition for use in negotiations with the UN to get a progressive international agreement in Copenhagen. (Applause)

 Mr President, I rise on the situation of the Roma minority and citizens from new Member States in Italy. In recent days there have been police raids on Roma communities in Rome. 118 of those detained have been ordered to be expelled immediately and the new mayor has said that he will expel 20 000 people. There have been arson attacks on Roma camps in the suburbs of Naples, with the mob preventing fire services getting in to extinguish the fires. Hundreds of immigrant families have fled for their lives and there are reports of a number of children missing. My colleague, Viktória Mohácsi, has been in Rome. She has sent worrying reports and I hope she will have an opportunity to respond to the Council’s statement tomorrow. We know attacks in many of our Member States on immigrant communities are a problem, but the level of violence in Italy is unusual. The OSCE has accused Italy of stigmatising migrants and it seems to me that the nature of the recent election campaign has led to a culture of impunity for those carrying out these attacks. Even Commissioner Frattini, who was the first to lecture the new Member States on the integration of ethnic minorities, is now questioning the Schengen Agreements. This issue is of Europe-wide concern. It goes to the heart of the reasons for founding the European Union and I would urge the Commission and the Council urgently to discuss the matter to see what can be done to help.

 Mr President, Mr Michel spoke for the Commission but in the place of the Council. He has considerable experience of both institutions, fortunately, which is to our benefit.  Mr President, the past year has seen startling hikes in the cost of basic foods, such that 100 million people are being pushed into poverty and hundreds of thousands put at risk of starvation. So grave is the threat that it will cancel out all progress towards the goal of halving world poverty by 2015. Europe’s rise in living standards has been rapid, so rapid that even my generation remembers, on our continent, gardens where little grew except the appetites of young children. We must not stand idly by in our privileged position as disaster unfolds. We must give more money to the World Food Programme now, so that it can feed the destitute, and my group welcomes the Commissioner’s commitments in this regard. Many lay the blame on biofuels. Indeed, the United Nations special rapporteur has called agrofuels a ‘crime against humanity’. Yet the reasons for the recent food price rises are many and varied, and so must be the international community’s response. World population growth, poor growing conditions linked to climate change, loss of agricultural land to industrial use, immoral commodities speculation and changing eating habits have all contributed to the current crisis. Meat consumption in China, for example, has risen from 20 kg per capita in 1980 to 50 kg per capita in 2007, and if every kilogram of beef requires 2 000 square feet of land and 13 000 litres of water, while the same nutritional content can be found from soya at 1% of the land and water use, we begin to see the complexity of the problem. Far and away the worst offender is market distortion, which traps poor farmers in a cycle of poverty and gives them little incentive to increase food production. The high standards of sustainability for sourcing and manufacture, written into the European Union’s biofuels proposals, effectively insure Europe against non-sustainable use. So, rather than using biofuels as a scapegoat, we must move to end agricultural protectionism and export restrictions; we must move to enhance agricultural development in the poorest countries and to ensure the success of the Doha Development Round to encourage free, fair and sustainable farm trade at global level. It is the common agricultural policy, not European biofuels, that are the root cause of this problem, and it is CAP reform, not dropping biofuels targets, that will solve it. We must also use our collective weight to ensure that climate change and sustainability criteria are integrated with trade policy. The truth is we can afford to feed the world and, as Dominique Strauss-Kahn has said, ‘global cooperation can deliver the macroeconomic framework and the incentives needed to address the problem’. My group believes that with the right political will and the right international cooperation, globalisation can be the solution, not the problem. It is up to the European Union to lead the way.

 Mr President, your speech at our recent part-session in Brussels on the events in Tibet was extremely well received by the House, and I think it enjoyed the support of all the Members present. It quite clearly reflected the public opinion in the European Union about the recent repression in Tibet. Considerable concern was also expressed by the Commission and by a number of Member States in Council. It is surprising, therefore – and to my group disappointing – that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has decided not to invite the Dalai Lama to come to Brussels to meet ministers. It therefore seems to me all the more important that this House pursue your suggestion that the Dalai Lama should come, and I wonder whether I might ask you to get in touch with the Dalai Lama’s office to see whether he could advance the visit from the current schedule foreseen for December to an earlier date, since clearly the interest in this House and in Europe in discussing the events in Tibet before December is very great. (Applause)

 Mr President, the oral question that underlies this debate smacks to me of atavistic resentment of a constitutional nature. This House is at its worst if we allow such sentiment to stain our approach to the politics of the European Union. I would ask the Commissioner to clarify three points for us, and I hope he will come back at the end of the debate and do that. First, that the collision and sinking of the New Flame
 happened not in the Bay of Gibraltar, which the Spanish call the Bay of Algeciras, but on the south-east side of the Rock of Gibraltar, off Europa Point in the Mediterranean Sea. Second, that the New Flame
 incident had nothing to do with the bunkering of oil, as the ship was carrying scrap metal. Third, that there have not been seven oil spills, as claimed in the oral question, but one minor spill during a storm on 9-10 February. Seven hundred and eighty cubic metres of fuel were pumped off the vessel in the month following the incident, none of which was spilt. I would be grateful if the Commissioner would confirm that to the House. If there is oil on the coast, it is more likely to have come from the Sierra Nava
, which broke anchor in a storm earlier in the year, ran aground and leaked oil. Perhaps the Commissioner would also comment on the cooperation between the Gibraltar authorities and the Spanish authorities. I believe that cooperation was exemplary. Gibraltar is in compliance with all its relevant international obligations, and I would invite my Spanish colleagues, particularly from the Partido Popular, to come with me to that part of my constituency, talk to the authorities and take a look at the wreck. There are indeed legitimate concerns over maritime safety and the danger of pollution, not just at sea, but also of the air and of groundwater, in the busy, heavily-populated industrial area in which Gibraltar and its Spanish hinterland are found. However, let us not allow the party-political devices of a disappointed opposition to colour our European considerations.
 Graham Watson  (ALDE
). - 
 Mr President, the Commissioner was absolutely right. This is in the territorial waters of Gibraltar, and it should go on the record that neither the incident nor the sinking of the New Flame
 was in the Bay of Gibraltar or Algeciras, however you call it. It was off the south-eastern tip of the rock in the Mediterranean Sea, and that should be clear on the record here.

 Mr President, this week’s Council takes place somewhere along the road between despair and hope. Although the major difficulties seem to be overcome, the Lisbon Treaty is not yet ratified, and questions linger over some of its provisions. Uncertainties abound about the political direction of Russia, Turkey and some of our neighbours in the Middle and Near East. Economic growth is slowing, haunted by the impact on GDP of past banking-sector crises in Sweden or Finland or Hungary or Spain, to say nothing of Argentina or Japan. It makes concerted action by our central banks this morning all the more welcome. Beyond these considerations, the major global challenges of population growth and migration, of international crime and terrorism, of climate change and energy security continue to weigh on the minds of our policy makers. The urgent implementation of the Commission’s proposals to tackle climate change is incumbent on the Member States and on this House. The contours of the challenge are wide. The report from the High Representative on the impact of climate change on security and stability shows us that there is a real and immediate concern, with the danger of military implications, including the use – sometimes discussed – of NATO as an instrument of energy security. Yet, blinded by short-term economic thinking, some of our Member States are already busy trying to limit their commitments to the Commission’s proposals on climate change. Look at the draft Council conclusions – paragraph 18 – and see some of the weasel words that have been inserted. These twin dangers carry the threat of a retreat into a Fortress Europe. It is only by increasing internal solidarity that we can avoid the trap that Member States fall into, such as choosing South Stream over Nabucco. It is only by extending solidarity beyond our shores that we can enjoy peace around the Mediterranean, that Mare Nostrum
, or around the Caspian Sea. Einstein was right when he said that peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by understanding. We also need to lead by example. I hope that in the Council conclusions we will see a commitment by national governments and the European Union to cut energy use in our own government and institutional buildings and in our car fleets, with binding targets to achieve that. There have been stern warnings from the IPCC and others of the cost of inaction. We must act and we can because, despite the strong headwinds, the economic fundamentals of the euro area economy are strong, as the President of the Commission says, with domestic demand and exports continuing to grow – a sign that the Lisbon Strategy is working and must be pursued. We hear what people are saying in this House. Mr Wurtz’s group was leading a protest about the threat to 12 000 jobs at Unilever. Mr Schulz wrote a letter to 27 Heads of State and Government calling for a change in economic direction, binding social standards and greater social protection. Yet these actions ignore the reality of what is happening in the global economy where, as more and more countries have opened their economies, the global ratio of trade to GDP has grown faster than total output. Half of our income now comes from trade and even developing countries now account for a third of world trade. The integration of the world economy is proving that it is not a zero-sum game. While Europe’s share of that economy may be shrinking, the overall growth means that we continue to create jobs and wealth. That is why we have created 6.5 million new jobs in the last two years. My group has long argued this and we are pleased that it has been recognised by Mr Jacques Delors and Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in the manifesto that they drafted for the PSE Group, which was adopted in Oporto some 15 months ago. Mr Schulz, if there is an ostrich in this room, it is not to be found in seat 21 [Mr Barroso’s seat]; it is to be found in seat 6 [Mr Schulz’s seat]. I think that explains why the PSE Group has lost its former role as the motor of this institution. The European Council must show more urgency in achieving its research and development targets. It must boost the market for venture capital and the mobility of researchers to foster innovation. It must improve transparency and supervision in the banking sector to ward off danger. Mr Lenarčič, you must pay attention to social cohesion and environmental stability but you must do so secure in the knowledge that markets are the most powerful tool we have to improve living standards. (Applause)
 Graham Watson  (ALDE
). – 
 Mr President, I will be very brief, but since Mr Schulz mentioned my name, let me at least say the following: Mr Schulz, I had no wish in what I was saying in any way to attack you personally, but I think we have a serious debate here about how to create competitive economies and how to stimulate competitive economies consistent with social cohesion and environmental stability. I do not believe that the way to create those economies is to argue that the market does not work because it does not produce the goods we want. I believe, as the President of the Commission was saying this morning, that the most recent evidence from the global economy is that the market can produce those goods and I think that is something around which we can unite and indeed prosper.
 Graham Watson  (ALDE
). – 
 Mr President, I do not see the logic in taking one of them before any of the others, because they are all different; they are all cases which have great merits on their own. My group, together with the GUE/NGL Group, has proposed that we have a debate on the Iranian homosexual in mortal danger, and I would like to find a way of dealing with this. I fear that this is what happens when groups do not coordinate and start acting out of order. We made a clear decision on Russia at the Conference of Presidents last week. If the cooperation – and there is a lot of it between the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group – cannot manage this in such a way that we do not end up in this mess, then I think the two groups ought to be looking at it. I think you have got to find a fair way, Mr President, of dealing with these three together.

 Mr President, the situation in Gaza is, first and foremost, a humanitarian disaster. No amount of condemnation of any party to the conflict will solve that. Gaza has been besieged since June of last year. One and a half million people are trapped with hopelessly insufficient provision of water, electricity, fuel and sewage disposal. Two years ago, three out of every five Gazans depended on UN assistance; it is now four out of every five. Businesses are bankrupt, jobs are almost impossible to find and the situation is worse than at any point since the Israeli annexation of the territory in 1967. The Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, has been held prisoner since June 2006, and I believe some 11 000 Palestinians languish in Israeli jails. The major condemnation of the European Union in all of this is that we have followed blindly the strategy of the Americans. Marc Otte, the European Union’s Special Representative, speaking to our Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council recently, said that, on strategy, the European Union follows the USA. The most obvious result of this is that Palestinian infrastructure, funded by the European taxpayer, is being regularly destroyed by the Israeli army using American weapons. Should we be committing European money in this way, in these circumstances? If ever there was a need for a common foreign and security policy for the European Union, surely this is it! My group welcomes the informal truce reached at lunchtime today. We wish Egypt success in its mediation talks, but we are convinced that the cycle of violence, which most recently led to 56 deaths in Gaza on 1 March 2008 and eight deaths in Jerusalem on Saturday, cannot be broken by violence. For peace to succeed, we need dialogue. Annapolis promised peace within 10 months, but many of us believe that, once again, Israel is trying to de-legitimise every interlocutor. Hamas continues to be cynical with its policy of rocket attacks, knowing that the response will be disproportionate. We condemn violence from all sides. Yes, Israel has a right to defend itself against indiscriminate attacks on civilians, but it has a duty as a democracy to be more just than its disposable power implies. We seem to be getting further away from a two-state solution – whether it is the rocket attacks on Ashkelon or whether it is the 530 new settler homes just announced in Givat Ze’ev, near Ramallah. The policy of the West has been based on three assumptions: number one, you cannot possibly talk to Hamas; number two, Israel is the only democracy in the region and must be treated as a normal democracy and, number three, Mr Abbas is the voice of the reasonable Palestinians. Many in my group question those three assumptions and believe that our policy needs to be looked at again urgently to find a situation where those communities can live together.

 Mr President, when Parliament first convened this series of debates on the future of Europe, few could foresee a Treaty in force by 2009. Europe was sinking, and to paraphrase Mr Reinfeldt’s countryman, August Strindberg, ‘there was something unnatural in it, for nature demands progress, evolution, and every backward step means wasted energy.’ Well, since then, the European Union has found the collective energy to set Europe back on the path to progress. By the time the Prime Minister’s country takes over the reins in 2009, the EU will have undergone a democratic revolution: it will be more open, more accountable, more responsive to its citizens. So those who attack the EU for being undemocratic are barking mad to oppose a treaty which puts citizens and their representatives in the driving seat. They are also barking up the wrong tree when they bring their protest to this Parliament, which has no responsibility for decisions by national governments on whether to hold a referendum. The Prime Minister, with his record as a consensus-builder in his own country, looks an ideal candidate to launch the European Union under a new Council, a new Parliament and a new Commission. But will he, in fact, be taking over the reins – as have presidencies in the past – or will he be simply a chef de cabinet
 to the full-time President of the Council? The truth is that the Treaty provides a framework for a future we have yet to sketch, a future where the biggest single challenge for our Union, as Sweden’s Europe Minister says, is delivering the practical results which citizens rightly demand and not the interminable naval gazing, which a Conseil des sages
 will simply prolong. Survey after survey shows that the Euro-sceptics are wrong. Citizens do not want less Europe. They want more: more joint action on terrorism, more joint action on energy and the environment, on defence and foreign affairs, on migration, on research and development. They want Europe to think big. And, yet, in almost all these areas, cooperation is in its infancy, because Member State governments in national capitals persist in gainsaying the public will. We have 10 months left before the Treaty enters into force. It is time for us to get our House in order, for this House to prepare for the greatest increase in powers it has ever seen and for the Council and the Commission to ‘Lisbonise’ both legislative proposals in the pipeline and current practices which must change. Urgent challenges lie ahead, as the Prime Minister alluded to. They will not be met without loyal cooperation between the institutions of government. My plea to the Prime Minister is to make sure that, by the time we have codecision in almost 80 policy areas and a huge increase in the workload of this House and in the Council, we have greater dialogue between Parliament and the Council to allow us to manage the Union properly: when it comes to dealing with the biggest foreign policy challenge for the Union now – the issue of Kosovo; when it comes to dealing with the question of Turkey, on which I agree so much with what the Prime Minister said; when it comes to dealing with big challenges, like world population growth, poverty and migration, of which he spoke. The Prime Minister outlined the challenges of globalisation, both at our immediate borders and beyond, challenges to which EU cooperation has the answers. Previous prime ministers have done the same in this Chamber, though without achieving such cooperation, so I commend to you a Swedish saying: Gott lära av andras fel, eftersom man inte hinner begå alla själv 
– it is well to learn from the errors of others, since there is no time to make them yourself. (Applause)

 Madam President, Liberals and Democrats welcome this package. We believe it to be the most important act of Mr Barroso’s Commission thus far. Climate change is the greatest challenge facing life on our planet, the biggest problem facing our governments, and a gnawing worry for our citizens. I am grateful to Mr Davies and Ms Ek for the work they have done within my group to make sure we have a firm and early response. It is important for the Commission to take action. National democracies are too often run by crisis management. Problems are not tackled until they have to be tackled, and sometimes action comes too late. California’s scientists warned us 30 years ago about climate change. We can no longer prevent it, but we can hope and strive to control it. Your proposals, President Barroso, recognise the overwhelming urgency of action. They will be hotly contested. Some will argue that they will hit profits; others will argue that they will hit jobs, and we have heard hints of both. No doubt you have had heated discussions in the Commission. My group argues they can add to profits and to jobs and give our economy a new competitive edge. They are, in any case, essential to responsible stewardship of our planet and we will work with you to secure agreement on them as early as possible.

 Mr President, I should like to address some remarks to Prime Minister Janša. President-in-Office, my group comes to you with one simple message: ‘Europe expects’. It expects 2008 to be a year of progress. We expect that progress to start now. And we expect your Presidency to rise to the challenge. I have no doubts you will. Was it not a feisty Slovene who, raising his fist against a mighty empire, first declared: ‘All roads do not lead to Rome!’? Well, neither do they lead to Paris, and this is not the start of the French Presidency. It is an historic first for the countries which entered our Union in 2004. President-in-Office, your country may be small in size but we know that it is mighty in spirit, and we know too that Europe’s Davids often make better presidencies than its Goliaths. True to form, your Presidency’s programme combines quiet ambition and a consensual style, which have the potential to unite our continent. Such unity will be vital to the early ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and to mustering support for an interinstitutional agreement on how to govern Europe under that new Treaty. On interinstitutional cooperation, we would welcome much dialogue with you and a greater presence of your Government in this Chamber. We regret that your seat was empty yesterday when we heard from the first guest in our Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Your programme speaks of the importance of internal dynamism – and that, Mr Schulz, is the way to create jobs and to maintain jobs in this continent: internal dynamism. We rely on you, President-in-Office, to push forward the single market in energy, in telecoms, in health-care services. The European Union has a hard enough time convincing its citizens that it adds value to their daily lives, so, in a clear-cut case for faster medical care, for lower bills, for greater consumer choice, we would be mad to push proposals for patients’ rights off the table just because they are controversial. In other areas, you will have to flex your muscles a great deal more – particularly with your presidential counterparts who have a vested interest in promoting nuclear energy as the panacea of climate change. Solidarity and burden-sharing are the key to success in cutting emissions and meeting renewable energy targets. In 2008, our Union must show, as President Barroso said, that it can turn fine words about combating climate change into action. Progress in the Western Balkans is rightly one of your priorities and your experience and understanding of the area will be a bonus to our Union. Nonetheless, I suspect that maintaining, as you do, that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is worse than that in Kosovo does not reflect majority opinion in the Union. Nor am I sure it is a good way to motivate the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If it is designed to appease Serbia, it will not work. Sweetening the pill of Kosovo’s independence with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement may be a way forward. But, while Mr Đelić readies his pen to come to Brussels, my group reiterates – in the strongest possible terms – that there can be no Stabilisation and Association Agreement without Serbia’s full cooperation with the ICTY. (Applause)
 Serge Brammertz, the new Chief Prosecutor, has yet to see fresh evidence of cooperation. None of us, President-in-Office, wish to see Serbia remain on Europe’s sidelines, and your Presidency’s courteous and constructive attitude may well bring it in from the cold and deliver Ratko Mladić. But in the mean time, as you say in Slovenia, ‘pray for a good harvest, but keep on hoeing’. (Applause)
 Graham Watson  (ALDE

 Mr President, we have over the holiday break seen a number of very worrying developments in Pakistan, not least, of course, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. We have the opportunity to discuss this matter this week. It is the view of my group that we should close our debate with a resolution, in particular since we should take a position sending a message to the Pakistani authorities in advance of the visit of Mr Musharaff to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House.
 Graham Watson  (ALDE
). – 
 Mr President, I rise on a matter which refers particularly to one Member State but, I believe, has wider European implications. This year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. One institution which does much to promote intercultural dialogue is the British Council. It is therefore of particular concern that Russia seeks to close the offices of the British Council in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. The work of the British Council in Russia is perfectly legal. It is regulated by a 1994 cultural agreement between London and Moscow. I therefore request that the matter be raised by colleagues with Russia in the context of our interparliamentary dialogue and that you, Mr President, use any opportunity which presents itself to express concern to the Russian authorities that a cultural matter, regulated by a perfectly normal agreement between two countries, is being trodden upon in an attempt by the Russian authorities to stifle political debate.
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group
. – 
Mr President, it is often said that the exception proves the rule and this Presidency proved no exception! Too often we are proffered fine words and vaulting ambitions from Presidency programmes honoured more in the breach than the observance. But, by resurrecting a Treaty that we all thought dead and buried, you have showed the improbable is indeed possible. From here on in, Lisbon will be etched on our memories as the moment Europe gave itself the tools and tenacity to make globalisation work for us, not against us. Politics would not be politics if we let major successes obscure minor failures. While the Lisbon Treaty is an undisputed success, one should beware of hubris. The Lisbon Summit, while symbolically important, may have pushed Europe and Africa further apart. Consensus on EPAs is receding as swiftly as EU assurances to put trade at the service of development. What happened to the great debate on flexicurity? Your big idea for revitalising Europe’s economy, which fizzled out before we failed even to define it? Where is the blue card for migration? Or greater labour mobility within the Union? Or linking the Lisbon and Gothenburg Agendas through full unbundling and cuts in CO2? You say you have left your mark on justice and home affairs, but watch out. Data-sharing arrangements are dangerously ahead of arrangements for data protection and data security. On the positive side of the ledger: European leadership in Bali, an excellent agreement on next year’s EU budget, the constructive abstentions you engineered to give us a common policy on Kosovo are tribute to the skills of your ministers. And, thanks to your courage and determination, Prime Minister, Europe’s bigger Member States can only retard rapid progress for so long. For, come 2009, when qualified majority voting is in place, when Parliament holds power of codecision and vetoes can no longer hold Europe hostage, the progressive majority, the centrist majority will succeed in making Europe’s choices black and white, unblemished by any blotch of brown. Europe may have lost Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’, but you have understood well what Shakespeare called the ‘the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world’. And, as befits the leader of a great seafaring nation, you have caught it on the ebb. (Applauses)
 Graham Watson  (ALDE

 Madam President, on a point of order, I wish to make a formal request to safeguard the dignity of our House. The behaviour of certain Members of this House in shouting down representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council during the signing ceremony was intolerable and must not be tolerated. It brings the worst of the football stadium into Europe’s highest Chamber and recalls the actions of the Communists in the Russian Diet and the National Socialists in the German Reichstag. (Applause)
 My formal request, Madam President, is this: my group demands that in future the Presidency use the powers granted to it under our Rules of Procedure to evict from the Chamber Members behaving in that fashion. (Loud applause)

 Madam President, I much admire the contribution of China to the development of world civilisation. In terms of technology, in terms of society and in terms of culture, China has probably contributed more than any other country to the development of humankind. I regret that China’s growing economic maturity is not accompanied by a growing political maturity. But I regret, too, that the European Union is not doing more to push China in the right direction. Two days ago, on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Union proclaimed its commitment to the ‘promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world as a cornerstone of our external action policy’. And yet, two weeks ago, Messrs Barroso and Socrates left the summit early, having secured Europe’s economic interests, leaving officials to negotiate the conclusions – conclusions which, unsurprisingly, made little mention of human rights, supported the lifting of the arms embargo and opposed Taiwan’s bid to join the United Nations. They did much to undermine Mr Solana’s carefully crafted words the previous month. I wonder what the world is coming to when the European Union, the self-styled protector of universal, interdependent and indivisible human rights, fails to speak out clearly against one of the world’s worst human rights abusers. I suspect that both the Chinese and others may come to regret the decision to host the Olympic Games in Beijing. The Chinese authorities themselves promised that they would bring a greater climate of freedom and openness. And yet figures from Human Rights Watch suggest that abuses have increased in the last seven years. Not only does China continue to execute more people than the rest of the world combined but it has clamped down dramatically on internal dissent and media freedom in advance of the Games. These developments violate the spirit of the Olympic Charter. They are in direct contravention of commitments made by the Beijing authorities themselves in the Host City Contract which they signed with the International Olympic Committee. That contract has not been made public. Why? Because, if the world saw the complete and total disjunction between Chinese promises and Chinese practices, we would have no choice but to boycott Beijing in the same way that we boycotted apartheid South Africa. I do not believe in boycotts. I have also maintained that engaging with a China committed to reform and opening would bring greater fruits than empty threats. But President Hu Jintao has to accept that a deal is a deal. The Host City Contract, the human rights clause in the Chinese Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – these are promises made to China’s citizens. If China wants the Olympics to prove its legitimacy and credibility to the world, then in return it must prove that it is willing to honour its human rights commitments: by improving media freedom in line with the Olympic pledges, by suspending the death penalty in line with United Nations demands, by ceasing its support for military dictators from Burma to Darfur and by allowing elections by universal suffrage in Hong Kong. That is how China can win its place at the heart of the international community.

 Mr President, when Member States ratify the Reform Treaty, as we hope and believe they will, we can look forward, at long last, to a revitalised European Union – a Union with the capacity to confront new challenges, with the humility to listen to its citizens and with the political will to act. Ratification of the Treaty cannot come a moment too soon, and my Group thanks you, Mr Zapatero, for your efforts to speed up the process. My Group sees no need for a group of wise people to ponder Europe’s future. We have been there, done that, and even have the T-shirts to prove it. It was called ‘the period of reflection’ and it has come to an end. We are midway through the Lisbon Strategy and are only now making progress in growth and jobs. We are completing the single market, freeing up the potential of Europe’s entrepreneurs. We are opening legal migration pathways to help both developing and developed economies. Now is not the time to go back to a French drawing board, nor to follow a new British plan for a glorified free trade zone. Those visions are just views from the margins, packaged as majority opinion. They are not where consensus lies. The majority of our citizens want the Union to deliver a strong and growing economy. They want more EU involvement across the board, more involvement in combating terrorism, more cooperation in security and defence, and more action on the environment. Then, and only then, can Europe become a global player with the capacity to bring about lasting change. For how can we assure growth and jobs if Europe retreats into protectionism? How can we combat climate change if we fail to act in concert? How can we spread peace, prosperity and justice in the world if Europe bickers at the sidelines? That is why Europe needs more politicians who are prepared to lead and to take a pan-European approach. Mr Zapatero, by uniting the 18 friends of the Constitution in Madrid, you proved that your vision of an open, integrated and competitive Europe is one shared by many. It is that vision of Europe that progressives from all parties in this House want to see thrive and expand. The ALDE Group will work together with all those who share that vision and live up to it, whether on the right, on the left or in the centre, to ensure Europe moves forward. What we will not tolerate are those who profess such a vision but fail to live up to it. Prime Minister, Spain is often quite rightly praised for its social and economic transformation since joining the Union. We need others to follow your example and pursue your ambition for a prosperous and open Europe. (Applause from the centre and left)

 Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on a point of order. Independently of any party political debate, it is highly unwise of Commissioners to get involved in party political matters in their own countries or in anybody else’s country. I think it is not unreasonable that this House should remind the Commission of its duties in this regard. (Applause from the left)
 Graham Watson,

 Mr President, we have just heard the language of the past:  Die Rede der Vergangenheit!
  Others know, often better than we, that we already live in a global society. India, China and Brazil have caught the wave of opportunity and they are riding it high, while too much of Europe fears the wave crashing over it. When President Sarkozy addressed us yesterday, he spoke of ‘different possible futures for the Europe of tomorrow’, putting our policies for competition, energy and enlargement up for debate. Mr Barroso’s expression during much of that speech told us more than all of his words this morning. If Europe sits on its hands because national leaders – citing citizens’ concerns – contest the EU’s agenda, we will miss the chance to shape globalisation in Europe’s collective interests. It is not citizens we need to convince, it is Member States. Survey after survey has shown that most of our citizens see the European Union, not national government, as best placed to manage globalisation. Look how the earthquake of globalisation is shaking Europe’s body politic. Some on the right are retreating, in the face of global challenges, from Conservatism into nationalism, or from Christian democracy into Christian autocracy. The fissure of globalisation runs right through the EPP. On the left, Kurt Beck and his friends are holding back much needed reforms. Franz Müntefering saw that and that is why he has voted with his feet. And yet the visionaries see the need for reform and they have written it into the new European Socialist manifesto, adopted appropriately in Oporto. The division in our politics is no longer between left and right over economic policy but between those who respond to global challenges by pulling up the drawbridge and those who – with Liberal Democrats – advocate the open society. Mr Barroso, you have majority support in this House for your Commission’s approach to globalisation. But it is not a majority based on one political family. Indeed, it may even prise apart and refashion Europe’s political families. Globalisation will increasingly shape our politics. Not globalisation in the rather narrow economic sense defined in this communication – although a stable euro and effective competition rules and market regulation are in all of our interests – but in its wider, more holistic sense, encompassing world population growth and migration; climate change and energy security; and internationally organised crime linked to terrorism. Is that not the validation we need to ‘act on a continental scale’, as this document urges, to utilise our ‘critical mass’ to ‘enable Europeans to shape globalisation’, as the Commission’s communication demands? If so, Mr Barroso, where are your policies? Your timetable? Your comprehensive approach? We were promised action: instead we are proffered a paper which is rich in rhetoric but rather poor in proposals. This cannot be the final word in Europe’s response to globalisation. I await your single market review, to see how you will drive growth and jobs in difficult terrain, and your legal migration policy, hoping it encompasses the concerns of the countries of origin. My colleagues and I await urgent action on cutting energy use and fighting cross-border crime. We believe, too, that social health and economic vitality are both important. If we are creating a global market, we need a new global social contract, reconciling the competing demands of flexibility and fairness because, as Martin Luther King taught us, ‘injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere’. So the Union must bring together the Lisbon agenda with its focus on competitiveness, the Cardiff agenda with its focus on social rights, and the Gothenburg agenda with its focus on the environment. The world needs a strong, united Union to counter injustice, conflict and poverty wherever they are found because we are one of the few players capable of tackling global issues and, if we do not take the lead, nobody will. That means stopping the hypocrisy of trade tariffs and fashioning a fair deal for developing countries in Doha; clinching a contract on carbon emissions in Bali, using our collective influence to get America on board; and building an international approach to financial markets, focusing on regulatory cooperation, convergence of standards and equivalence of rules. Resolving these challenges in fairness to everybody needs more, not less, globalisation. For we live in an interconnected world, a world that requires solidarity at global level as much as it requires solidarity between European citizens. And we must look forward, with Victor Hugo, to the day when the only battlefields are those of markets open for business and the human spirit open for ideas.

 Mr President, I know that my colleague tried to interject when you raised it, but I think it would be helpful if I made one thing clear to the Chamber: we are not seeking to have a debate with the Commission and the Council about this; we know how little time we have with the Council this week. But if there could be a statement from the Commission and we could have a debate on that basis, then that would be sufficient.
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, most of us recognise the benefits of migration. The Member States which have opened their borders to migrants from other Member States have not seen a rise in unemployment; rather, they have seen a growth in productivity, a rise in economic growth and the creation of new jobs. It is the old, old story. The incomers do jobs that the natives do not want to do, they work hard, they cost little and they bring new ideas. But it is important to recognise that some people cross borders not wishing to work – or at least not wishing to work legally. European Union law recognises this, as you have laid out, Commissioner. While giving the right to reside in other Member States, it allows the host state to limit the right of residence to three months if there is no means of subsistence and to terminate that right if there is a threat to public order. One of the great successes of our Union has been this right to move freely, now enjoyed by millions of citizens in their studies, in their working lives, in retirement. It is not without its challenges and, just as the Jews, a people lacking a homeland, were often unwelcome in ages past, so today the Roma, some nine million people, are discriminated against in many host countries. Yet to equate the Roma people with the country of Romania, even if many of them are Romanian citizens, is to misunderstand the nature of both. You might as well equate them with the city of Roma. European Union funds have been made available for the integration of the Roma. We are working with George Soros and his Decade of Roma Inclusion. But we need all Member States to sign up to that and a common Community framework strategy for Roma inclusion if this is to work. It is a pity that Italy did not draw down any of these funds. Spain drew down some EUR 52 million and Poland some EUR 8 million. But it is not only a lack of foresight on the part of the Italian Government; it is also matched by a lack of foresight on the part of the Commission. I think Mr Barroso was wrong when he said in his interview in La Repubblica 
yesterday that it is inconceivable that European Union authorities should promote integration on the ground. It should not be inconceivable. I share, Mr Frattini, the views of Mr Schulz. You should not be playing party politics in this matter. This House demands that you concentrate on your current responsibilities, not on your possible future career. Italians know as well as others the vulnerability of migrant communities. In 1893, at Aigues-Mortes in France, Italian salt workers in the Peccais were lynched in xenophobic attacks about the protection of local jobs. But one of the great achievements of the Union is that such pogroms are a piece of the past. Too often, nonetheless, democracies are run by crisis management. It is, perhaps, more evident in Italy than elsewhere. But if there are problems in Italy, there will be problems in other countries too. If the right of residence abroad is an EU right, we cannot allow Member States to rewrite the exceptional provisions, as the Italian Government has done in its decree. There is nothing to stop a country giving powers to prefects to deal with it as long as there is a right of appeal. An appeal to a justice of the peace who is not a legal expert is insufficient, just as is the use only of Italian or English in legal documents. But I trust the Italian Parliament will correct these provisions and ensure consistency of the national legislation with EU provisions. For us, this is the first real case of the European Parliament overseeing the application of justice and home affairs legislation, together with national parliaments. We need to look not only at what does not work, but at what does work, and we need your active commitment, Commissioner, in that task. (Applause from the centre and left)

 Mr President, May’s summit in Samara exposed the cracks in our strategic partnership with Russia – on energy, on Kosovo and on human rights. Those fissures have become fault lines that are now so deep and so wide that we are hard pressed to say how meaningful ‘partnership’ based on common values can be pursued. By Mr Putin’s own admission, ‘Russia will not soon become, if it ever becomes, a country where liberal values have deep historical roots’. How long can we go on ignoring the growing evidence? Not that Russians refuse the cultural trappings of the West, because President Putin has spoken time and again of his country’s place at the cultural heart of Europe. No, this vehemence, this denial, is directed primarily against what President Barroso calls Europe’s ‘sacred values’ – values like freedom, democracy	and the rule of law, which are conspicuously absent in Russia today. Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra was right. From the Council and the Commission we have heard too much Realpolitik
 and not enough Moralpolitik
. Our relationship with Russia is strategic, certainly, but it cannot be described as a partnership. We need a pragmatic approach, cooperating where we can on issues of mutual concern, like border crossings, energy supply, and joining the WTO – although yesterday’s announcement on price controls on foodstuffs suggests a return to the economic policies of the past. Some progress can be made with Russia, but without the fanfare, followed by frustration, which marks too many EU-Russia summits. A bit more honesty is needed, too, as Russia comes up to two major elections. If human cloning were better developed, President Putin would probably run for both President and Prime Minister following the Kaczyńskis’ example in Poland! For a country which overturned oligarchy back in 1917, it is quite incredible that a new autocracy is gaining ground, and we should not cut down our criticisms for fear of endangering a partnership which exists but on paper. Only when an independent judiciary, freedom of expression and democracy exist as more than sound bites and when journalists, opposition parties, and NGOs can operate without fear of retribution, can Europe stand in solidarity with Russia. It is for that reason that my Group sought a resolution to close this debate, and over 300 MEPs backed our calls. We must be prepared to put on paper what we say in public and refute those who say this House is nothing but a glorified talking shop. The Reform Treaty promises Parliament a real say on external action for the first time. So let us raise our game to meet the challenge and deliver at the summit a message that President Putin cannot ignore.
 Graham Watson  (ALDE

 Mr President, I rise on a completely different matter. I should just like to express, on behalf of many in my Group and I am sure of many others, our thanks to you for organising this presentation of the LUX Prize. It is the kind of thing we have not done as a Parliament before. It is the kind of thing we should do, and, as a former Swedish Prime Minister once said, ‘politicians would do well to go the cinema more often’. (Applause)
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, it is fitting that the Reform Treaty should be signed in the city which Caesar once named ‘Felicitas Julia’, because it has overcome years of attack, siege, even last-minute subterfuge, to emerge bloodied and bruised, yet more or less intact, as the blueprint for a more democratic and transparent European Union. So Felicitas, Jose. May your name, like Caesar’s, forever be associated with the historic changes you wrought in Lisbon – changes like normalising codecision, ending the tyranny of Council vetoes, placing energy, and justice and home affairs, under democratic scrutiny: these changes give our Union the capacity to confront the challenges of globalisation. (Laughter)
 It is a pity that the Treaty is not simpler to digest, but – after being butchered by the ballpoint pens of civil servants from 27 Member States – what would you expect? Your famous poet Fernando Pessoa once wrote: ‘No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance unless some stupidity is mixed in with it’. Well, in this case, the culprit was national interest, which watered down, or rendered indecipherable, policies and practices that are in all of our interests. Some of the national horse trading you engaged in made it look like comedy descending into farce: deciding that Austrian universities can break the law for another five years while the policemen look the other way, or creating two classes of European citizen: those with fundamental rights and those without. Or suggesting that the President of the European Parliament should forsake his right to vote; or, indeed, that Council has the right to determine Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. But the real tragedy is this: we saw not a single national leader return home flying the flag for Europe. Instead, they crowed about the opt-outs and the derogations and the exclusions which disfigure the text before us today. How do you guys expect to convince the people if you sound so unconvinced yourselves? If the poverty of aspiration implicit in a minimalist treaty is reflected in your poverty of enthusiasm? Look, it is your right to act as you choose, but it is also your responsibility. The only thing this Parliament need regret amongst the many successes is the process. The codes of transparency and democracy which drove the Constitutional Convention were a good deal preferable to secretive summits, and backroom deals in the wee small hours of Thursday morning. Issues of such importance should not be decided in such a kamikaze manner. (Applause)
 Nonetheless, again: congratulations. I propose a toast, with my glass half full: two cheers for the Lisbon Treaty. Let us hope its advances move us forward faster, and convert cynicism into renewed belief. (Applause)

 Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166, and with reference to Rules 45, 77, 89, 113 and 155. We took a decision yesterday that we would have a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit this week, and my Group believes that we should stick to that. I know there is an attempt to try to revote that decision, but I hope the House will sensibly see off such a narrow-minded approach to politics. (Applause)
 Graham Watson,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group

 Mr President, it has indeed been the practice of this House in the past, on matters of major importance such as the EU-Russia Summit, to have a debate followed by a resolution. There are many things that need to be said and many messages that this Parliament needs to send to those who will represent the Union at that summit. We should indeed send a firm message to the Russians and a firm message to the people who will represent us at the summit, with the beliefs of this House behind it. My Group would therefore support that move. (Applause)
 Graham Watson,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Sócrates must feel like England’s Henry V before the battle of Agincourt: hostile governments preparing for a fight, intent on weakening, even perhaps vetoing, treaty reform. President-in-Office, your Prime Minister must hold firm to Europe’s red lines and he must deliver next week a treaty able to underpin a strong, responsive and effective Union. So it is ‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more’, for what should be the final battle in this constitutional war. This Parliament will be your foot soldiers. We know that failure to agree on treaty reform would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. Why? Because the status quo has not worked, does not work and never can work. What Council unanimity means in practice is that essential legislation is either shelved or lowered to the level of the common denominator. In an increasingly cut-throat, globalising world, where challenges like climate change, migration and terrorism demand radical responses, the lowest common denominator is just not good enough. It may not be the Constitution but, for all its legalese, the Reform Treaty is a document which can quietly revolutionise Europe. It develops democracy, putting codecision and qualified majority voting at the heart of decision-making. It favours subsidiarity, with a clearer division of competences, reinforcing the role of national parliaments and the Union’s single legal personality, and it helps transparency, extending the ordinary legislative procedure to cover freedom, security and justice – an area where laws which breach the spirit of a rights-respecting Union have been made behind closed doors for too long. The draft text of your amending Treaty is not without its faults: the loss of Europe’s symbols is a blow to federalists, as is the fudge on voting systems wrought by the Poles. But we can live with them, so long as the Ioannina Compromise is not anchored in the Treaty for all time. One thing we cannot live without, however, is a definition of European citizenship in Article 8 of the Treaty of European Union, because citizenship is a symbol which, unlike a flag or an anthem, has a real life, real implications for over 450 million people. Similarly, calling our Foreign Minister the ‘High Representative’ is no grave cause for concern, but a High Representative who is merely a puppet of the Council certainly would be. Parliament and the Commission must unite to ensure that the joint character of the external action service is respected in full, and that the Court of Justice oversees the use of personal data within the common foreign and security policy. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we cannot have two classes of citizen. That goes entirely against the spirit of European integration and we must do our damnedest to ensure that British and Polish opt-outs are not preserved in perpetuity by demanding a clause allowing revocation without reconvening the IGC. It is not only opt-outs we must guard against: it is also ‘opt-ins’. If not properly formulated, they could allow governments first to water down, and then to wash their hands of, essential Community laws in justice and home affairs after five years of dialogue and debate. If certain countries cannot accept reasonable compromise, our message should be this: they should start thinking about an amicable divorce from the Union and cease holding it hostage to their own vested interests, for the interests of Europe must take precedence over these. (Applause)
 So I urge the Council, the Commission and our own representatives, in Shakespeare’s words: ‘Stiffen your sinews ..., Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height’ in defence of our common interest. (Applause)

 Mr President, what could better illustrate the need for a common European immigration policy than the case of the Tunisian fishermen? Everything about that tragic event – from the migrants on a rubber boat on the high seas, to the people smugglers who put them there and the authorities who jailed their rescuers – is testament to the failure of Europe’s approach to migration. With every human tragedy, during a desperate do-nothing decade, Liberals and Democrats have asked one simple question: how many people must perish before governments see that lifting the drawbridge of Fortress Europe serves nobody’s interests? Managing migration is as much in our interests as in the interests of those seeking our shores or prepared to die trying. While populism has propelled a policy forged in the furnace of fear, let us face the facts. Fact number one: over the next 20 years, Europe will lose 20 million workers – workers who staff our service industries and whose taxes fund services for our citizens. Fact number two: national governments are deterring the people Europe needs if we are to compete – indeed, to survive – in a cut-throat global market. Eighty-five per cent of the best brains go to America and Australia, put off by our bureaucracy, our bloody-mindedness and our barriers to free movement. Fact number three: of those migrants who reach Europe, only 3 in 20 are skilled; most are unskilled, desperate and dispossessed. Commissioner Frattini’s proposals address one half of this problem, building on Ms Hennis-Plasschaert’s ideas for a European Green Card to fill the skills gaps. But his ‘Blue Card’ plan has its own gaps: no mention, for example, of the workers that we need in the catering, healthcare or tourism sectors. It could address economic and demographic challenges if accompanied by free movement of workers from the new EU Member States, but it does little to counter the challenge of illegal migrants along our southern borders. Let us make no mistake: the Commission’s cosy calculation that we can take the best and leave the rest will not work. Pushed by poverty, hunger, squalor and war, people will keep crossing the Mediterranean whether they fit our criteria or not. Why? Because our agricultural and fisheries policies are out-pricing their products and raiding their natural resources. Of course we must patrol Europe’s borders. The Moreno Sánchez report is right to demand that Frontex be given the budget, the staff and the equipment needed to do its job – although suspending Gibraltar from Frontex, equivalent to leaving a hole in the fence, frankly beggars belief. Longer term, however, only a comprehensive EU policy that punishes the people smugglers, provides legal routes in and creates hope where there is despair can counter prevailing trends. The truth is we have only one choice in dealing with developing countries: we take their goods or we take their people. If we want to let fewer in, then we must help more at home, as Ms Gruber’s report rightly says. That is why the Portuguese Presidency must redouble its efforts to bring down Europe’s farm tariffs and bring Doha to a successful conclusion and why the Commission must develop a generous agenda for Africa, linking money and market opening to respect for human rights and the rule of law, to give people hope of a better life at home. Mr Lobo Antunes, Mr Frattini, hold your next Council meeting in the immigration hall on New York’s Ellis Island. Learn from our history of wandering westwards as you plan for the EU-Africa Summit in December. Migration will not go away: it is driven by the heady cocktail of despair and hope, it follows the law of supply and demand, but it has the capacity, if properly managed, to enrich and energise Europe. (Applause)

 Mr President, if we go back just over 2 000 years, we will recall that in the autumn of 68 bc the world’s only superpower suffered a terrorist attack by a band of loosely organised pirates, and in panic the Roman Senate granted Pompey, at least according to Plutarch, ‘absolute authority and uncontrolled power over everyone’ through the Lex Gabinia
. By the oldest trick in the book, the military subverted liberty, democracy and the constitution with the assent of Rome’s frightened citizens, and it took 1 800 years for mature democracy to resurface in Europe. Now, once again, laws that take away our freedoms risk entering by the back door. I welcome the oral questions that colleagues have tabled today, with their very specific questions to Council and Commission. I do not argue that counter-terrorism laws are unnecessary. The arrest yesterday of three people in Germany and the arrest this morning of another three in Denmark show the continuing threat that terrorists pose to our society. My Group is united in its belief that we need more judicial cooperation to make Europol and Eurojust as effective as possible. We backed the European Arrest Warrant to the hilt, trusting the Council to put minimum procedural guarantees in place. We would support a European FBI. Liberals and Democrats are not soft on crime. Indeed, we are astonished at the failure of Europe’s right-wing-dominated Council to find a coherent approach to a matter of law and order. What we are saying, however, is that laws must be proportionate to threats. And indeed, if the threat is so great, why has the Council not moved to replace its anti-terrorism coordinator since the last one left in March? Mr President-in-Office, you have told us that you are ‘reflecting on the best way of ensuring cooperation’. Well, the terrorists have had six months while you have been reflecting. You tell us that ‘the United States has the leading role in counter-terrorism’. We want the European Union to set its own policy. You tell us that the European Parliament has, and I quote, ‘a primordial role’, but that primordial role turns out to be a courtesy meeting once every six months with the chairman of our committee. I welcome Commissioner Frattini’s agreement today to evaluate with Parliament the effectiveness of European Union policy, and I hope the Council Presidency will come along with him for that debate. Since 9/11, we have had a counter-terrorism strategy, an action plan, a framework decision and several cooperation initiatives. None of these has been thoroughly and openly evaluated, let alone by Europe’s democratic institutions. The Council and the Commission should involve Parliament in a comprehensive review of all the measures adopted thus far. Here in Parliament, we should be insisting on sunset clauses for anti-terror laws so that legislation susceptible to abuse does not remain on the statute books any longer than necessary. We are now on to the third and final PNR agreement, for example, an agreement which in perpetuity gives up certain rights for uncertain benefits. My Group questions whether security really demands that the United States Government knows our dietary preferences. Commissioner Frattini, you tell us that 85% of citizens are strongly in favour of European action. Mr Lobo Antunes, you tell us that the Presidency has no doubt that its measures are supported by citizens. Have the two of you not passed through an airport this summer? Have you not heard the young women asking why their lipstick has to be confiscated before they board an aeroplane? Have you not heard the old ladies cry out in frustration when their toenail scissors are taken away? Have you not listened to the people infuriated at how anti-terror laws are being exploited for commercial gain? My local airport now charges people 50 pence for a plastic bag into which travellers have to put their toothpaste. Constituents have written to me about how much is being charged for bottled water air-side of the security controls. The Lex Gabinia
 was a classic illustration of the law of unintended consequences because it fatally subverted the institutions it was supposed to protect. I hope that Europe’s anti-terror laws will not end up doing the same. Karl Popper once said, ‘We must plan for freedom, and not only for security, if for no other reason than only freedom can make security secure’. (Applause)

 Mr President, President-in-Office, the programme that you have presented combines clear goals with ample ambition. Success is not immanent, but Liberals and Democrats have high hopes of a European Union double act under the two Josés. Indeed, you appear to compete for the laurels of economic liberalism. As Britain’s newspaper the Daily Mirror might say, ‘It’s the only way, José!’ Who, if not you two, could convince Europe’s governments of the beauty of Lisbon and the importance of its agenda? Put the ‘is on’ back into ‘Lisbon’ – the need to consolidate public finances, the commitment to financial discipline and debt management, the drive to complete and strengthen the single market. Yes, even in the face of populist opposition in your own parties. It is not just in Asia that the free market has lifted millions out of poverty – it has done the same for 50 million people in the EU in the last 10 years alone. Most importantly, there is a need for sustainable economic recovery in Europe to be built on job creation rather than on rigging the rate of exchange to ratchet up export-driven growth. Therefore, my group particularly welcomes your initiative to open the discussion on flexicurity. We have to modernise social protection and benefit systems to face the challenges of a global market. Let us protect workers, not uncompetitive jobs. Our social safety net should protect not failing businesses but rather those in them, helping them to find new employment opportunities. The only European social model that matters to me is the one that preserves our prosperity by preparing our people for the future. And, yes, if we talk about the future, let us not forget the fight against climate change. Let us look at how we can merge the Gothenburg and Lisbon Agendas and use innovation in green technologies to help us be more innovative, create more jobs and lead the world in setting the climate change agenda. President-in-Office, you are right to place an emphasis on Africa – discovered, exploited and then abandoned by Europeans. The fact that you have called the first EU-Africa summit in seven years says it all. It has been the forgotten continent for far too long. Africa needs Europe, and Europe needs Africa if we are to deal successfully with migration, disease and climate change. China offers money for natural resources and weapons for money. That is the road of 21st century economic colonialism and it is the wrong way forward for Africa. But Europe must avoid talk of the dimensions of empire. Let us learn from the past and forge a new and generous partnership. In justice and home affairs, we appreciate the fact that your Presidency will focus on a series of measures strengthening the area of justice in the European Union. After the revealing comments by Germany’s Interior Minister, Mr Schäuble, my group will be on the guard against the erosion of civil liberties that underpin our society. (Applause)
 We want to see the framework decision on procedural safeguards agreed in the Council as a necessary accompanying measure to the European arrest warrant. And we caution against a response to terrorism which changes the nature of our society by fettering the freedoms for which you fought in the Carnation Revolution. Two weeks ago, this House applauded the Council for agreement on a mandate for the IGC, but last week we learned from some of your colleagues in the Council that they were hollow words. Well, that was rather an ephemeral victory. I believe I speak not only for my group but for many colleagues in this House when I urge that the package agreed at the June Summit should not be unravelled. From a school on the Sagres peninsula, your country gained world repute as a nation of navigators. As President-in-Office, you will need those skills to navigate through the treacherous waters of Council negotiations. We wish you good luck and fair winds. Boa sorte!

 President-in-Office, congratulations on a green light for Europe and a grand legacy for your leadership. Action on climate change and energy security had made yours a noteworthy Presidency. Securing agreement for reform of our Union has made it a great
 Presidency. Joseph Conrad once observed ‘Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it consists principally in dealing with men’. (Laughter)
 Nowhere was this truer than in the Council, where many of your counterparts seemed intent on burying Treaty reform. It is a tribute to your character that you convinced, cajoled, and cautioned agreement where none had seemed possible. Who in the months following 2005’s referendum results would have thought that institutional reform was still within reach; that Europe’s leaders would recognise the need for common action on energy security, climate change, foreign policy or shelve requirements for unanimity in the Council in favour of qualified majority voting in 36 new policy areas? We are pleased too that you recognised Europe’s growing political pluralism by giving Parliament three representatives at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. Combined with making justice and home affairs subject to parliamentary scrutiny, this proves that European democracy has come of age and that this House is now an equal partner in governance. Agreement came at a price, however, and that price was not simply a derogation here and an opt-out there. The real casualty was idealism: losing the symbols of our Union and replacing the relative simplicity of the Constitutional Treaty with bureaucratic opaqueness is a pity. As a result, your new Amending Treaty reads like the instructions for building a Japanese pagoda translated into English by the Chinese middle-man. (Laughter and applause)
 As for the content, President-in-Office, the devil will be in the detail. Your propensity to play the fairy godmother means, I am afraid, that the naysayers – die Verfassungsfeinde heissen sie immer noch in Bayern 
– were rewarded in proportion to their negativity, while the friends of the Constitution – the silent majority – received precious little for supporting the Constitution signed by all Member States in Rome. (Applause)
 And so the French and the Dutch struck again with a side-swipe at fair and open markets. The full effects of the British and Polish derogation from the Charter of Fundamental Rights are not yet known. For Liberals and Democrats it beggars belief that a British Prime Minister is depriving UK citizens of the rights which made his country respected – and which are now guaranteed to other citizens – in order to pander to the popular press. (Loud applause)
 Only time will tell whether the changes to the text are cosmetic, or a wholesale attack on Europe’s fundamental civic and market values. However, politics is always a matter of bricolage
. While the result is not flawless, the edifice you have built is sturdy: the roof should not leak as long as the building blocks of progress are cemented by the mortar of determination. Let us remind national leaders here and now that Europe demands give as well as take. Until they resolve to cooperate fully, the Union will never be fit for purpose. President-in-Office, six months is barely long enough for an EU President to shine. However, as the leader who brought us the promise of a permanent President your reign was memorable. Who else can boast of ending deadlock in the Council and ridding us of the much-maligned pillar structure? Who else can claim credit for creating a European Diplomatic Service and a High Representative to boost our role on the world stage, and who else would have achieved so much without action which was hart aber herzlich
? The Portuguese Presidency must harness this momentum to ensure future developments are driven not by events beyond our continent, but, in the best tradition of the European Union, by idealism within. (Applause)

 Mr President, as Mr Schulz said, there can be no justification for the actions of Hamas militants, however badly the Palestinians have been treated. And yet, if one year ago the international community had not reneged on its commitment to democracy in Palestine, if we had not refused dialogue with Hamas moderates and suspended direct aid payments to a freely elected government, the situation would not be as bad as it is today. Financial sanctions designed to force recognition of Israel or to push Hamas out of power altogether have simply made the Palestinians more desperate and prospects for peace more precarious. A two-state Palestine is emerging, riddled by violence, sectarianism and fear, while a two-state solution to the conflict is moving further away. Liberals and Democrats are disappointed – though not surprised – by what has come to pass. A year ago, we warned that Palestinian suffering would lead to greater extremism, particularly in Gaza’s prison conditions, where 1.4 million citizens have been systematically sealed-off and starved of their basic necessities. Last week’s violent takeover of Gaza bespoke a lack of respect for the rule of law, which is a de minimis
 requirement for any legitimate government. If Hamas is not careful, it will have betrayed its cause and, in the words of Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, ‘put the last nail in the coffin’ of the dream of a Palestinian state. Unless we want civil war to triumph over unity, all sides must face the facts: their refusal of dialogue has got them nowhere. A heavy dose of pragmatism is now required – not condemnation, not sanctions, and certainly not a refusal to negotiate. That is the coward’s option and one which will backfire. To that end, my Group welcomes Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s determination to restore security and President Abbas’s commitment to dialogue. We welcome resumption of direct aid to the Palestinian Authority and the prospective release of up to USD 800 million in Palestinian tax revenues by the Israeli Administration. However, we caution against supporting the West Bank administration at the expense of Gaza. If you consider the strip a ‘terrorist entity’ – as Israeli officials have called it – you will not bring the region any closer to peace, you simply create more insecurity as a desperate people, deprived of food and other essentials, decides it has nothing left to lose. Hamas control of Gaza was the nightmare that became reality. However, the European Union must not be prepared to take a back seat and watch as Iran becomes a player in the contest. If this year has taught us nothing else, it is that politics – and politics alone – can create prospects for peace in the Middle East. While Parliament, at least, kept talking, the Council and the Member States took to the sidelines. It is now up to the Council and our Member States to put democracy, human dignity and the rule of law back at the centre of proceedings and work to foster peace in the region. (Applause)

 Madam President, one thing we all know. Those of us here and those protesting at Heiligendamm. The key challenges facing our people; challenges like climate change, energy security and international crime remain unsolved because our institutions of government are no longer fit for purpose. Member States recognised this when they signed the Treaty establishing a Constitution, and yet some now backtrack on those commitments without even attempting ratification. Such an approach is contrary to the spirit of European Union, contrary to common sense, contrary to the interests of Europe’s citizens. As Javier Solana said last month, ‘just when we should be at our most alert, just when the world’s demand for Europe is at its highest, the Union has turned inwards, immersed in a state of institutional crisis’. Acting together, Europe could make a real difference where individual Member States meet only a brick wall. The detention of the Bulgarian nurses is a case in point. As a result of January’s Council, diplomatic pressure from all European Capitals has been brought to bear that could soon bring the nurses’ captivity to an end. We call on the Presidency of this House to demand that the Summit unite in the same manner in support of Alan Johnston, the BBC journalist held in Gaza. And yet on wider issues, matters of crucial importance? Well, as Mark Twain reminded us, when all is said and done much more has been said than done! How can we protect our citizens from abuse of data? How can we ensure energy security? How can we manage migration policy if we fail to equip ourselves with the tools for the job? Are the naysayers serious in saying they will sacrifice good governance for the sake of flags and titles? Can they really defend a system of national vetoes which, as President-in-Office Steinmeier pointed out, castrates key initiatives? Codecision and qualified majority voting must be the norm, not the exception, in European policymaking. June’s European Council is an opportunity to close a barren chapter of non-cooperation and start afresh with a toolkit equipped for the times. This House stands firm in its desire to secure a roadmap for reform that can enter into force by the next European elections. We demand robust Parliamentary participation in the IGC, at which we demand greater and more pluralistic representation. As one of the co-authors of the Constitutional Treaty at the European Convention, this House expects to be treated as such, not consigned to the margins as we were for previous Treaties. If the text is to surmount the perceived lack of legitimacy of the original, then the people’s representatives must be given a voice. That voice will argue against a de minimis
 compromise on the substance of the text. It will insist that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is too important to be downgraded in the manner proposed by the UK, because that way lies differential membership, differential citizenship, differential rights which have no place in a Europe of equals. (Applause)
 The path of the lowest common denominator outcome leads inexorably to a two-tier Europe. Let the faint hearts be warned: this is our best chance to make Europe work for our citizens. We must not and we will not let it go. (Applause)

 Mr President, I rise under Rule 3(3) of the Rules of Procedure to ask you to invoke your presidential powers, defined in Rule 19, to declare inadmissible, and therefore to stop the vote on, the report by Mr Gargani (A6-0198/2007
). This report is in contravention of the Treaties and, in particular, of Articles 12 and 13 of the 1976 Act. It is, therefore, without legal basis, and I ask you to use your presidential powers to declare it inadmissible.

 Mr President, yesterday, in this Chamber, one of Europe’s great champions sketched his vision of a Union fit for the 21st century – a Union that is democratic, transparent and, above all, effective. However, crossing that Rubicon requires firm leadership, Mr Balkenende. The German Presidency has shown its strength by uniting Member States under the banner of the Berlin Declaration. It must pull them together again in the weeks before the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference which follows if we are to win the war of public opinion and unite around a revised Treaty. The stakes are high. Your Foreign Minister, Mr Verhagen, said: ‘In today’s globalised world people are afraid of losing their jobs, their social security, their quality of life’. Yet that is not an argument for less Europe, indeed, it may well be an argument for more Europe. (Applause)
 Europe cannot secure its energy supply, combat climate change or tackle terrorism with a retreat into unilateralism. You, of all people, should know that, Mr Balkenende. For history teaches us that the Netherlands’ golden years – as the wealthiest nation in the 17th-century world – came from uniting the seven provinces, not dividing them. You must convince your citizens that unity and prosperity are inseparable; that inability to make progress on political integration means Europe will lose its place as a global standard-setter and end up at the mercy of powers like Russia with its belligerent energy policy. To take key decisions on jobs, security and quality of life, the Union needs an end to unscrupulous use of national vetoes. To address the democratic deficit, it needs greater democratic accountability. To maintain its international prestige and internal effectiveness, its institutions must change with the times. None of this is possible without the substance of what was agreed in the European Convention, and that substance must be maintained, whatever cosmetic surgery you try to effect on the surface. We are not just talking about ideology here: we are talking about people’s jobs, their quality of life and their long-term prospects. It is time that you, and others like you, retook the initiative and brought Europe back to their people. Nobody here is seeking a European superstate – diversity of customs, history and language will ensure that. However, we are seeking a European ‘superpeople’, a united people. Too often our heads of government have taken the advice of the English Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Bonar Law when he exclaimed: ‘I must follow them; I am their leader’. But populism cannot move Europe forward, nor cement our quality of life, international influence or economic strength – only solidarity can do that. When concerns over the so-called symbols of a superstate – like flags or anthems –supersede debate on real issues, then it is time for a change of strategy. (Applause)
 Your public demands energy security; it demands a European environment policy; it demands common action on migration. From the new Treaty, they will get it, for the tools are already in the text. So sell that to your people, instead of sidestepping the issues. Stop letting the tail wag the dog, and lead the Netherlands back to the heart of European decision-making, as befits the founder status of your country in our Union. In conclusion, Prime Minister, I would say, do as your countryman Justus Lipsius advised: be stoical in adversity, embrace necessity and be constant in your faith in Europe. For your people’s peace, prosperity and security depend upon it. (Applause)

 Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to welcome Mr Prodi back to Parliament. Prime Minister, 50 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed, you have returned Italy to its rightful place at the heart of Europe, and at the heart of the European project. With President Napolitano you have turned the osservato speciale
 into a partner speciale
. Your cabinet, with names like Bonino, Amato and Padoa-Schioppa, fills my colleagues and me with confidence. We hear some criticisms of your first year in government, but we recall the faint hearts who made similarly dismissive remarks about your first year at the Commission. They were proven wrong. Enlargement, the euro: these are the jewels in Europe’s crown, so we will judge a government on its results, not on first appearances. It was Italy which, while others hesitated, led the European Union force into Lebanon, and Italy which pressed for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. You showed the world that Europe can have the vision and the capacity to act in unison for the good of all. We must seize that vision, for Europe’s future strength lies not in insulating itself against injustices, but in confronting the forces of pain and misery and destruction in the world beyond our borders. On our own continent we have healed the hurts of nations. Our interest now, indeed perhaps our survival, depends on exporting in the next 50 years the domestic achievements of the last. Global challenges like climate change, population growth and nuclear proliferation highlight what you have called ‘the inadequacy of unilateralism’. The world needs global mechanisms to create consensus on these matters. And the model? None is better than our Community method, tried and tested over 50 years. And yet, even as Europe comes of age on the international stage, some are seeking to divide us from within. What should we say to the eurosceptics who say that the European Union is no longer fit for service, or that the European dream is menaced by globalisation, or that integration threatens national identity? They listen, but they do not hear. Mr Prodi, you wisely followed the advice of Cavour, who told us that he had discovered how to deceive diplomats. He said, ‘I tell them the truth, and they never believe me’. As you told us in Berlin, marking Europe’s 50th birthday:  (IT) 
‘To create we need common sense, patience, faith, and also a grain of folly.’  A grain of folly, of self-belief, as well as grit and determination are indeed needed to face the future. For now is not the time for apathy or egocentrism. Our leaders must be bold: more Europe, not less, is the key to competitiveness; more Europe, not less, is the key to security; more Europe, not less Europe, is the key to a just world. That is why it is vital to reach an institutional settlement at next month’s intergovernmental conference. Only stronger institutions can build a stronger Europe. Mr Prodi, it was Leonardo da Vinci, your compatriot, who taught us:  (IT) 
‘He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind’.  Thank you for holding true to your vision. (Applause)

 Mr President, on this day in 1945 Europe fêted Russia’s День Победы – their Day of Victory – and the victory of freedom, law and human dignity over the forces of Nazi hate. Then, we stood together in common cause. Now, a symbol of that same war that brought us together has locked us in a destabilising dispute. I know the Commission advises dialogue to end the stand-off between Tallinn and Moscow over the Russian War Statue. However, ‘a dialogue is more than two monologues’, as the former US Ambassador to the CSCE, Max Kampelman, once said. When intimidation triumphs over negotiation, it can no longer be business as usual between the European Union and Russia. That is why my group decided this morning to withdraw its support for the motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia summit. The problem is not what it says, but what it does not say. The Russians need a clear signal that enough is enough.  (DE) 
Mr Gloser, Commissioner Verheugen, what you have given us are fine words, no more than soft words, but no action. (Applause)
  So let me make you a direct proposal: postpone the summit until Russia is prepared to cement a constructive relationship with the Union and condemn all violence against EU staff and property. (Applause)
 We must stand together with Estonia. We must stand together with Poland. Democratic solidarity is more important than bilateral oil and gas deals. (Applause)
 And we must not blink first if we are serious about maintaining pragmatic cooperation with Putin’s government and garnering consensus on Kosovo’s final status. Of particular concern to Liberals and Democrats is Russia’s record on Human Rights. Only when an independent judiciary and freedom of expression and democracy cease to exist solely as sound-bites, and when journalists, opposition parties, and NGOs are able to operate without fear of retribution, will Russia have proved its commitment to establishing a common space of freedom, security and justice, as implied in its membership of the Council of Europe and as it signed up to at the St Petersburg Summit. The arrest and detention of opposition voices, whether Kasparov or Khodorkovsky, has done nothing to indicate that times are changing. December’s elections to the Duma, not to mention next year’s presidential elections, will be a litmus test in this regard, as will Russia’s actions in Chechnya, where torture and secret detention continue to give cause for concern. Dialogue requires progress on energy security, where, with Gazprom more about politics than profit, the prospect of further strong-arm tactics lingers. We owe it to Member States like Latvia and Lithuania, which have fallen victim to energy politics, to deliver a response that has more bite than bark. That means insisting that future agreements between the European Union and Russia be linked to the principles of the Energy Charter Treaty and the Kyoto Agreement to ensure a more secure and sustainable future. Yes, there are some signs of progress in justice and home affairs, where we are negotiating border agreements with the Baltic States, visa-free travel and the readmission of illegal migrants in line with our joint strategy. However, the fruits of constructive dialogue are too few and far between. Today’s ‘Victory Day’ should remind us that, only 60 years ago, interdependence helped us face down common challenges. It can do so again, provided we have the courage to act! (Applause)

 Mr President, after 9/11 Le Monde
 announced: ‘Nous sommes tous Américains’
. Times have changed. On economic, environmental and ethical grounds the United States Government has been shredding the values for which America enjoyed our respect. The challenge for the EU Member States is to resist US moves towards unilateralism, whether on trade policy, over Kyoto or in respect for international law. This will require the frank, forthright, and sometimes fraught, transatlantic dialogue on issues like the visa waiver scheme, extradition and ‘open skies’, which our Member States have thus far resisted. Indeed, President Bush succeeds in ‘divide and rule’ of Europe at least as well as President Putin. This summit is a time for some home truths. Removing regulatory barriers and harmonising standards between the world’s largest trading partners must be our top priority. However, it should not come at the expense of securing a successful Doha round before Mr Bush’s mandate expires on 1 July. We must also use the summit to force recognition of the greatest security threat of the modern age – climate change – and to make the Americans agree to stabilise and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Security Council debated the issue for the first time last week, underlining the seriousness of the situation. But we must insist, too, that the administration clarify its position over allegations of torture, secret prisons and extraordinary rendition in the conduct of the war on terror. Not only is it the right thing to do but it is the only thing to do to restore America’s reputation. In the long term, only wider democratic scrutiny involving this House and the US Congress and Senate, perhaps under a transatlantic Schengen-style system, can strengthen our strategic relationship and prevent the kind of legal limbo that we are experiencing with passenger name recognition data or with SWIFT payment transactions. Success in the war on terror rests on balancing freedom and security, not sacrificing our civil liberties. The turmoil in Iraq is proof of what happens when we get the balance wrong. The US and the European Union should be helping to repair the damage and showing solidarity with Iraq’s two million refugees. The Americans have taken exactly 466 Iraqi refugees since 2003. We know that they do not want to acknowledge a flight of refugees that is a symptom of their failure, but we need a clear and comprehensive aid budget and an agreement on sharing the burden of asylum claims. Finally, our negotiators must not be afraid to take the initiative. Paul Wolfowitz has undermined the World Bank’s moral authority. Our message to them must be that it is time for him to go. In conclusion, I owe to an American poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the thought that there is no such thing as history, only biography. Europe’s leaders should bear in mind that they will be judged as individuals for the courage they summon up in Washington.

 Mr President, I rise because a member of my group, Mr Geremek, is to have his mandate as a Member of the European Parliament revoked by his own government with effect from 19 April. The powers under which the Polish Government is revoking Mr Geremek’s mandate are a ‘lustration’ or monitoring law adopted just a couple of months ago which is currently under legal challenge in Poland’s constitutional court. This law requires all journalists, academics and elected MPs to sign a declaration stating that they never collaborated with the Communist-era security services. Mr Geremek has signed such declarations in the past. His refusal to sign in this case is on moral rather than political grounds. He rightly objects to the witch-hunt which the Polish Government seeks. (Loud and sustained applause)
 I would ask three things, Mr President. I would ask first of all whether Mr Kaczyński, who met Mr Pöttering last week, raised this issue with him; secondly, whether it is right and indeed possible for a Member of this House to be stripped of their democratically-elected mandate in this way; and thirdly, whether you would give this House the assurance that Parliament will act to protect Mr Geremek’s right to exercise his democratically-elected mandate with all possible haste. (Loud and sustained applause)

 Mr President, on 13 April, Members of this House due to speak at a multinational conference in Singapore were refused permission to address the conference by the Singapore Government. Indeed, they were told that if they spoke, they would be immediately arrested. This conference was not specifically about Singapore. It was a conference of Liberal and Democrat parliamentarians from Asia and Europe on the development of democracy on both continents. The cooperation between European and Asian members of parliament, which has led to the staging of many such conferences in many different Asian and European countries – at which nobody has been prevented from speaking – has grown out of the work of the Asia-Europe Foundation. Such cooperation is a central part of the Union’s strategy in Asia. Coincidentally, the ban was imposed on the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Asia-Europe Foundation. I ask you to write to the Commission President and the Secretary-General of the Council requesting that they should protest to the Singapore Government in the strongest terms and urging them to reflect on whether Singapore is an appropriate country to host the Asia-Europe Foundation if it acts in this way.

 Mr President, at the very start of his mandate, the High Representative made the Middle East the main focus of his work. We congratulate you on that, High Representative. We admire your indefatigable energy and your diplomatic skills, and we hope that with a new government in Palestine, the European Union will indeed be able to help in setting this country firmly on the road to a lasting peace and to peaceful co-existence with Israel. High Representative, you say that deeds are more important than words, and that we must determine our behaviour towards the new Palestinian Government in response to its actions, but I would urge you, rather, to take the initiative with this new government. It has a great need to establish a functioning administration on its territory. The temporary implementation mechanism is both costly and cumbersome and the commitment of the state of Israel to allowing that new government to work is far from clear. We need to take the initiative, for if we hesitate, we may lose the opportunity to secure a lasting peace and peaceful coexistence. High Representative, you certainly do not lack courage. Your efforts in trying to secure peace in the Middle East and the development of democracy and the rule of law are undertaken in probably the most difficult circumstances. My group agrees with you that a political solution is best in our relations with Iran over the nuclear issue. We commend your efforts to restart negotiations with Mr Larijani. We view UN sanctions as being a last resort and we would urge you, in the contacts and the relationships that you are building, to use all of the Union’s efforts to release the British sailors and marines who are being held there. HMS Cornwall is based in my constituency. Many of the people involved are my constituents. We are very keen to see them released as soon as possible. Perhaps you can also turn your attention again to Libya, to see if we cannot get the Bulgarian nurses back to Bulgaria in time to vote in the European elections on 20 May. (Applause)
 You spoke of Darfur. It has to be at the top of our agenda, not only for the security reasons you mentioned, but because our inability to prevent the first genocide of this century would send the wrong signal about Europe’s role and potential within the world. I urge you to work together with the United States and with other major nations to try to bring a solution there, in particular bringing in UN troops to establish security which the African Union is not capable of achieving. We welcome your renewed emphasis on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. If the United Kingdom and France renew their nuclear weapons, if the USA builds a missile shield, then the message we are sending to the Russians and others is that we are engaging in a new arms race. Quite apart from the fact that this ‘son of star wars’ might turn out to be a Maginot Line in the sky, we should not be engaging in this kind of diplomacy. You say the European Union has no legal powers, but we must discuss the missile shield. However, unless you actually take the initiative and set the agenda, that agenda will be set for you by the actions of the individual Member States. We welcomed the initiative of Commissioner Rehn, when, in the face of growing difficulties with Turkey, he established sanctions by suspending negotiating chapters and brought the Member States around behind him. We would like to see you do that to ensure that we have a common response to the development of this missile shield. High Representative, you are responsible for access to documents. We have talked a lot about the need for an agreement on access to documents in the second and third pillars. These documents are not within the purview of national parliaments, and the Solana/Brok accord gives us no solid legal basis. When our temporary committee on extraordinary rendition asked you last year for the minutes of the Committee of Legal Experts of the Member States, they were given a two page document. We later discovered that there is a fuller, six-page document, and I would simply ask you here today if, in the spirit of loyal cooperation set down in Article 10, you would clarify to this House – perhaps to the Conference of Presidents – whether the minutes received by the chairman of our temporary committee were indeed a full or just a partial record of the proceedings of that meeting. You will appreciate the importance of this matter.

 Chancellor, I congratulate you on your achievements – text and consensus. Your celebration of the Union’s success was both timely and appropriate. It is largely to the European Union that we owe the security, prosperity and opportunity our citizens enjoy. As we sat in Berlin’s Historisches Museum on Sunday morning, two things struck me. The first was your inspired move to engage the European Youth Orchestra for the occasion; it is first class and it deserves better financial support. The second was that of the 31 people on the platform – Heads of State and government, presidents of the institutions et al – you were the only woman. It brought to mind a verse by the poet Robert Burns: ‘While Europe’s eye is fixed on mighty things, The fate of empires and the fall of kings; While quacks of State must each produce his plan, And even children lisp the Rights of Man; Amidst this mighty fuss just let me mention, The Rights of Woman merit some attention.’ Chancellor, you set us an example: we need more women at the highest levels in politics. (Applause)
 Indeed, in current circumstances, perhaps only a woman could have secured agreement. However, I cannot congratulate you on the procedure you chose: a text drafted in the catacombs of the Bundeskanzleramt and signed by the Presidents of the three main institutions should not have the temerity to open with the words ‘We, the citizens of the European Union’. For it is the citizens of the European Union who need to be re-engaged in the task of building Europe. President Barroso was right when he said that the institutions must respect diversity, but the Member States must promote unity. The impressive festivities in Berlin were replicated in too few other European capitals. Until all your colleagues in the European Council actively argue the case for Europe, day in and day out, no solid foundation will exist. Nor does it help, Chancellor, for the European People’s Party, your party, to claim all the credit for building this Union. The drafters of this vainglorious EPP declaration rightly praise Monnet, De Gasperi and Kohl, but their memory is selective at best. Thatcher, Chirac, Berlusconi: they were all EPP leaders too, but you seem to have overlooked their contributions. The Union is not the project of one political party. It belongs to us all. (Applause)
 We hope, Chancellor, that the Berlin Declaration will herald a new departure. We look to the intergovernmental conference you have secured to put in place the institutional building blocks of the Union’s future. The new Europe, the Europe Berlin envisages, should be one where the Union helps its citizens to grasp the opportunities of globalisation and shows them solidarity in facing new global challenges; one where democracy has the upper hand, and our values have the final word. (Applause)

 Mr President, a significant birthday is always a good occasion to take stock. Fifty years ago at the signing of the Treaty of Rome, what was in the minds of Europeans? Well, hope, undoubtedly; optimism, perhaps; but the certainty of success – far from it. And yet the European Union is at the base of the security, prosperity and opportunity which our people now enjoy. We live in a Europe of freedom and security, of prosperity and opportunity and of societies and economies more open than ever before. Our generation has aspired to, and achieved, more than our parents could ever have dreamt of. But the Berlin Declaration must reflect less our pride in the past, more our determination for the future. President-in-Office, the process is depressingly opaque. Everybody likes a surprise on their birthday, but to debate a declaration without even a draft is bizarre! You hinted at what it might contain, President-in-Office. You assure us that the spin doctors in the Bundeskanzleramt are still hard at work, and yet the chance to debate the text will be limited at best, so do not be surprised if many of us feel we are being bounced. We want a declaration that looks ahead to the challenges we face, that gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the values, the aims, the future of the European Union – one which will bring our citizens back on board the European project at a time when more than ever our nations must act together. An enlarged and open Europe needs greater solidarity between its nations and its citizens; economic reform, as recognised at the European Council; and a wider mission to project our values in the world. Faced with the global challenges of world population growth and migration, of climate change, of internationally-organised crime and terrorism, the Declaration gives Member States the opportunity to explain to citizens why now, more than ever, the EU is so important, why we have to engage with countries beyond our borders and cultures beyond our ken. Europeans should not be afraid of this. What has made Europe strong is its openness. A retreat into fortress Europe, the anachronistic idea of nation states and protected economies, or Christian fundamentalism, would only catapult us back in time: a time when Europeans had only one citizenship, only one national identity. Our advice to the German Presidency is: keep it short and simple – the kind of text one might nail on to the door of a church in Wittenberg. Or if the Chancellor is too busy to go that far, at least on the Wittenbergplatz! I hear that the draft is currently running to two pages. If that is true, it is already one page too long. My Liberal and Democrat colleagues in the Committee of the Regions have produced a one-page mission statement for the European Union, which I commend to you. Nine points says all that needs to be said: that European integration has been a success and that we must continue. (Applause)

 Mr President, your experience in this House since direct elections in 1979 has qualified you well and has given you a rare sense of perspective for the post you occupy. I congratulate you on your speech this morning. You have seen the European Union grow from 9 countries in the 1970s to 12 in the 1980s, 15 in the 1990s, 25 and then 27 in this decade, with a queue of countries waiting to join. You have seen the Treaty of Rome supplemented by the Single European Act, the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, and now the draft constitutional treaty, as the common market has been enhanced with a single market, a single currency and policies in justice and home affairs, foreign and security arrangements and now energy. You have also seen – as have some others of us of more recent vintage – a profound change in what the European Union is all about. It is no longer a Union to guarantee peace and security of food supply, but a Union which has to be capable of meeting the three big challenges we face: rapid world population growth and migration, energy resources and climate change, and internationally organised crime linked to terrorism. Hitherto, the drive for the building of this Union has come from within. Increasingly, it comes from beyond our borders and the response of our institutions has been uncertain. There is a malaise affecting our Union which has led to squabbling between the Member States, who, in the name of preserving national sovereignty, are too often giving free rein to global anarchy; and squabbling between our institutions, which turns our citizens cold, like different denominations of the church, arguing about substantiation rather than asking why nobody comes to church any more. Mr Poettering, you have the opportunity to lead this House at a time when it is increasingly becoming the dynamo of European integration. It is increasingly to the European Parliament that Europeans must look: a House resurgent and outspoken, holding the Council and the Member States to account when their action against terrorism rides roughshod over the rights we cherish; forging consensus – which escapes the Commission – on the single market in services or on consumer protection measures; working with national parliaments to scrutinise the executive, ensuring the law is respected. In short, this House is coming of age. Ideology has surpassed nationality as the main determinant of voting behaviour. It is true that this House does not yet possess a right of initiative or the right to propose the President of the Commission, but neither is now unthinkable and increasingly people believe that both would enhance our Union’s culture of democracy. Therefore, Mr Poettering, I hope that you will use your two and a half years to grasp the need for reform of this House; to give us a Parliament better equipped to provide such leadership; a House that meets in full session every week; a House that concentrates on profound political choices rather than voting on hundreds of amendments to move semi-colons; a House that uses its new powers of scrutiny to the full to recall and re-examine our laws. When you were first elected, this Parliament was a consultative assembly, designed to give a pro forma cover to decisions taken by bureaucrats and diplomats. Now it is a cornerstone of our European home. In 13 years of codecision, that one function has developed the organs of this body, and transparency has given oxygen to our bloodstreams. I should like to say to Chancellor Merkel that codecision is now needed in all areas of policy-making if the checks and balances of democracy are to work at European level. The fact is that the Union makes decisions that are binding on Member States without proper democratic or judicial control, exposing us to censure by the Court of Human Rights or the constitutional courts. We had a close shave when the German Constitutional Court examined the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and came very close to contesting its legitimacy. If the German Government, which blocked the use of the passerelle
 clause in Article 42 just a few months ago, really wants to promote democracy in Europe, you will recognise the imperative of qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament as a basis for all law-making, otherwise in your time at the helm you risk looking like the mime artist, Marcel Marceau, appearing to climb a wall but actually going nowhere. Mr President, the years 1914 to 1989 on our continent were a 75-year rage of self-mutilation. This year, with Bulgaria and Romania in our Union, we can put to rest the ghosts of that period. However, the roots of freedom lie in courage. I believe there is a German word ‘Zivilcourage
’: you, Chancellor Merkel and President Barroso need to muster the collective courage to take our Union forward as a true democracy, to create what Winston Churchill called in 1945 ‘a wider patriotism’ and a common citizenship for the distraught people of this turbulent and powerful continent. (Applause)

 Mr President, EU growth in 2006 hit 2.7 % – the highest in six years. Unemployment is at its lowest since 1998, at 7.9 %. One is tempted to say, ‘well done!’, but that 2.7 % growth has to be measured against 9.5 % in China and India, and our 7.9 % unemployment rate against under 5 % in the United States and 4.1 % in Japan. In this light, the Lisbon goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 sounds not only ambitious but unrealistic. We have already dropped the target date. Can we maintain the target? Well, we hold this debate annually; some Member States perennially ignore our exhortations. The Kok Report told us two years ago that the objectives of Lisbon have become muddled and the results are unconvincing. It is because some Member States have tried to muddle through instead of reforming their ways. Lisbon will only work if reform is made Europe-wide. Solidarity cannot mean those governments who have gone through the tough process of reform now having to bail out those who have not. In some countries, even the opposition does not see the need for reform; it makes promises to citizens which cannot be kept and, I am tempted to say:  (FR)
 It might be said that there is a dire need in this case for a reality check.  A knowledge-based economy needs a willingness to learn. We in Europe can learn from each other. Economic growth and low unemployment, a dynamic business environment and high social standards are not mutually exclusive – look at Denmark or Finland. The way to modernise social protection and benefit systems is to bring in more flexibility. Youth unemployment is far too high, but protecting our citizens does not mean that we have to protect uncompetitive jobs. The social safety net should not prop up failing businesses, but help those affected to reintegrate into new business opportunities. My group believes, too, that investing in green technologies is key to containing climate change and catering for energy security in Europe. Energy is literally the driving force of our economy, and, as our Energy Ministers meet this week in Brussels, they must rise to the challenge and have the courage to open up the energy sector to greater competition and flexibility, not just separating infrastructure from supply. Building a true European energy market is important but not sufficient: we also need to cut energy consumption, and I hope the Commission will be even more ambitious in future than it has been. We have got to create incentives for individuals to change their habits and make thoughtful purchases and investments through using the tax system. We also have to deliver proper implementation of European legislation, letting our citizens know what needs to be done, and Member States have to live up to their promises of economic reform so that we can give the green light to Lisbon.

 Madam President, my group welcomes the Commission’s recent focus on energy policy and climate change, its biomass proposal of December 2005, its proposals concerning the ‘standby’ mode for electronic equipment of September 2006, its energy policy this month and today’s announcement of a fuel quality directive. We feel that together these represent an ambitious but not unachievable policy. Such a policy is essential if the Union and its Member States are to live up to their responsibility to citizens, if we are to enjoy secure energy supplies and if we are to persuade other countries to follow our example. If we had heeded the warnings of Californian scientists in the late 1970s, we could probably have prevented climate change. Now we can hope only to contain it. For that reason, Liberals and Democrats deplore the pleadings of German car manufacturers in Bild Zeitung
 and the attempts by some Commissioners to water down emissions targets. (Applause)
 If the Japanese can make hybrid cars, if the French and the Italians can produce cars that are far more efficient, why cannot others as well? I do not often quote Konrad Adenauer in this House – I leave that to my colleagues on the right – but Adenauer was pertinent when he said ‘God placed limits on man’s reason. But not on his stupidity’. (Laughter and applause)
 We will not succeed unless our citizens recognise there is a problem and start changing their habits. Do we really need electric razors or electric curling irons? Do we really need cars that go from 0 to 100 km per hour in less than six seconds if it will destroy our planet in less than six decades? There is a boast of car manufacturers that their cars do 240 km per hour. That may be so, but they emit 360g of CO2 for each kilometre. Stopping this is not hitting jobs. A Belgian Government study last year showed that cutting CO2 emissions has no overall effect on jobs, because there are new high-tech sectors which create new jobs. It is not just on climate issues where new thinking is needed: we need to feed a rapidly growing world population and bring living standards up to the point where population numbers stabilise. There are many ways to do that – growing soya, for example, with the same nutritional value as beef for less than 1% of the inputs. Democracy can no longer be run by crisis management, where serious problems are left untackled until there is a crisis. Where livelihoods and the sustainability of life are at stake, we need a purposeful, proactive approach to our politics, such as that suggested by the President-in-Office today. It is not easy to change people’s habits. There is not enough emphasis in the Commission’s proposals on cutting energy use, but it is essential. HG Wells said ‘human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe’. If the Commission grasps this agenda, if it challenges the Member States rather than deferring to them, then there is hope that the Union will yet command greater support among our citizens. (Applause)

President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats wish you every success for the German Presidency of the European Union. You have presented to us a bold programme entitled ‘Europe Succeeding Together’, firmly in the cooperative tradition of our most powerful Member State. Liberals and Democrats welcome the commitment in the opening paragraph, where you say that European integration is the foundation of our common future and that its dynamic development must continue. I commend to you, Chancellor, the words of the poet Goethe when he wrote:  (DE)
 ‘Bleibe nicht am Boden haften, frisch gewagt und frisch hinaus
’ – bidding us not be rooted to the spot but venture out and risk new things.  Progress will be built on the pillars of a strong economy. I am disappointed that the word ‘social’ appears in this programme almost twice as many times as the word ‘competitive’. The word ‘liberal’ appears only once. I fear this document owes more to the SPD side of your coalition than to others. However, even the SPD in Germany is lagging behind the new socialist consensus at their conference in Oporto. It is no good trying to protect energy giants like RWE or EDF in the hope that they can stand up against GazProm. We need free markets and energy security and there is no contradiction between the two. (Applause)
 We welcome your plans for technology and talent, but you will not do it if you cut the budgets that the European Union has for research, innovation and education. (Applause)
 We will work closely with you on justice and home affairs. You talk of intensive police and judicial cooperation between Member States, but we are deeply concerned and we will work to change your plans, which focus too much on the repressive aspects of policy and not enough on freedom. You said fine words in your speech about tolerance. However, data collection is mentioned in your document, but there is nothing about data protection: there is not a single mention of it in the section on civil rights. (Applause)
 In your document we find border guards, but on development aid policy to relieve the misery that pushes people towards our shores, there are just a few platitudes on the final page. We may be in danger of creating in Europe what Dieter Lattmann once described in your own country as eine lieblose Republik
. If I may cite one sentence from your document, it is this: ‘if a common European area of justice cannot be achieved in the field of civil and criminal law, the European single market will remain incomplete’. I welcome the fact that you see justice and home affairs as part of the European single market, but then why do you stubbornly resist demands from citizens to make policy in the same way as you make policy for the single market: qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision? (Applause)
 You speak of the role of national parliaments, but there is nothing about the role of the European Parliament. You seek to adopt the Prüm Treaty on data-sharing outside Community competence. It is no surprise that a former president of your country, Roman Herzog, said that Germany is no longer a parliamentary democracy because so many of its laws come from Brussels. But we need at least to make Europe a proper parliamentary democracy. In common foreign and security policy too – another area that should come under the first pillar – the EU is incapable. We watch the disintegration of Iraq: last year alone there were 34 000 civilian deaths; people saying that today is better than tomorrow. That is the most urgent geopolitical issue of our time. As you say in your programme, we need a more effective and a more coherent foreign policy. We welcome what you say about the environment. The Green Party in your country may have biodegraded, but it clearly had some impact. We support, in particular, your plans for environmental technology and the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities. We hope you will work towards a European Union budget in 2008 that gives us the means to act. Chancellor, on the Constitution I wish you success. Many in my group are not optimistic that the conditions exist in London, Paris or Warsaw for a move forward. Please work on bringing the EU closer to its citizens, on better regulation and on greater transparency. Build the basis of support for the Constitution, but remember what Theodor Fontane said:  (DE)
 ‘Good digestion is better than a million, but a thick skin is better than good digestion.’  I wish you every success in your Presidency. We will judge you on your achievements at the end of your term. (Applause)

 Mr President, I offer you my warmest congratulations on your election as President of our House. It is the pinnacle of a remarkable parliamentary career, stretching from the first direct elections to the European Parliament. You know that my group opposed the process by which you and the Socialists carved up the House between you during this mandate. Nonetheless, I believe that the majority in my group voted for you, recognising your experience, admiring your political work in this House and convinced of your capacity to be an objective and fair President. In the five years that I have had the honour to lead my group, I have appreciated the cooperative relations that we have enjoyed. I know the same can be said for my predecessor, Pat Cox, who sends through me his warmest regards to you on this day. But as you know, in politics a halo is only 12 inches from being a noose and our reputations depend on our ability to meet ever-new challenges. I hope you will listen to the swelling chorus in this House in favour of reform. From having been ahead of our citizens in advancing the cause of European integration, our Member State leaders are now in danger of lagging behind. The opportunity falls on this House to show a lead in building the European Union we need in order to meet the challenges we face. That will require a house designed and organised so as to be capable of meeting that challenge. I hope that we can work together to create that House with you during your term of office as President, for which I wish you every success. (Applause)

 Mr President, I have to be honest: you were not my group’s candidate in 2004. We had proposed Bronisław Geremek, one of the fathers and architects of today’s Europe of 27 Member States and a symbol of Europe’s reunification. But you have been fair and gentlemanly in your chairmanship of this House: you have treated its Members with courtesy and its business with patience and serenity. As a newcomer to this Parliament, it is not easy to be asked to lead it, and you rose to the challenge. Given the words of Mr Schulz, I wonder whether he fears for his own position should you return to his benches! (Laughter)
 Mr President, particularly I appreciate your commitment to engaging with our citizens. You have invited many of us to join you in your work as an active European in your home country. You have also shown commendable commitment and almost endless energy in promoting the European Union across the continent, and your mission in particular to Europe’s young people has marked your work. However, it has not been limited to the European Union: you have been an active President of this House beyond our shores in your promotion of the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, in your facilitation of the establishment of a Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly and beyond. Nonetheless, I suspect that your greatest success during your presidency has been overseeing the successful integration of Bulgarian and Romanian Observers into this House. The presence today of new Members signals the completion of the fifth enlargement of our Union. The sight here today of two new Commissioners, Leonard Orban and Meglena Kuneva – at work since 1 January – warms our hearts, and the presence in the Council of Ministers of two new countries strengthens our Union as it prepares for an important birthday. Mr President, your predecessor, Pat Cox, put much effort into modernising our House. While recognising the reforms you have promoted, my group would have liked to have seen more reforms in the working of this House. We know that you tried, only to find yourself bound, like Gulliver, at every turn by the bureaucracies of two political groups. Their presence – the stubborn presence of the centuries – hangs heavy on our work. Why should the European Parliament not meet formally every week to receive a report from the Commission? Why should every Member not have a screen on their desks to bring us into the 21st century? Why should our democracy be governed by rules laid down by a 19th century Belgian mathematician called D’Hondt? These rules produce a result that is worked out on a calculator rather than a ballot paper, influenced more by the size and influence of nations than the European commitment and competence of the candidates. It is something we must review if we are to reassert our democratic credibility in this, the 50th year since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, for if we fail to keep up with the times, public disillusion will grow. The appeal of the abhorrent forces of knee-jerk nationalism on the far right may widen. Therefore, I trust, Mr President, that your successors will engage with all Members of this House in a debate about the organisation of Parliament’s affairs in order to preserve and develop the values which you have upheld so courageously in your term as President. In closing, let me congratulate Mr Daul on his maiden speech as leader of his group. We will no doubt hear far more from him in the years to come. (Applause)

 Mr President, the Monty Python team once very uncharitably described Finland as a poor second to Belgium when going abroad. Prime Minister, you and your government have shown that Finland is a poor second to none when it comes to running a European Union Presidency. Thank you for your work in bringing Europe closer to its citizens. Following on from the comitology agreement with the Austrians, you have opened legislation to public scrutiny. I believe that 86% of legislative decisions under your Presidency have been taken in public: a total of 90 decisions compared with only 17 last year. That is a great step forward and I hope that the German Presidency will take it further by getting agreement among Member States to publish the correlation tables so that we can see how Member States put into national law decisions taken at European level and make a fair comparison. Prime Minister, you also have to your credit an agreement on REACH, an agreement on the Services Directive, on which thankfully – whatever Mr Schulz says – we defeated all the Socialist rapporteur’s amendments, an agreement on next year’s budget and an agreement to bring Bulgaria and Romania into our Union. Liberals and Democrats also salute your efforts to try to get agreement on the footbridge Article 42 clause and we regret that this was not possible at the Lahti Summit, but we therefore disagree with paragraph 3 of the Presidency Conclusions, which says that the Union is ‘making best use of the possibilities offered by the existing treaties to deliver concrete results’. It is clearly not making best use of the possibilities, as you recognise a few paragraphs later, when we say that responding to the expectations of citizens is difficult with the existing decision-making procedures and that the framework needs to be strengthened. I hope the German Presidency will get agreement on Article 42. We cannot wait for a new Treaty and our message to Chancellor Merkel must be: Europa muss handlungsfähig sein
. Justice and home affairs is just one example of where such progress is needed. We have talked a lot about migratory flows. Hitherto, too much of the focus has been on security and too little on the economic or humanitarian aspects of these flows. We therefore welcome the recognition in the Presidency Conclusions of the wider aspects, particularly the link between development policy and immigration policy and the need for a legal migration policy opening up the front door a little, in order better to close the back door to illegal migration. More work is needed on illegal migration. It is no good just to have a rapid enhancement of Frontex or permanent coastal patrols. They are only part of the answer. We need to know why people are coming. If you look at the other things you discussed at the summit about Sudan, if the European Union really recognised the new UN doctrine of the duty to protect, fewer people would be moving out of Sudan. Palestine, Lebanon, Afghanistan. Unless we are able to provide security and good government and life chances for people there, they will continue to move. It is no coincidence that some of these countries are the countries of origin of the greatest numbers heading towards our shores. Perhaps the most important outcome of the Summit is paragraph 5: a strong statement on how enlargement has been a success. Clearly if one looks at the Eurobarometer published last week, that message has not got through to our citizens. We need leadership from our Heads of State and Government telling people what a success enlargement has been and how continued enlargement will be needed, once we have our constitutional arrangements in place. If leadership is needed on enlargement it is needed, too, in ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. On reading the sections in the Presidency Conclusions we see too much leadership has been left to the United States. We are particularly concerned about the Eurojust arrangements signed with the USA. Perhaps if we had the passerelle
 in foreign and security policy, we would be able to promote European values further and better. Your Presidency has, in our view, been a success and we hope the return to the land of Santa Claus will allow you a good rest next week, undisturbed, I hope, by the clatter of reindeer hooves. Mr Poettering has given his final speech to this House. He has been a fair, frank, and I am pleased to say federalist companion. The European Parliament needs an ideological majority rather than a große Koalition
. We were pleased to work with him in an ideological majority for a while. He will find that this (DE)
 empty togetherness is nothing but accompanied loneliness.  Nonetheless, we wish him all the best for the future, whatever he ends up doing. (Laughter and applause)

 Mr President, observers will be delighted to hear that the Presidency-in-Office is cutting down the length of the Council conclusions. I understand that the current draft is about 20 pages, at least in French, compared with the normal 60. They may not be so pleased to hear from Mr Poettering that the European People’s Party is meeting tomorrow to prepare the summit. They are so divided over issues like Turkey that, when they prepare the summit, things never get better! In fact, I understand that the Council Secretariat is preparing a letter saying, ‘please, if things don’t get better soon, we may have to ask you to stop helping us!’ I would like to address three issues that are on the agenda for the summit: enlargement, energy and migration. The Council will discuss enlargement and, no doubt, integration capacity. Perhaps they will find an agreement on where Europe ends, but I suspect that Jean Monnet might have been right when, addressing the predecessor to this assembly, the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1955, he spoke of a ‘broader united Europe whose bounds are set only by those who have not yet joined’. As the Chinese would put it rather more prosaically, ‘the people who decide when the bus is full are those on the outside’. It is important to discuss Turkey and I praise the Commission, and particularly the work of Commissioner Rehn, in taking action and making a firm proposal before there was time for an anarchy of reaction from national capitals; a firm proposal that was supported by the foreign ministers and, I hope, will be taken up by the Council. But let us then recognise that before we talk any more about enlargement, we are going to have to get our own constitutional arrangements sorted out, because the European people will not want us to enlarge further without a clear basis for the further development of our Union. It is not going to do any good to think we can rewrite the Nice Treaty for Croatia. Let us get the Constitution sorted first. On energy, the great worry of my group, President-in-Office, is that the European Union is in danger of being held hostage. Held hostage to producers, whether they be in Russia or in North Africa or in Central Asia – or perhaps even in Latin America – in the case of biofuels. What we urgently need to do in Europe is to cut consumption by motor vehicles and electrical equipment; cut consumption of heating through better design of buildings; cut the consumption of electronic equipment; and increase production of safe, sustainable energy sources – biomass, as proposed by the Commission, and renewables, perhaps through research by moving to a hydrogen economy or looking into nuclear fusion. We need to liberalise markets, because one of the reasons we do not have a proper energy policy in Europe is that we do not have a proper liberalisation of the market. I am pleased that even the Social Democrats, meeting in Oporto last week, have finally recognised that competition is going to be important for future development. On migration, the Commission and the Council are concentrating too much on the security aspects, not enough on the economic or humanitarian aspects. You cannot talk of ‘effective management’ of migration, of ‘reinforcing’ FRONTEX and so on, without recognising the human tragedy unfolding on our southern shores because people know they will find jobs here in Europe. The President said this was a long-term challenge – yes, but for five years the Council has done nothing about it, and we must make progress. Finally, if the Council does come to discuss the site for Galileo – I understand that Prague, Valetta and Ljubljana all want it – why do they not follow the example of this wonderful institution and have a three-site operation? At least those looking at the site for Galileo would be able to say eppur si muove
!

 Mr President, the imminence of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is underlined by today’s vote on the nominees for the posts of two Commissioners and two Members of the Court of Auditors. Both Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban were deeply involved in the negotiations for their respective countries’ membership. Each was dealt a tough hand of cards, especially if you think of the distance that each country has travelled on its road to membership. It proved tougher than expected and needed two years more than other countries emerging from the former Europe. We must learn now to adapt our Union to a wider membership – a fuller house – with inevitable family disputes. All must learn to give a bit if they are to take. Whether we yet have a full house, of course, is still a matter for debate and maybe Mr Brok would enlighten us towards the end of this week? It is fitting that those who bore the burden of accession negotiations bear some of the fruit of their labours. Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban have a great deal to contribute to Europe. The depth of knowledge they have gleaned from the talks will stand them in good stead for their collegial decision-making on the upper floors of the Berlaymont. Whether they choose to play the Queen of Hearts or the Ace of Spades in President Barroso’s House of Cards is up to them, but I remain convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will be an asset to the Union, and not a burden as some would have us believe. I know that some in this House are thinking of voting against one of the nominees for the Court of Auditors. If we are serious about bringing two countries into the Union, let us be serious about bringing them in properly and not play games with the nominees. Let me offer a word of advice to President Barroso as he chews on how to use the talents of his two latest recruits: there are not enough jobs for 27 Commissioners. That is why we supported the Constitution’s provisions to slim the College down. Please ensure that Members of the Commission act in the Community interest and not as representatives of their home states; define their jobs clearly, more clearly than you have done in your letter to President Borrell, allegedly ‘clarifying’ the role of intercultural dialogue. It has left many of us with more questions than answers. However, we wish you success. We wish the two new Commissioners success and we expect that you will do the job we need to advance the cause of Europe. (Applause)

 Mr President, as Commissioner Wallström’s research – presented to one of our committees last week – has revealed, there is at least as much a communication crisis in the European Union as a constitutional crisis. We risk slowly but inexorably losing the confidence and trust of our citizens by our collective failure to respond to their concerns and our inability to frame a coherent and acceptable response. Those concerns are many and varied, but to my mind they hinge around responses to the challenges of the world in which we live. We witness rapid world population growth, even though it is declining here, and failure to share equitably the fruits of our endeavours or the benefits of modernity. As a result, many vote with their feet. We are creating a global economy without forging a comparable global social contract. We face a major challenge, as the Prime Minister mentioned, from internationally organised crime, with some criminal gangs now more powerful than some national governments. Yet the Union seems more geared to solving yesterday’s problems than today’s or tomorrow’s. The tools to solve these problems are at our disposal in a common foreign and security policy and a justice and home affairs policy, but they lie unemployed. The irony is that the Constitution as it emerged from the Convention probably met most critics’ concerns. Unfortunately, Europe’s political class failed to explain this, for which we all share responsibility. We left the field open to the Constitution’s detractors and there is little sign yet that France will have a more serene or informed debate on its place in Europe in the run-up to next May’s elections, or that the Netherlands, emerging from elections last week, has really made up its mind. It would be too easy to conclude that the victory for the anti-European parties is confirmation that we got it wrong, but we need the Prime Ministers of those two countries to come here to explain to us how they see the way forward. In Poland there is denial, and from across the English Channel an eerie silence reflecting relief and embarrassment in near equal measure. I hope the Germans can relaunch the debate. I applaud Angela Merkel’s determination to do this, but I suspect she will find it extremely difficult within the period of the German Presidency. This is where Ireland can play such an important part, Prime Minister, not only because of the role you played in the Convention, or your experience of adverse referendum, but because of Ireland’s role in looking for what you called a return to the balance and the substance of the constitutional treaty, and in working together with Portugal and Slovenia. Go out and build a coalition of smaller countries that know how important it is to respond to the challenges of globalisation. Go out and build a coalition of the political forces which, in response to the challenges of globalisation, recognise that we need to keep the drawbridge down rather than pull it up. We have to show our citizens that the European Union can work on energy policy, on issues like mobile phone roaming charges, and in particular on justice and home affairs. We can do that with the existing Treaties by use of the passerelle
 clause. By any objective standards our Union is a great success. Therefore, think less about changes to the Constitution and more about building the collective courage to go out and persuade people why it is necessary.

 Mr President, I have lost count of the number of times we have debated the Middle East in recent months, but I do know that, since our debate in September, 150 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, 70 in the last week alone. The atrocity in Beit Hanoun, where 18 Palestinian civilians were killed, is as indefensible as it is inexplicable. In a spiral of violence where there is armed aggression on both sides, it is often hard to tell what is attack and what is retaliation, but there is no doubt in my mind that David Grossman was right when he said last week that the behaviour of Israel’s leaders is the conduct of scoundrels. My colleague Mr Davies was recently in Gaza. He reports as others do that Gaza has become a prison, with daily reports of extrajudicial executions, of lives disrupted and rendered miserable, disproportionate retaliation – especially since Operation Summer Rains, the Qassam rockets have killed 14 civilians over two years. The IDF response has killed 126 people in the last month, of whom 63 were not involved in fighting. The time is over. We cannot wait any longer. The international community cannot continue to condemn while waiting to solve the situation. It is a disastrous strategy that leaves the stage to others. We must relaunch the talks and the negotiations. We must waste no time in deploying international and military observers in Gaza. We must reinvigorate the commitment of the Quartet, and I hope that the US will reinforce its role by assisting in the negotiations as a test-case of a new multilateralism. Palestinians must understand that the use of terror will never earn them the recognition they seek, and Israelis must understand that they are losing recognition by their incessant flouting of international law and disproportionate military action against civil targets. At Yitzhak Rabin’s memorial service, Mr Grossman spoke of a country hypnotised by insanity, rudeness, violence and racism, of a state squandering its goodwill, squandering its own people, especially its young. The same Israel has recently used army bulldozers to destroy the graves of British soldiers killed in Gaza in 1917 and on 31 October sent F-15 fighter planes to dive at French soldiers serving with the UNIFIL force in Lebanon. How many enemies do the Israelis want? How long do they believe they can sustain themselves in a state of unresolved conflict? It is time for reasonable people on both sides to come together, perhaps to relaunch the Geneva Process, and it is time for the European Union to do what it can to promote, encourage and support that process. (Applause)

 Mr President, the European Union has been referred to as the greatest example of conflict resolution in history. We must be concerned with the remaining conflicts at home, just as we are concerned with conflicts beyond our Union. It is not for us in the European Parliament to intervene directly between the Spanish Government, political parties and the long-running conflict in the Basque country, but nor can we turn a blind eye. We should encourage what may be the best prospect for peace in a generation. I extend my solidarity and sympathy to all those families who have been bereaved of loved ones over the years as a result of the violence. But surely the most appropriate response that we, as democratic politicians, can bring to those countless victims is to ensure that there will be no more victims. It is for that reason that Liberals and Democrats lend their backing to the resolution before the House today. It is neither a time nor a subject for political point-scoring. It is my firm belief that all democratic forces who wish to see a peaceful end to violence and terror in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain where atrocities have been committed should back the endeavours of whichever Spanish government is prepared to work to that end. Earlier this year, this House welcomed the announcement of an ETA ceasefire. It is right that we now build on that and engage a process that entrenches it, without prejudging or commenting on the outcome of any political dialogue or settlement. As with the Northern Ireland peace process, which is not identical but offers some important lessons for conflict resolution, it is occasionally necessary for politicians to take a risk for peace. I recall that our former colleague John Hume and his Unionist counterpart David Trimble were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, following the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. They took a risk for peace. This is not to hand a victory to the terrorists, as some would suggest, but rather to hand them a defeat. For there can be no dialogue among democrats if one of the parties still maintains the intent to kill. We should not imagine that building the house of peace will be easy. There will be setbacks, such as the discovery of a cache of weapons in south-west France. But it is our duty to build the house of peace with the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence. That is why my group appeals to all sides of this House today to set aside party politics and unite for the prospects of peace, as much as we stand together in revulsion at acts of terrorism. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, there is no resolution to discuss today. But then again there were no conclusions to the summit. My point is not that such occasions are not worthwhile: on the contrary, such is the need for greater action at European level that the Union could and should have four formal summits every year, as foreseen in the Treaty of Nice. What was on the menu at Lahti? I refer not, Prime Minister, to the artichoke soup or the grilled goose that you served at supper, proving that you can supplant prosciutto di Parma
, but to the EIT and the European patents, to energy security, to immigration, to relations with Russia – strategic themes which need serious reflection, but also strategic decisions which highlight the need for coherent policymaking. What is the use of a European technology university producing innovative ideas, if as a Union we are not able to agree a quick and easy patent registration system? What is the hope for a collective climate change strategy if we are not prepared together radically to change our patterns of energy consumption and generation? And what are the prospects for a common immigration policy if we fail to devise development and trade policies to bring relief from grinding poverty and misery? Green Papers and action plans galore point the way forward but, like proverbial horses, Member States can be brought to water but not made to drink. That is why Europe is failing and that is why we need more, not less, Europe. My group salutes President Borrell and Prime Minister Vanhanen and the other Prime Ministers who raised the issue of Anna Politkovskaya’s murder. If the invitation to President Putin and the publicity he received leaves many of us feeling distinctly ill at ease, the Finnish Presidency and the Finnish President are not to blame. The mistake was made when President Putin’s country was invited to join the Council of Europe and the G-8, before anchoring the rule of law into its culture. Mr Putin, ‘mafia’ is not a Russian expression, but organizovanniye zhuliki
 is too often our impression of your country. The European Union should sign no partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia until freedom, transparency and the rule of law are established, along with the legal certainty for investors that flows from them. (Applause)
 Graham Watson (ALDE

 Mr President, this is more in the form of a question to you. I am aware that Mr Borrell Fontelles wrote to Mr Barroso and Mr Vanhanen, requesting that they communicate the names and portfolios of the two new Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania to this House by 23 October. I would like to know whether we have heard anything about that and whether we expect the names and portfolios to be communicated to us this week.

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats wish you well for Lahti. A Presidency in the second half of the year is never easy, and informal talks with 25 Heads of Government round a table are difficult to imagine. I bet you cannot even fit them all into one sauna! On your agenda there will be important matters as diverse as energy, innovation and migration, although, as you say, the real story will be entertaining the President of the Russian Federation. We believe that the Member States must stand foursquare behind the Union flag in condemning attacks on freedom and private property in a country where one more candle of independent thought has just been extinguished. Mr Putin has clearly studied Machiavelli’s dictum: ‘Princes who have achieved great things have been those who have given their word lightly, who have known how to trick men with their cunning and who have overcome those abiding by honest principles.’ While President Putin concedes that his country is tarnished by the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, he fails to add that 40 other journalists have been murdered in his country in recent years. (Applause)
 Liberals and Democrats pay tribute to Anna Politkovskaya. Among her criticisms of the state of freedom and democracy in Russia, she wrote, in a book called Putin’s Russia: Life in a failing democracy
, ‘Yes, stability has come to Russia. It is a monstrous stability under which nobody seeks justice in law courts, which flaunt their subservience and partisanship, nobody in his or her right mind seeks protection from the institutions entrusted with maintaining law and order because they are totally corrupt. Lynch law is the order of the day. The President himself,’ she continues, ‘has set an example by wrecking our major oil company, YUKOS, after having jailed its chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin considered Khodorkovsky to have slighted him personally, so he retaliated.’ Madam President-in-Office, Russia needs the European Union just as much as the European Union needs Russia. They need our market for oil and gas. We are their biggest customer. So let our Heads of State and Government talk to Mr Putin about oil and gas, but do not have them mince their words about an increasingly dictatorial regime. Let them also prepare for life without dependency on Russia through joined-up thinking on energy and the environment. In a week in which Al Gore has promoted his film on the ‘inconvenient truth’ of climate change, our energy policy must in any case reflect an urgent need for a change of direction. Lahti is a follow-up to Hampton Court a year ago, where leaders approved plans to create a European energy market, raise competitiveness and educational levels and tackle the growing pressure of migration. In the past 12 months, the urgency for action in all those areas has increased. The Commission has rightly identified the needs, but Member States continue to deny the means. The Commission proposes a genuine internal market in energy, unbundling networks as we did with telecoms, creating an observatory to monitor stocks, developing a more sustainable energy mix, making energy savings. We welcome these proposals, but we need the Council to get on with them. Mr Barroso wants a European institute for technology. Get on with it, if you can raise the money! Migration is presented, on the one hand, with data showing we need to encourage migration of labour and skills, and, on the other, with media headlines stoking populist fears of uninvited guest workers taking away jobs and benefits. To succeed the Council must act effectively, for which it needs the provisions of the Article 43 ‘bridging clause’. I hope the Finnish Presidency will continue to press for this. We support the Finnish Presidency and its modest and pragmatic approach to EU business. However, Madam President-in-Office, we fear you are being eclipsed already by the forthcoming German Presidency. Issues are being postponed; foreign leaders are courting Mrs Merkel. The German Foreign Ministry is taking the lead. Let us not raise excessively high expectations of what Germany can deliver, nor lower our expectations of what the Finnish Presidency can achieve. The Presidency needs to show that, in the words of the Monty Python song, ‘Finland has it all’!

 Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Cavada for his oral question, the opportunity for this debate, and the excellent work that he and his colleagues do in their committee. I had the honour to chair that committee at the time of the Council meeting in 1999 in Tampere. I have observed the process from Tampere to Tampere. It has been seven lean years. Rather like a critic once said of Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot
: ‘It is a two-act play in which nothing happens, twice.’ I salute the efforts of Commissioner Frattini and of the Finnish Presidency in trying to coax and cajole the Member States forward. Mr Rajamäki spoke of breathing new life into the spirit of Tampere. It is desperately needed. But the fact is that the country I know best threw a spanner into the works when it insisted on having three pillars. Other countries are now blocking the process of repair. Unless we are able to bring in the footbridge – the ‘passerelle
 clause’ – we will never have a credible policy in justice and home affairs. We will continue with a policy like a push-bike when what we need is a Ducati. Member States sit there in their medieval fastnesses with the drawbridges firmly up. In the name of national sovereignty they are enhancing global anarchy. Our citizens demand better. In the early period of building the European Union, political leaders were ahead of public opinion. They saw leadership as painting a vision of the Europe they wanted and leading people towards it. That can be a dangerous strategy, but far less dangerous than being in the position – as you pointed out, Commissioner – of being behind public opinion. Our citizens are asking: why is there no immigration policy to prevent the human tragedy we see on our southern shores? Why are we not sharing criminal intelligence in the fight against terrorism or the fight against drugs? Why is there no access to justice for victims of cross-border crime or cross-border marital breakdown? When ministers meet, as Abba Eban once said in a different context, they ‘never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity’. We want to see more emphasis on European values. We may have no constitution, but we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Mr Rajamäki, you said that human rights are at the top of the Council’s concerns and fully taken into account. Are you sure? What about the CIA secret prisons saga, where this House was right to set up a committee on rendition to see whether we need to use Article 7? What about the PNR issue, where the 2007 agreement to replace the sticking-plaster solution you have devised this month must be in tandem with the framework decision on the protection of personal data? And what about minimum procedural guarantees for suspects in criminal proceedings: why is that issue still at the bottom of the in-tray? Of course there is some progress. But too often the Union looks like the mime artist Marcel Marceau; he appears to be climbing a wall but actually he is going nowhere. I want Mr Frattini and the Presidency to take to the Council on 6 October the message that Europe demands better. (Applause)

 Mr President, there is a Romanian proverb: Unde-s doi puterea creste
. It means where there are two or more, we are stronger. Well, there are two: Bulgaria and Romania recognise that they will be stronger in the European Union and the European Union will be stronger with Romania and Bulgaria. Size matters. With the supranational challenges we face in today’s world, the more countries that share our values and practise good government and democracy within our Union, the more able we will be to promote those values beyond it. So I salute the people of Romania and Bulgaria. I salute their governments, in which Liberals and Democrats are proud to play an important role. I salute, in particular, Meglena Kuneva and Anca Boagiu, who have conducted the detailed negotiations on behalf of their countries like a pair of swans, apparently gliding serenely across the surface of the water but with their feet paddling away ten to the dozen underneath. I express my thanks to the European Commission, and in particular to Commissioner Rehn, for a difficult task imaginatively tackled and accomplished appropriately under a Finnish Presidency. We all recognise that there is unfinished business. The European Union is a moving target with the acquis communautaire
 constantly evolving. Bulgaria and Romania are developing themselves. We know that democracies are sometimes run by crisis management: often problems are often not solved until they have to be solved. We acknowledge that there is only a certain elasticity in the management of public affairs. Moreover, we recognise that there is a need, as in previous enlargements, for transition periods and safeguard clauses. I urge the governments and people of both countries to continue their reforms, but to those who doubt their readiness I ask, would they be better off and would we be better off with them outside? Should we say ‘no’ or ‘not yet’? As the American commentator Mencken once said, that ‘For every complex problem there is an answer which is clear, simple and wrong.’ Leaving them outside the Union would be the wrong answer. I am pleased, however, that the Commission draws attention in its report to the need for greater efforts in the fight against crime and the need for more serious efforts in improving the situation of the Roma people in both the countries joining us. The rule of law and social inclusion are fundaments of our Union. More action needs to be taken by the governments of both countries and the Commission needs to monitor that action on our behalf. What matters to the health of a society is less what it possesses than the direction in which its face is set. It seems to me that the direction of both countries is the right one. To quote from the hymn to St Cyril and St Methodius: ‘March ahead, oh revived people, to your future march ahead, forge your destiny of glory ...’. Forge it with us. There is work to be done in Romania and Bulgaria to make the European Union a reality. We build the European Union together. It will never be built purely from the top down. It must be built from the ground up. That was perhaps summed up by the Romanian writer Adrian Marino, when he wrote: ‘Sa aducem Europa, din nou, la noi acasă’
 – ‘We must bring Europe into our homes’. But there is work to be done in the European Union, too, to convince our citizens that the cost they are paying for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is not a net negative. To explain to them, as the Špidla report showed us, that those countries which welcome new countries as partners gain economic benefits. To point out to them that unless we let low-cost labour come to where the investment is, then the investment will go to where the low-cost labour is. It is a win-win calculation in bringing new countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into the Union. We will all be winners. There are some who ask whether this will be the last enlargement. I believe that our Member States will be obliged to sort out Europe’s constitutional challenges before new countries are taken in. I hope that is what the Commission President meant when he said that this might be the last enlargement. We owe our citizens and the citizens of these two future Member States the duty of sorting our Europe’s constitution before we take in further countries. In conclusion, let us welcome Romania and Bulgaria today, not in a spirit of triumph but in a spirit of satisfaction with work well accomplished. (Applause)

 Mr President, this summer’s conflict has claimed the lives of over 1000 people, the vast majority of whom were innocent civilians. It has reduced much of Lebanon to rubble. If the situation teaches us nothing else, it must teach us to look forward, rather than back. We should waste no time in deploying the 7000 troops that the Union has pledged to UNIFIL to stabilise the situation in southern Lebanon, to cut off the flow of arms and to support the humanitarian effort. We must, however, clarify UNIFIL’s mandate to turn the UN resolutions into reality on the ground. And of course we must go further. We must speak with one voice. We must, in the short term, demand the immediate lifting of Israel’s air and sea blockade of Lebanon. We must demand the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and we must help to establish an effective Palestinian Government. In the medium term, while condemning terrorist acts we must bring Hizbollah and Hamas in from the cold and engage them in a dialogue for the establishment of a democratic framework. We must set up an independent inquiry into the civilian deaths caused by all sides in the recent conflict and, as Kofi Annan has pointed out, it will not be through the barrel of a gun, but thanks to dialogue and compromise that Hizbollah will put down their weapons and negotiate a long-term solution. We have long-term tasks too. If we are to raise a new generation that is not steeped in fear and intolerance, we must build institutions that will ensure peace in the long term. When he was President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi talked about setting up a Euro-Arab development bank, jointly financed and managed by both sides. We must look, too, at a security organisation along the lines of Mr Fogh Rasmussen’s proposed conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, which Mr Schulz has quoted. We must look at how we can tie in, with a proper immigration policy, all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin. And we must oversee all of this through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in which you, Mr President, have invested so much political – and no little financial – capital. Let us learn from Einstein when he told us that peace cannot be kept by force, only achieved through understanding. Mr Tuomioja, you spoke about the European Union’s remarkable achievement and its major success. I commend the work you have done, but let us not exaggerate. It is a crisis that has driven the European Union to the position it is in, though something Michel Barnier has called the reflexe Européen
. The Union does not have the European constitution that it needs and which would have equipped it far better to deal with this situation. We are deploying European forces but this is not an EU force, even if – thank heavens – it is a coalition of the coherent. In terms of democratic decision-making we are running on a wing and a prayer. After your meeting in Lappeenranta on 25 August, Mr Solana said that this was the most important decision taken by the EU for many years. If that is so, then why is Mr Solana not here, telling us about it and telling us about the conditions surrounding this conflict? He has a mandate, but of what kind? (Applause)
 When we asked we were told that the rules of engagement for the forces were: ‘a matter strictly between the United Nations and the troop contributors’. We were told, therefore, that this was not a European matter. It is absurd that Mr Solana is not here to talk to us about the rules of engagement for this conflict! The danger is this: the European public at large believe that Europe has responded to the crisis. If things go wrong and we have large numbers of young men coming back home in body bags, people will want to know who in Europe is responsible. Somebody will have to take the political responsibility. (Applause)
 Please, President-in-Office of the Council, get Europe’s common foreign and security policy together so that we are not faced with that kind of situation. In conclusion, we should give two cheers for Europe: one for Louis Michel’s rapid action and one for Romano Prodi’s courage in coordinating our efforts to deal with this problem. We should thank the Commission, the Finnish Presidency and Cyprus – a new Member State – for the tremendous help it has given. We should also thank Turkey for having the courage to help us in committing troops. (Applause)
 However, we still run the risk of insistence on national sovereignty resulting in global anarchy. (Applause)

 Mr President, with the Finnish Presidency’s emphasis on productivity, accountability and transparency, ‘Finlandia’ is music to Liberal ears. The programme you have presented today, President-in-Office, reflects both the strong reforming tendencies of your government and the egalitarian and innovative impulses of a nation which repeatedly tops the league tables for education, innovation and development. Liberal values will be on the march with your Presidency. I would like to refer to just a few areas which my group feels to be important. First, the market-driven programme. Priorities like completing the internal market, particularly in services and the energy sector, are key goals for us in the months ahead, as are efforts to deliver a directive on the portability of supplementary pensions and promoting market openings for new technologies. The latter will pay more long-term dividends than any government-funded initiatives on research and development, and provide the growth and jobs and prosperity that our Union desperately needs. As regards Article 42 – justice and home affairs – your Presidency is right to focus on areas where European Union legislation adds value to citizens’ lives, but in the modern world a wanted man can be halfway across Europe before the policeman has his boots on. It beggars belief that the law still has borders, when criminals do not. For too long, key initiatives on police and judicial cooperation have been stalled in the Council, and even those decisions taken lack the democratic scrutiny that protects our human rights and civil liberties, as we have seen with the inadequacies of data protection legislation. President-in-Office, the time has come to heed our call to apply the footbridge clause provided for in Article 42 and to make policy in justice and home affairs democratically. The transparency initiative, which has found one of its key supporters in your Presidency, is one way out of this anti-democratic cul-de-sac. Liberals and Democrats seek your assurance that safeguard clauses will be used sparingly or not at all. But true transparency requires that the transposition, implementation and enforcement of legislation be given much more attention than it has to date. Three years ago, we demanded that Member States draw up concordance tables showing how they transposed EU directives into national law. Let citizens see for themselves which parts of the law come from Brussels and which reflect the hobbyhorses of national governments. Otherwise, poor implementation and gold-plating will continue to fuel the fire of Brussels-bashers. Yet, since your Presidency started three days ago, I see changes are already afoot. The comitology decision, which gives Parliament the right of recall, giving us equal powers to Council to make sure the law is applied, is a very important step. With greater power comes greater responsibility and I hope that our House will bear that in mind when it meets today to discuss much-needed parliamentary reform. President-in-Office, you have a big agenda: the agenda of dealing with Asia and the ASEM Summit; the agenda of dealing with Russia. We wish you success in this and we ask you to think not just of engagement, but of promotion of European values, of human rights and democracy, so essential to the development of our world. We wish you success in finding a way forward to an agreement in the WTO, so valuable to our economy and that of developing countries, and we wish you great success with enlargement, though we know that is also in the hands of another very competent Finn, Commissioner Rehn, who is here with us today. In conclusion, you spoke about public fears of globalisation. These can best be overcome by developing a European consciousness. As Lönnrot did for Finland in the Kalevala, we need to draw on aspects of our common history to create a common consciousness. I wish you the wisdom of Väinämöinen. I hope that for the people’s lasting pleasure you compose mighty songs for Europe’s children.  (FI) 
For his people’s lasting pleasure, mighty songs for Suomi’s children. (Applause)

Mr President, the success of this week’s Summit rests, first and foremost, on delivering on one concept: democratisation. Democracy, transparency and accountability must be the building blocks that shape the future of our Union. Without a clear commitment to all three, we will be left with the piecemeal solutions that have stalled reform efforts hitherto and reinforced public distrust in the Union. Europe will be built with the support of the citizens or not at all. Addressing the democratic deficit means an end to the rubber-stamping of regulations behind closed doors. That is why my group congratulates the Austrian Presidency on building on commitments to make transparency the rule rather than the exception in EU policy-making and welcomes the willingness shown by the President of the Commission to publish the names of those who sit on thousands of European Union advisory committees. We still look forward to receiving them, Mr Barroso. We call on the Council to announce that all discussions on lawmaking by codecision will be open to public view. We know – as the journalist Meg Greenfield wrote – that everybody is for democracy in principle, but it is only in practice that it gives rise to stiff objections. We note that, whatever they say in public, those two old secret plotters, Britain and France – the two countries that nurtured democracy at national level and yet with her offspring now suffer amnesia – are still resisting openness in the Council. It is up to the other countries to pull them kicking and screaming into the 21st century. In the short term, the Council must put its faith in Parliament and allow us greater legislative scrutiny. Key initiatives, particularly in justice and home affairs, are often hampered by the absence of qualified majority voting and they end in stalemate. The time has come to apply the passerelle
 clause of Article 42 and shift policies from the third to the first pillar, as proposed by the Commission in its Communication of 10 May, for our reputation – indeed our influence – rests on upholding values like democracy, liberty and respect for human rights. Data protection in the third pillar is necessary to ensure protection of personal data. Likewise, minimum procedural guarantees for the European Arrest Warrant – which I had the honour to pilot through this House – have been held up in the Council since 2001. We want to see progress on all of those issues in order to make the European Union more democratic and more effective. Europe demands no less than an unequivocal drive to democratise decision-making. In the long term, only a constitutional treaty – as practical as it is ideological – can provide the institutional framework to democratise Europe. But it is also time to recognise that the sixteenth and final Member State likely to ratify the Constitution in its current form is Finland. We must recognise that France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will never ratify the 2004 text. Denmark, Ireland and Sweden cannot ratify in current circumstances. The Czech Republic and Poland choose not to ratify, and Portugal will find it almost impossible, while committed to a referendum. So there are two options: renegotiation or oblivion. The sooner we take steps to make structural and substantive improvements to that text and address public concern, the better. President Barroso, I welcome the vision and determination you are showing today. But I want to hear you say that louder and more often to the Member States. You are right – they are all shareholders in the enterprise, but they have been gripped by a fad for short-termism, and anyway the markets are falling. We need to hammer home to the Member States just how much they need the European Union. My group thanks the Austrian Presidency for its good work thus far. We wish you success with other important items on your agenda: migration and other aspects of the Hague Programme; social and economic policy; the fundamental rights agency that we so badly need. Make sure too that our Foreign Ministers have aid to Palestine and CIA renditions on their agenda. The fine wines that you served them at Klosterneuburg were a good aperitif. They now need to sit down to the meat.

 Mr President, when President Bush comes to Europe on 21 June for the EU-US Summit, I urge you to do all you can to ensure that Guantánamo is top of the agenda. After four years of incarceration in a legal limbo, three men detained there took their own lives over the weekend. The US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for public diplomacy
 described these suicides crassly and disrespectfully as a ‘good public relations move’. The European Union, the United Nations, human rights groups around the world, have demanded that Guantánamo be closed. From President Bush we need to know how and when. The Supreme Court in the United States will rule at the end of the month on whether military commissions are a legal way to try prisoners. I urge that everything the Union can do to bring pressure on President Bush be done to ensure that the camp is closed, so that people can be given proper trials if there are legitimate charges against them. (Applause)

 Mr President, it is hard to respond in just four minutes to such a tour de force about the future of Europe. My group welcomes the presence here of Mr Verhofstadt, both as a prime minister and as one of the major architects of European reform. As you recognised, Prime Minister, in the Laeken Declaration in 2001, the European Union has been talking more to itself than to its citizens. Yet five years after your Presidency, the task of reconnecting Europe with its citizens still shows too little evidence of progress. Indeed, just yesterday a survey showed that 82% – more than four in five – of our fellow citizens feel that government at European level fails to communicate with them. Despite the year-long period of reflection – and eight months into the Commission’s much vaunted plans – little has been broadcast beyond the bastions of the Berlaymont. However, the same survey might hold the seeds of hope, for though Europe may not be brilliant at communicating what it does, that survey shows that our citizens still trust the European institutions to do it. In fact, more of them trust the European institutions than their own national governments. So here is Europe’s mandate from the people: a mandate to deliver the reforms needed to meet challenges like energy security, migration, climate change and organised crime, which individual Member States struggle to deal with under the current set-up. Greater coordination of economic policies, as you recommended, Mr Verhofstadt, would certainly help, as would greater defence coordination. Mr Barroso has pointed to the need for practical achievements to reinforce our links with citizens and rally them to our cause. But this ‘Europe of Projects’ can never get off the ground until Member State governments explain to their people what they are doing together in Brussels and why, and until we give the Union the money and the legal powers to push through initiatives like the common energy policy, which faces an uphill struggle against blocking forces in the Council, as too do many other initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs, for example, where the absence of qualified majority voting so often results in stalemate. Quibbling over the passerelle
 clause in the Treaty will resolve little, and change rests, in any case, on the same unanimity which has led to inaction up to now. As you said, Prime Minister, it is the Constitution – as practical as it is ideological – that can best put the institutional building blocks in place to move Europe forward. It is all very well for Mr Schulz to rail against it, but it was his Socialists in France who helped to kill the Constitution in that referendum. (Mixed reactions)
 We need to make our period of reflection a period of analysis, producing proposals on how to proceed. This month’s Interparliamentary Conference on the Future of Europe kick-started the process. Today’s sitting is the logical extension, and let us hear more debates with national leaders. On Europe Day, Estonia became the fifteenth state to ratify the Constitution and Finland will soon follow. To me, that Treaty looks far from dead, and with the political courage of leaders like Guy Verhofstadt, Angela Merkel and Romano Prodi – leaders committed to Europe – then Europe’s future is surely brighter. As the Prime Minister told us, we have a lot of work to do. However, we have the people of Europe behind us in our task, because they recognise, however much some of our national leaders like to deny it, that the big problems we face, the major challenges of globalisation – population growth and migration, climate change, internationally organised crime – cannot be dealt with by nation states built on the 18th-century concept of military industrial power; they require us to overcome our tribal and our religious hatreds and to work together for the future of all our citizens on a planet which we share with many
 others. (Applause from the right and the centre)

. – Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Rehn for his balanced and thorough assessment and his competent handling of this dossier. I also commend Anca Boagiu and Meglena Kuneva and their predecessors as Ministers for EU Integration for their unstinting hard work. The author Mark Twain observed, ‘We can change the world or ourselves, but the latter is more difficult’. Tearing down the Berlin Wall was the easy part. Building a new democratic culture takes much longer. But the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence are working. The decision to proceed in 2007, with appropriate provisos, is the right one. The Commission should not, in my group’s view, revisit its decision in the autumn, except in the gravest of circumstances. We are concerned that Romania and Bulgaria should be judged no more or less harshly than previous newcomers. Our monitoring must be in line with current treaty provisions and legislation in force. We therefore take very seriously the Commission’s expression of serious concern about continuing corruption and failure of the rule of law – areas which need urgent further action. Ill treatment of Romany people, too, continues to offend, which is why the Decade of Roma Inclusion launched by six heads of state and government is so important. In many other areas the Commission identifies failings. These must be put right without delay. But accession cannot be an examination in which candidates fail. For failure would be at least as much a failure of the Union as of the candidate states. What is most important to the health of a society is the direction in which its face is set. Bulgaria and Romania are looking and moving in the right direction. Can that be said of all current Member States? Imagine, colleagues, that last autumn Romania’s Interior Minister had proposed detention of suspects for three months without charge or that the Bulgarian Prime Minister had used the secret services to spy on his colleagues. There would have been outrage. My group has always been wary of those who would pander to the fashionable anxiety about enlargement, making strangers of peoples who will soon be fellow citizens. I was delighted, therefore, to hear that Mr Poettering has defied some in his own party and thrown his weight firmly behind future enlargement. It gives added salience to his group’s decision to meet last week in a city called Split. I appeal to the faint hearts on the right to look at what has been achieved. Has not enlargement been the European Union’s greatest success story, its crown jewels? Commissioner Spidla’s report on transitional arrangements shows that enlargement has brought more jobs and higher economic growth, particularly in those countries that gave open access to their labour markets. But far beyond economic considerations, welcoming new Members has enriched the culture of our Union. Bulgaria and Romania will be treasured assets, if only we give them half a chance. It seems that many of their people believe it is all a matter for government. On the contrary, winning the war against crime and corruption is a matter for each and every citizen. So I urge all Bulgarians and Romanians to work together with government to ensure the best possible outcome and avoid any delay to entry, not least because reform demanded to join the Union is the means to raise standards of living, quality of life, and security at home. I urge all colleagues in this House to show solidarity and demonstrate to the Bulgarians and the Romanians that they do not walk alone. (Applause)

 Mr President, first I should like to add the support of my group for the statements made by Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering in favour of the Austrian Presidency looking again at its availability. The Conference of Presidents last week agreed on only two subjects for debate in our regular ‘urgencies’ slot on Thursday; normally we debate three. My group put forward a proposal to the Conference of Presidents that we debate the issue of Taiwan’s membership of the World Health Organisation. That proposal fell because it was not supported by either of the two major groups – the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group. Health is widely considered these days to be a human right. It is an issue that needs our discussion and therefore my group wishes to propose to this House that we use the third slot available on Thursday afternoon for consideration of the issue of Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organisation.
 Graham Watson (ALDE
). – 
 Mr President, there seem to be many different recollections but it is certainly my recollection that we agreed in the Conference of Presidents that there would not be a resolution. However, I rise to ask you to put an end to this and allow us to get on with our business this afternoon, either by requesting a vote in the House to proceed with the agenda as proposed, or by simply going ahead.
