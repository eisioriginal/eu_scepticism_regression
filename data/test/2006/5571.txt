 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of last year there were some remarkable headlines proclaiming ‘the world is rearming’, ‘trade in weapons is booming’, ‘defence equipment industry – expensive through lack of competition’ and other cases of corruption in Germany as well as in other countries of the European Union. We Social Democrats are absolutely clear in our opposition to this kind of arms race, this increase in weaponry, and also the laissez-faire
 attitude towards corruption. We are in agreement with our national colleagues on this issue. The aims of this legislative package, with these two directives on transfer and procurement that we are discussing here today, will ensure that it is not just a matter of competitiveness, but also of putting a stop to the wasting of taxpayers’ money on the production of defence equipment and of preventing corruption. These are good enough reasons alone for the Social Democrats to accept the result. There will be a European legal framework for awarding contracts for goods and services in the area of defence and security, there will be more cooperation between the Member States, in other words no unnecessary overlaps and no deceiving of Member States by the arms companies, and there will be more competition overall and fewer exceptions under Article 296. For us Members – for all groups, I believe – it was important for us to have introduced the Remedies Directive, in other words the directive prepared by Mr Fruteau. For the Council, it was not at all so clear cut. For us it was important for there to be sanctions in the event of corruption, even down to exclusion from contracts. I think that is something new for this industry, which has been spoilt up to now. However, it was also important to us that the results be viable for all 27 Member States. Even if only six or seven Member States have their own production and a few less get involved in trade, it is important to have 27 States behind us. We have succeeded in that. I am not sure whether everything will work the way we imagine it will and therefore we have incorporated the fact that Parliament wishes to continue to have a certain amount of control. We want to be informed, not just automatically by the Commission, but we want to be informed of the results and about the transposition of this package of directives. In future, when we will have an even stronger European internal market and will gain European powers, as Mr Sarkozy has of course planned, then the European Parliament as an elected institution in Europe must be involved in genuine control, a control that we have in the national parliaments, but do not yet have in the European Parliament. This, however, is a task for the future. In Germany, for example, we have got our fingers burnt with the production of defence equipment and increased prices. We have the Eurofighter – an excessively expensive, if not the 
most expensive, project – and I am sure that every Member State has similar experiences. Finally, I do not wish to express my thanks. The cooperation was quite constructive and the results are, above all, significant. However, I would like to say quite openly that the parliamentary procedure was intolerable. Reaching compromises with the Council and the Commission at first reading simply should not be the work of this House. For this reason, this procedure must only be an absolute exception in future. It was not, in fact, necessary for this legislative package. We should stick to our guns and, immediately after the vote, do away with this type of procedure for non-parliamentary work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to my report, I would like to say once more that we have not conducted ourselves correctly with our decision to debate our own-initiative reports. When I see how the debates proceed – without dialogue, without controversy, without conflicts – I do not feel this to be a proper parliamentary debate and I hope we will put that right quickly after the European elections. Nevertheless, I would like to express my thanks to fellow Members who are not present. We have worked very well together on the production of the report. I would also like to thank the Commission and the committee secretariat. We have made many new joint discoveries during the debate in committee. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has consciously put the debate on implementation relatively early on the agenda because the deadline for implementation by Member States was the middle to the end of 2007, which to date is not much time for a directive involving an enormous and significant element of harmonisation. Nevertheless, some Member States have not undertaken transposal. Certainly, this has to do with the complicated procedure, but it is interesting that three Member States who have not managed it are some of the founding Member States. Therefore, we cannot assume that they are lacking in knowledge of European law. Three Member States have not yet transposed the directive, four have done so deficiently and inadequately and three Member States have received communications from the Commission that could potentially lead to proceedings at the European Court of Justice. There are a large number of cases of deficient transposal. We established during our hearing that two countries have transposed the directive with a great deal of commitment and creativity, namely the United Kingdom and Austria. It is possible, then. The benefits of the internal market should be in the interest of the Member States. The aim of this directive should be to clarify consumer rights and to simplify cross-border trade, to introduce reliable and fair regulations and, of course, to strengthen legal certainty. A very important point for us, as parliamentarians, was the protection of citizens and consumers from fraudulent practices. This applies not only to consumers but also to small enterprises and tradespeople. Our aim, Commissioner, should perhaps be to put these two directives together in the medium term because very many small businesses are confronted by the same irritations in the internal market as consumers. We know of many examples, such as annoying advertising and misleading and aggressive business practices. We all know the address book fraud that is a widespread problem throughout Europe. We know about cheating on the lottery and much more besides. I would also like to thank the Commission for rigorously introducing the new sweep and search system in airlines and ring-tone advertising. We hope that it will continue to work on this. We expect that it will implement stronger networking with national offices and ensure that black lists are not undermined and sanctions are actually a deterrent – a quite significant point for us as parliamentarians. I would like to say, in closing, that successful transposal requires cooperation between the Member States and between national and European parliamentarians and, entirely in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, which has been mentioned here, I would also like to argue in favour of national parliamentarians exercising more control over their national governments. These two Acts would be a good start.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciate Mrs Rühle’s efforts, and I will probably vote in favour tomorrow, but I do still have certain substantive and procedural concerns. The common market in defence-related products and the promotion of competitiveness are not, in my view, an end in themselves. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament do not want a remilitarisation of the European Union: we are trying to achieve something else through this law. We want greater transparency, and that is what we are getting. We want more efficient cooperation between the Member States, which will also result in reducing the costs of national defence budgets. And it should not be underestimated – I am addressing this particularly to one side of the House – that, above all, these binding rules will help to prevent corruption. We all know how prone to corruption this sector can be. Another positive outcome from the negotiations was that the strict export restrictions of some countries, such as Sweden and Germany, have not been eroded. There are still two drops of bitterness, though: my proposal that democratic control should, for the first time, be implemented via parliamentary monitoring was unfortunately rejected in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection; and the second bitter point is that we could not re-submit this proposal, because we had not had a proper parliamentary debate. We are not talking here about plimsolls, but about dangerous, hazardous goods, and I therefore feel that informal trialogues – as they are so innocuously called, whether they relate to the climate-change package or to toys or to other laws – do not belong in a modern parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in Europe have a deep understanding of, a lively interest in and a great affinity for the people of Vietnam. My group still remembers all too well the terrible suffering and devastation caused by the wars and occupations in Vietnam, not only by the United States but also by European countries. Vietnam is now developing in a particularly dynamic and exciting region in South-East Asia. The 10 Member States of ASEAN are not all democracies as we in Europe understand the term, but things are changing. The new ASEAN Charter shows specifically that violations of human rights cannot be ignored, Mr Tannock, and the negotiations leading up to it prove that violations of human rights are very much on the agenda. Now is a particularly good time because the negotiations have been re-opened; the cooperation agreement of 1995 is being renegotiated. It is true that, after China, the European Union is Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner, and it is for precisely that reason that we will be able to make progress. Partnership agreements are certainly not pointless. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament calls on the Commission to work to ensure that the freedom of the press, freedoms for minorities and activists for democracy, freedom of religion and, of course, the freedom of UN observers to operate are guaranteed. Then we will be able to develop an even closer friendship with this beautiful country.

Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, about a year ago, on 14 February, the European Commission proposed this new package of measures for goods with the aim of injecting fresh impetus into trade in the internal market. The fact that we have managed to bring the package to a conclusion today, in little more than a year, is indicative, I believe, of the very fast and efficient work of the team entrusted with its passage through Parliament. No part was played by the Members up there in the back – on the far right, if I may put it that way – and their contribution left me with the impression that they do not know to this day what the package is all about. What struck me during the course of this debate was the huge number of obstacles that still exist in the internal market, given that it was back in 1992 when Jacques Delors introduced the single market. It is astonishing to see the real difficulties that face small and medium-sized enterprises when they try to enter the market in other EU Member States. According to the Commission, this package contains measures that will impact on 22 industries with an aggregate annual output in the region of EUR 1 500 billion. We have managed to ensure that future improvements to the system of market surveillance will be based on uniform criteria, and that is essential. When a market is open, there must also be surveillance mechanisms in place. Dangerous goods can be more easily detected and made safe, and more clearly targeted investigation of fraudulent operations and prosecution of fraudsters can be carried out. As other speakers have said, not only producers but also importers will be held responsible in future. This will not be a dead letter, for there will also be a liability provision with penalties for non-compliance. This system of market surveillance is also a major gain for players who already abide by the rules, because it considerably improves the means of detecting the bad eggs among manufacturers and importers. I was astonished to learn that customs authorities and market-surveillance bodies have hitherto known next to nothing of each other’s activities. This secrecy and the supposed protection of corporate interests will be stopped here and now. In connection with the CE mark, I am pleased that Parliament has gone its own way. We did not accede to the hasty calls from consumer organisations seeking the abolition of the CE mark or to the Commission’s call for unwarranted upgrading. These were not the right paths to choose. I believe we have now opted for the best way ahead. In the face of opposition from some quarters, Parliament also secured the preservation of national safety marks – not only the German one but others too – until such time as we find the ideal alternative. As a Social Democrat I am also proud that one particular principle is enshrined not only in our resolution but also in the Regulation itself. The formula in question was somewhat contentious until the very last minute, but we succeeded in laying down that accreditation bodies must not compete with each other and must keep their public mission sacrosanct, as it were. I believe this was the consensus view too. What was important to all of us was the need for greater transparency. It is astonishing to note how little cooperation still takes place, and I believe this package will pave the way for better cooperation among public authorities too. Let me conclude with a word on the package as a whole. It represents a gain for Europe’s businesses as well as its people. Many things will be easier, many processes will be less bureaucratic – and thus less costly, of course – and yet we are still creating a higher level of safety for consumers. To borrow an expression from the business world, this can rightly be termed a win-win situation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, indeed the whole world, is looking at Burma. Today, for the first time, blood has been shed, as my colleague from the UK has already mentioned, for nothing else can be covered up and that is a new situation in the debate. The Socialist Group is appalled by the brutal methods deployed by the military junta against the peaceful demonstrators. We expect the UN Security Council, which is now meeting in parallel, to take immediate measures and bring its influence to bear, and that means its influence over and with China. The second message to be sent out today must be the European Parliament's solidarity with the people of Burma: our solidarity, support and, yes, our admiration for the courage of its citizens. The Buddhist monks are not a small elite minority. They are part of the citizenry and are supported by thousands of people. Clearly, the demonstrations were triggered by the arbitrary price increases, but violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and specifically of International Labour Organisation standards, torture and forced labour have been practised by the junta for years. In the age of globalisation, isolationism is no longer an option, and that is a good thing. Democratic basic rights and the universal value system apply on the Asian continent as well. We expect the long-planned constitution in Burma to be put on the agenda straight away, and that Burma – like Thailand, interestingly, relatively soon – will hold democratic elections. It is possible to establish and implement democratic regimes in these regions. Besides the UN and Europe, the ASEAN countries must of course also play a more active role, especially since they aspire to be something akin to an EU. The demonstrations in the Philippines today are a positive sign of solidarity in the region. There is no turning back on the road to democracy, even in Burma.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many members of the public might well find today’s debate rather odd: after all, the internal market has been around for more than 15 years and a lot of people have become quite used to it. Yet even after all this time, there remain some astounding shortcomings, due in certain cases to protectionist behaviour by a few Member States. Certain things have also gone wrong over the years. Members of the public – consumers – have less freedom of choice and the market is by no means a level playing field; it might be that for big companies, but for SMEs it most certainly is not. We all share the view — and I hope I speak here not just for Parliament but also for the Commission and the Council – that the internal market is not an end in itself. I should like to quote one of the great founding fathers of the Single Market, Jacques Delors, who talked about three key principles – competition, to stimulate; cooperation, to strengthen; and solidarity, to unite. The last of the three has been somewhat obscured down the years. For us as Social Democrats, solidarity and cohesion in the internal market are very important. My final point is this: an effective market implies effective safeguards and consumer protection. Only by putting these in place can we build the confidence that everyone is reminding us about. Recent years have seen an increase in the number of products that contain hazardous substances or pose a risk: Chinese toys are merely the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of products are the subject of complaints. So that is where our task lies, and your task too Commissioner: we need to use our package of market-control measures to win back people’s trust; we need to take action and not simply leave things as they are.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in thanking our Committee Chairman for an excellent report that is consistent with our previous reports and also incorporates all our suggestions. I am particularly grateful because I see this report as following on from the report on public–private partnerships – an approach that is very appropriate and also helpful. I think the rapporteur makes excellent proposals, which, in principle, bring us closer to the realisation of the internal market. However, the criticism she mentions deserves consideration by us all, including the public. The fact that the main reasons are ‘lack of national legal expertise or human resources and the lack of political will in the Member States’ is indeed an indictment. We expect proper behaviour from our neighbouring countries, from Asia and Africa, yet we are not meeting our own objectives. I do not want to limit my speech here to accusations, but all the judicial proceedings taking place in this connection are annoying, unnecessary and expensive. That is why it is important that we take action in this field and also support the Commission’s activities. I should like to reiterate that it is good that environmental and social criteria are being publicised more widely. It is very surprising that, in Member States, it is SMEs, in particular – the upholders of our economic innovative capacity – who are for the most part unaware of the possibilities, and that the public in our Member States mostly think they need concern themselves with only the cheapest tenderers and not be guided by other criteria. I should like to conclude by expressing my thanks for the constructive cooperation I have received. It was so good that I recommend that all those who have tabled amendments withdraw them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not only a tricky subject but, astonishingly, also an area in which Member States are persistently infringing European law. The Green Paper was discussed in 2004, Parliament tabled a motion for a resolution in 2006, and now we have a new interpretation – yet, in reality, hardly anything has changed. Member States are continuing to do as they please. Has the CFSP failed in this respect? I can see no real improvement since 2004. Member States and members of national parliaments seem to be completely unaware of Article 296 of the EC Treaty – as, indeed, it describes an exceptional situation rather than the rule. In addition, the European Court of Justice has found once again that this is not a case of a general automatic derogation. Yet there is no improvement to be seen, even though – and this, too, may still be worth mentioning – the group concerned consists of just six Member States. There, too, I do not currently see any improvement. To put it clearly, I do not want any increase in the defence budget; above all, my group wants to see savings by means of cooperation and the use of synergies. Parliament has made some recommendations in this regard, for example on the components the new Code of Conduct should have. Perhaps the Commissioner could add something in this regard? We have also requested better cooperation from the Commission – and not only the Commission, but also the European Defence Agency. I cannot see much evidence of this in reality. I should like to reiterate that we have made suggestions on the mechanisms for the competitive award of contracts the Commission still needs to change for us to finally achieve what everyone in this House wants. After all, we agree with the Commission that a genuine European defence market is necessary to reduce military expenditure costs and to make production more efficient in the interests of the taxpayer and the public.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this subject is naturally very seductive for politicians, as it is so broad-based – which is the way the Commission wanted it. Therefore, I should like to confine myself to a few of the most important points on which the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection decided – with relatively little controversy. We believe that a well-functioning internal market creates a favourable environment for innovation. Our understanding of a well-functioning internal market is one that has no unnecessary barriers or detrimental effects on society. We advocate better management of the transfer of academic results, particularly to SMEs, than has previously been the case, since SMEs – as the Commissioner has already said – have been a driver of innovation and creativity. SMEs are also the enterprises who, in Germany and throughout Europe, have been devoting particular attention to training young people. I predict disaster if fewer young people are trained and thus qualified to work on our issues. We believe that better regulation can give rise to unnecessary burdens on SMEs, but that it will raise consumer trust and confidence. We advocate the swifter introduction of European standards and supra-EU international standards, and we believe that sound, flexible rules in the field of public procurement could also help improve the innovation strategy. We believe that the provision of information to SMEs and other institutions must be improved, and – to reiterate – I welcome the fact that the Committee on Regional Development intends to introduce a technology adviser. I should like to conclude by mentioning two more aspects that we consider particularly important: the promotion of innovations with social applications, as we believe this has prospects, and the need for this Commission initiative to also give citizens a better quality of life.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by giving the Commission credit for consulting this House and all the stakeholders at this early stage concerning the new directive, something of which I am sure one could not always be certain. This makes me confident that the new directive is being planned carefully and will incorporate not only the relevant assessments of impact on society, lawmaking, and subsidiarity, but also European citizens’ rights. Rules on health care across borders have become necessary, and many members of the public expect them to be in place – I am referring to workers in our border regions, to migratory workers, to pensioners in south-eastern Europe and Greece, and, indeed, to Europe’s long-distance drivers, about whom I have just been reminded – and not only to all these, but also to all the other workers who were formerly unable to benefit from these things, which were – as has been said a couple of times – reserved to private patients. It is for that reason that I find it all the more absurd that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left in this House want to further entrench the privileges of those with private health insurance. If the opening up of the national systems is done with caution and care, it will be something from which we can all benefit. Constructive competition among service providers, competition between the best methods, the most useful research and the most successful strategies in the health sector – all these things can be useful, subject, of course, to the criteria to which I have already referred and which do not apply in the internal market, namely quality, safety, solidarity and sustainability. I am sure that this House will not fail under any circumstances in allowing those criteria to prevail.

 Mr President, Commissioner, since I cannot say that I completely go along with what has been said by the last two speakers, I am glad to be able to reassure you of our support for your ambitious objectives. Although the mix of different options that you have described sounds very appealing, we doubt that it is efficient in real terms, for you will have to contend not only with the different objections from the Member States, but also with very powerful economic interests, and so we would remind you that your fellow Members of the Commission – men and women like Mrs Kroes, Mr Verheugen, Mr McCreevy, and Mr Kyprianou – first earned the respect of the European public by imposing effective and substantial sanctions in their own areas of responsibility. We would suggest that you do likewise.
 Barbara Weiler (PSE

 rapporteur
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the representatives of the other groups – Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr Lambsdorff, Mrs Rühle – and also to the representatives of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had a hand in the production of this report, for we were able to exchange views in a constructive and fair way, and managed, in any case, to achieve agreement on over 140 amendments in committee, so that there remain only 23 to be considered today or tomorrow, although it has to be said that compromises had to be reached in respect of them too. We have tried to strike a balance between two powerful opposing parties – the business associations and the local government associations – which put forward their no doubt legitimate interests in a forceful manner. What I have to say at the beginning of my speech I wish to address to them. What I want to say to the businessmen is that, despite all that we have heard, I want to make it clear that we in this House take it as self-evident that local authorities should engage in economic activity, and, indeed, that returning certain activities to them is reasonable and legitimate. What I would like to say to the local authorities is that invitations to tender, whether at the national or European level, do not absolutely have to be arbitrary, but offer the transparency that is needed to benefit the public and prevent corruption. I get the impression from the debate that their respective associations did not always see it that way. I have attempted, by means of my report, to strike a balance that would secure more guaranteed competition for the private sector and would give the public sector, in the shape of the local authorities, more scope for inter-municipal cooperation. Tomorrow, then, we will be deciding where this House stands as regards future mandates for action by the Commission, which – or so my group believes – should, wherever possible, be in the form of legislation. What this is about is the legal and political aspects of the way in which our municipalities organise services of general public interest. That they do, of course, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which we here in this House also take very seriously; after all, many Members of this House have strong links with local authorities, having been active in municipal politics before they came here. We are also, though, asked how we, as the convinced Europeans that we are, would shape the internal market, and there is a plethora of rulings from the European Court of Justice and from other courts at the national level. Complaints and Commission proceedings make municipalities and investors nervous about making investments at home and initiating projects, and so it is necessary for the European Union to take action. What, for example, is the substance of European procurement law? What clarifications or additions need to be made to the institutionalised PPPs and in-house transactions? We see ourselves as having the vitally important function of considering how to proceed. My group takes the view that legislation is needed, that it is not enough for the Commission, attempting as it does so to bypass this House, to act by handing down interpretive communications or other instruments of that kind. I therefore once more appeal today to the Members of this House, when they vote by roll-call tomorrow, to cast a vote for this House’s right to govern its own affairs. We want neither a great laborious enterprise, nor an opening-up of the last procurement directive, which was not transposed in all the Member States – it was not, for example, in Germany – but what we want to see is clarifications and additions, and they must not be made without reference to Parliament. I will be quite frank in saying that we have no solution to the problem of inter-communal cooperation, which was – as you will see from the amendments – the most controversial area. The line we take is that it cannot, as a general rule, be excluded from the scope of procurement law, but nor should it be subject to general tender. What that means is that we need an intelligent solution to this bone of contention, for intercommunal cooperation makes sense for the communities from which we come, and will certainly be useful to them in the future. That this House is supportive of this instrument is shown not least by our willingness to use money from the Structural Funds for it; I am sure that it is not common knowledge just how much effort we have put into getting that. Given our sympathy for European local authorities and the expertise of my fellow-Members on the Committees for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am convinced that we will end up with a law that everyone can support and accept, and one that will be proof against rulings from the European Court of Justice.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, far from doing any credit to the principle of better regulation, this directive, in fact, does the opposite. It is you, Commissioner, who must bear responsibility for the annoyance, indeed the indignation of almost all groups in European society, and for what we just heard about from Mrs Roithová – the playing off of Members from the East and West against one another. We are not talking about raising the drawbridge. The internal market is not an end in itself. That is why we needed the three major exceptions: the Posting of Workers Directive, the Temporary Workers Directive, which must remain an exception for as long as the Council keeps the European directive on ice, and in particular the Professional Qualifications Directive, adopted by all of us here in this House. An efficient internal market without barriers and without discrimination, with fair framework conditions, is a win for Europe – for providers, service providers, consumers and employees. But that is certainly not what this directive gives us. I would particularly like to thank the European Trade Union Confederation, which has been working with us to advocate protection, without falling into the trap of national narrow-mindedness. The solution is not to reject, but to reshape.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no question that 18 months is a long time for a debate to go on within the Council. Yet this is no time at all in comparison to the service lives of machinery. Speaking as someone who has worked in the field of mechanical engineering for 20 years, I am of course aware of the significance of this directive, inter alia 
in terms of making legislation more consistent. Although many users were initially sceptical, it is my belief that more or less all doubts have now been dispelled. The first letters have arrived from people expressing their approval, and since our aim is to focus on the user and not to ignore public opinion, this approval is important. This directive is not only important for users, however, but also for millions of consumers, since it contains legal provisions that are of crucial significance for their health and safety. As the Commissioner said, one of the reasons why this revision was necessary was because earlier directives did not go far enough. Further reasons included the need to improve the necessary legal certainty, to define the scope in more detail and to safeguard the free movement of goods at the same time as ensuring a high level of health and safety protection for consumers. This should also be a priority goal for European industrial policy. I should like to thank the Members of this House and, above all, the Commission and the Council for their excellent cooperation. It was nonetheless necessary for the Social Democrats to incorporate a number of key considerations, and indeed this meant that we had more in common with the Council during most of the rounds of discussion. For example, we want the Commission to develop guidelines to help the Member States to increase their capacities. This would enable effective market surveillance with a view to the uniform application of the directive. At the same time, however, the Social Democrats also believed that confidentiality and trade secrets must not have a negative impact on personal health and safety. Another of our goals, and one which we have now achieved, was to lighten the burden on SMEs, without affecting the substance of the Directive or imposing additional costs. A further important aim for us was to ensure that the standards for disabled people using lifts were not compromised as a result of the revision of the Directive. We have achieved all these goals. We were opposed to agricultural and forestry tractors not being included, but we accept the Commissioner’s explanation. We would have preferred him to set a date, and to set a date of 2008, but since we will all still be Members of this Parliament at that point we will be able to ensure that the necessary steps are taken. We do not want to exclude small appliances, Mr Schwab, because it is not just wristwatches that we are talking about, but fire extinguishers and similar small appliances that are relatively dangerous. Nevertheless, I believe that we have achieved a good compromise. The Social Democrats will vote in favour of it, and for once this week I should like to praise the British – and such praise is not something that can be taken for granted – since our cooperation with the British Presidency on this matter has also been excellent.

 This directive does not, as yet, provide a satisfactory solution to a problem that exists with regard to German professional qualifications. Following amendments to German legislation, the directive will mean that the German qualifications of journeyman (‘Geselle
’) and master craftsman (‘Meister
’) will be placed in the same category, even though master craftsmen are required to complete a demanding additional training course that lasts many years. It would still be possible to add the qualification of master craftsman to a higher-ranking category, however, by including it in Annex II of the directive. We have voted in favour of the compromise in the hope that the ‘Committee on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications’, which will be responsible for such matters according to Article 58 of the directive, will comply with this request before the deadline for transposition.
 Barbara Weiler,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this compromise is, in part, the work of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and we will be voting in favour of it tomorrow. This new directive covers employed persons and self-employed professionals in what are termed the regulated professions, that is to say, those in which skills are attested by qualifications, ranging from architects to heating engineers by way of nurses and pharmacists. While incorporating ECJ rulings and making them permanent, it will also simplify matters, and that is precisely what we wanted – a balance between the right to free movement and settlement in Europe on the one hand and secured standards for professional qualifications and in consumers’ interests on the other. As the Commissioner has just said, this directive can be seen as one of the services directives, and it is indeed meant to make the internal market simpler. In terms of European internal market policy, then, it is the positive side of the coin, and my description of it as ‘positive’ is meant by way of comparison with the notorious services directive. For the benefit of those who do not yet believe me, let me quote: ‘Migrant professionals shall be made subject to the same conditions for exercising a profession as the nationals of the host Member State’, or, even more specifically: ‘The qualification requirements of the host country must continue to be met’. That shows how important it is to us that the rules and regulations of the destination country or host country should be taken seriously and should not be allowed to be devalued in other areas. We have achieved a great deal; among other things, we have managed, together with all our fellow Members, to get it stipulated that checks are carried out in the destination country, which may, if necessary, require guarantees, liability insurance, or even further training. The polemics of various newspapers provided for a regrettable interlude and resulted in some people being unsettled. Between first and second readings, there was division within the Council, which – and I stress that I am talking about the Council as a whole rather than about Luxembourg – showed itself somewhat hesitant. It is not true to say that three months of evening classes are enough to equip heating engineers to do the job. Nevertheless, despite the polemics of certain newspapers and certainly of certain trade associations, we have the result we wanted. It is practicable; it has a significant effect on our chances in the internal market and on the public’s opportunities. We should now do everything we can to make good use of them and to enable the members of the public to experience Europe as we always intended it to be.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I was one of the observers who spent Christmas in Kiev, and I am sure I speak for everyone who was there when I say that this political event made it easier for us to spend the festive season in a different way for a change. The elections were perfectly in line with OSCE standards, and the few irregularities, such as the sudden decision by the Constitutional Court, were handled relatively well. What did, of course, help the elections to be properly conducted was the public interest in Europe and throughout the world, but that public interest and that attention must not flag now, for the democratic process is not yet complete. We observers were impressed by the commitment and determination showed by the citizens – as demonstrated by the high turnout – and not just by experts and elites. We saw a vast number of people walking great distances – as they were obliged to – in order to reach the polling stations. What I found impressive and heartening was that the interest and involvement of women in this democratisation process and at the polling stations went without saying. I cannot produce a quotation from the Bible to illustrate that, but these are signs of a society composed of citizens who do not wait for their government’s decisions. I hope that this democratic process will also prove an incentive to Ukraine’s neighbouring states, specifically to Belarus. What is Europe to do now? For a start, the country has been divided and polarised during the election and we must not make these divisions any deeper. Secondly, we must consider what help and what prospects we can give Ukraine. The existing concept of neighbourhood aid will have to be radically rethought if we do not offer the prospect of membership within the next two or three years.

 The German Social Democratic (SPD) delegation has voted in favour of the option of establishing a European private company. We would like to issue the following explanation, however. Worker participation is a cornerstone of a democratic and social Europe. For that reason, the right to information, consultation and worker participation, without restrictions, must take the same form as in the existing rules on the European company (Societas Europae – SE) and the European cooperative society (Societas Cooperativa Europaea – SCE). The version of a European private company now agreed represents an improvement on the Commission’s proposal in this regard – which is the reason we have voted in favour – but fails the objective of adapting to the existing rules. The risk of circumventing workers’ rights to participation has not been completely averted. The process is not yet over. We call upon the Council of Ministers to improve the proposal in the following ways: – the addition of clear references to the Directive on a European company (SE), in particular, to its standard rules in respect of the election of members to the administrative or supervisory board, – the simplification of the impracticable provision of Article 34; the significant lowering of the thresholds, – the stipulation that a European private company really is active across borders. We call on the Commission to finally get the 14th 
Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of a limited company moving, as the rights of worker participation in the cross-border transfer of registered offices can only sensibly be ensured by a Europe-wide directive on worker participation.

 Mr President, I will in a moment be presenting the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a somewhat insane undertaking and just as insane as the way in which some of our debates were organised, with such results. For this reason I would just make one comment, for there is not enough time for anything more. The Commissioner has again just pointed out that in the Commission’s opinion ownership unbundling is somehow – to use his words – the most efficient solution. We doubt that, because it cannot be verified either empirically or theoretically; certainly not empirically, for there are plenty of examples to show that even after ownership unbundling undertakings do not operate so smoothly. Neither can it be verified theoretically. It is and remains a monopoly, a natural monopoly, and monopolies do not have much to do with free competition. What therefore matters is not so much the question of ownership but rather of regulation. The sector has to be strictly regulated and this has to apply to unbundled network operators just as much as to non-unbundled network operators. We have made a number of proposals to this effect in the ECON Committee and we would hope that these proposals could also be taken on board.

 Madam President, while I am, of course, speaking for my group, I speak primarily as the person who prepared the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I can do no other than agree with the rapporteur, Mr Hasse Ferreira, and endorse what he has to say in his report to the effect that services of general interest are not only an important element in social and economic cohesion, but also make a considerable contribution to the competitiveness of the European economy, and this is particularly true of those services of general interest that are social in character. It is not for me to evaluate Mr Hasse Ferreira’s proposals in detail, but I am duty bound to draw your attention once more to what we in this House formerly resolved on the basis of my own report on the White Paper on services of general interest. I can do no other than confirm that Mr Hasse Ferreira has taken on board what our committee has drafted on this subject, and has done so in a manner that we find satisfactory. Services of general interest are meant to be of high quality, accessible and universally available, while also being rendered at optimum cost, respecting social balance and on the basis of lasting security of supply. While it goes without saying that services of general interest can be rendered under conditions of fair competition, the principle of equal treatment for private and public enterprises must at the same time apply, although the rules of the market must not impede the performance of public services, and this is best guaranteed by targeted measures and regulations specific to individual sectors, which will require an ongoing assessment of public services in the European Union in order to determine where proposals need to be worked out to address problem areas. We have already urged the Commission to do something about greater legal certainty in these areas and, where necessary, to draft a proposal for a sector-specific directive; all I can do at the present moment is to reiterate the need for that.

 Mr President, Mrs Merkel, in her speech, used the well-worn image of the house created by European integration, and I believe that image is a good one; that is why it is used so often. I particularly liked what she said about that house having a soul and about the need for us to find it. It has to be said, though, that building a house involves a variety of people. It involves architects; many of the architects have now spoken. It also involves, though, small-time artisans, and those who have to add the finishing touches to the work, and such artisans are an honourable trade, among whose number I count myself. You have to be rather careful what tools these craftsmen are allowed to get their hands on. I would ask you not to allow the couple of references you have made to the subject to be taken too far. We are all alongside you and alongside those who advocate cutting back bureaucracy, but it is when that is used as a means of agitating against regulations that we actually need that I have a problem with it, for a proper community cannot live without proper rules. As our former President, Mr Borrell, said, ‘better lawmaking’ does not mean the absence of regulation; that is what you have to look out for, and, above all, you should also take care that the European Union is not always left to introduce those rules alone. If you want to press on with cutting back bureaucracy, then you will have to take action, not only at Member State level, but also across the European Union as a whole, for I can tell you from personal experience of the way things are in my own country – although I cannot speak about the situation in other Member States – that the bureaucratic hindrances thrown up by the Member State itself are far more numerous than those originating from the European Union.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, having the President of the Commission present for a debate on an own-initiative report is not an everyday occurrence, for an own-initiative report is not exactly an outstanding event when what we are actually meant to be doing is making laws – although I shall turn to that in a moment. What your presence here demonstrates is that the Commission is clear in its own mind about how important this issue is in the eyes of the public, and hence, too, in those of the citizens’ representatives here in this House. It is for that reason that I would like to refer back to a previous President of the Commission, and not just any old President, but Jacques Delors, who, a few months ago, addressing a meeting of the Committee of the Regions, attempted to place services of general interest in the context of the project of European integration. He told the Committee of the Regions that the work of European integration took three principles as its frame of reference: solidarity, which brings people together and has social, economic and territorial cohesion as its objectives; cooperation, whereby it is intended that the transnational and European aspirations of the EU’s treaties and programmes be fulfilled, and competition, which is meant to make possible the completion of the internal market on the secure basis of the rules of the social market economy and governed by democratic competition law aimed primarily at limiting the misuse of economic power and guaranteeing consumers the protection of the law. Although these three principles refer to services of general interest and to services of general economic interest, there are always tensions inherent in the relationships of the corners of this sort of triangle, and, where services of general interest and services of general economic interest are concerned, it is obvious where they lie. Public services have an essential part to play in the quality of life enjoyed by individual citizens; they also have a key role in the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy. Good public services can help overcome economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation, to reinforce social and territorial cohesion, to improve, both internally and externally, the European single market’s functioning, and to enable it to compete better. Even so, whenever I am in the region from which I come or visiting others, and sit down with local politicians and the providers of services of general interest to discuss these, I have to deal with their complaints to the effect that we are interfering in their remits, making their jobs more difficult, and failing to make clear under what conditions they can operate. Their claim is that they do not, where the law is concerned, actually know where they stand. It is for that reason that appropriate legal initiatives to afford them that legal certainty would appear to be necessary. There will be those who, in the course of this debate, will ask what we are actually after – after all, they will say, do we not have the Commission to issue communications and enact guidelines, and the Court of Justice to lay down the law? – and to them I have to say that that is evidently not enough, and, moreover, it does indeed contribute to the prevailing legal uncertainty, for the Commission, with its communications and guidelines, does nothing to create legal certainty. It may well suggest that it does, but the fact is that a communication is not the sort of black-and-white law on which one can rely. We really must take the initiative in matters of law, and we are also making proposals as to how we can do this, not all of which I want to discuss, but the point I would make to you, Mr President of the Commission, is that the right of initiative that you possess is also a duty of initiative, and I urge you to make use of it. The building blocks for such legal initiatives are to be found in the resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, as well as in the resolutions we have already adopted, in, for example, the Langen and Herzog reports. We are not prescribing a specific instrument; that is for you to do. Our allotted task is to give our own assessment – each group for itself – of the Commission legislative thinking, and we will, after further debate, give our own assessment of the proposal for a framework directive that our group has put forward. Others must do the same with their own proposals; then we, working together in this House, must move the legislative process forward, and for that, the codecision procedure is an absolute requirement. It is within that procedure that we need legal initiatives, for it is not you and your fellow Commissioner, together with the highly qualified and well motivated staff of the Commission, nor indeed the national governments, but we, the Members of the European Parliament, who enjoy the legitimacy conferred by election. It is we who have to get down to the grass roots and discuss these things with the local politicians to whom we are accountable; it is we who bear responsibility for what is done. It is for that reason that the codecision procedure must apply, and for that reason that this House must exercise its prerogatives in full.

 Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by expressing my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, something that I do not normally do, believing as I do that the function of a rapporteur is to deliver a proper job of work and that thanks are not called for when things are done as a matter of course. This has, though, indeed been a really complex business, and one that Mr Seppänen has handled outstandingly well. The debate has not, of course, only just started; we and a number of other Members already know each other from the previous Parliament and were there for the first reading, which was already complicated enough. The Council has now joined Parliament in adopting many of the things that we debated at first reading stage – initially with some acrimony – and then accepted, and we can actually be content with that. It just so happens, though, that new parliaments bring with them new people, with new ideas and new proposals. Our new Members did, of course, have new ideas, and the fact that a compromise had very largely already been reached with the Council meant that it was very difficult to take these on board. I know that Mr Seppänen was already in favour of our adopting the Commission proposal and the Council position without significant amendment, and so he has done a good job of getting Parliament’s interests across and successfully negotiating their acceptance by the Council. I will come to the point, though: neither on the energy market nor any other do we want competition for the sake of it, but we are well aware that competition is in fact a suitable means whereby a common market’s efficiency gains really can be maximised. This common market and the exploitation of these efficiency gains demand that we open up the national market segments and turn them into a single internal market in energy, and hence require transparent and discrimination-free access to the networks. We see this Regulation as making provision for the enactment of more specific, detailed and binding guidelines, thereby complementing the 2003 internal market directive on the complete opening-up of the gas markets. Among other things, this Regulation is meant to bring in more explicit requirements with regard to transparency, also requiring network operators to offer third parties services providing access to the network and, in particular, less ambiguous structures for tariffs. It is this tariff structure that is essential if competitors are to enjoy transparent and discrimination-free access when using the networks, for such networks are monopolistic by nature, and it is only by regulating access to them that we will be able to get them under control and make them transparent and non-discriminatory. That is why it was important, in one instance that I want to draw to your particular attention, for us to again tighten up the common position on the tariff structure, having already got many other points accepted. The fact is that it is not sufficient to ensure that the tariffs laid down include relatively abstract efficiency incentives. Tariffs must be measured against the benchmark of the costs of an efficient network operator with a comparable structure; this is what this House devised and got accepted for cross-border trade in electricity, and it is also suited to the gas networks. That being so, it should be generally supported in the House.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like, on behalf of my group, to wish Mr Bowis a speedy recovery. I know that he was working hard in the committee until the last day of the vote, and I hope, now, that he recuperates after his operation and gets well soon and that we will be seeing him here again before the summer recess. Allow me to start by saying that my group thinks this is a very good report. We can see that the Commission’s proposal has been thoroughly improved by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by compromises that we reached together. Commissioner Vassiliou, you and your team produced good work, but there was scope for improvement, and we have succeeded in improving it. We have managed to ensure that all patients will now know that they have rights in the European Union just like everyone else does. They can move around, just as is self-evident for every worker, every student and for goods, services and other things. Patients, too, are to have their rights in the internal market. That is what this legislation lays down, and for that reason we welcome it unreservedly. We must also point out, however, which areas of the report we particularly approved of. These include, for example, the fact that patients are to be granted free movement for non-hospital care. We also think, however, that the Member States should retain the competence for their healthcare systems. They should be able to plan for their hospital care, their specialist care, and their investments in the Member State in question should be affordable. We do not seek to take away this authority, this competence, from the Member States. Nor do we want them to be bled dry. It is therefore right for there to be prior authorisation for certain kinds of treatment. This, too, is something that my group is very happy to give its full backing to, and I will return to this issue at the end. This is a good approach, which is something that characterises the report as a whole. One thing that I very much welcome, on a personal level, is the fact that there are to be reference networks at long last. How long have we been demanding that it must be clear where in the European Union best practice is taking place? Where are treatments being performed best? Where are they being most successful? Which team in which hospital in which Member State has news to report? At the moment, this is left to chance. Perhaps a small part of the scientific community knows about it, but not every local doctor. The fact that we are able to improve this situation through the advent of reference networks is a great achievement. These sources of information will enable every patient in every Member State to drop in or call up and ask, ‘What are my rights?’ They will be told in their own language what their rights are and, where they have a problem, they will get an answer. This is a positive development. As I reach the end of my speaking time, I must also mention those areas that the majority of my group find regrettable. For the vast majority of my group, this involves two items that are critical for us and for our voting behaviour today. The first of these is that we want to see a dual legal basis. We need to use the health article, Article 152, in order to ensure that the message that we are sending out to the world is that this is an issue of health policy as well as of freedom of movement. We need this, and it is a condition of our support. Furthermore, we are convinced that prior authorisation, as set out in Article 8(3), is inadequately defined. If we are unable to obtain an improvement in this through the amendments that have been tabled, my group will not, unfortunately, be able to bring itself to vote through this report, which is something that I personally regret, although perhaps this will act as a spur to do better at second reading if we do not make enough ground today.
 Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will probably not need the four minutes that are allocated to me at the start of the debate, as it is really a very simple and very pleasant matter that we are discussing today. We are discussing a new version of the Cosmetics Directive, which is now a regulation. This Regulation will, in fact, be brought up to date, and we would very much like to update it, improve it and make it more coherent. We have three minor improvements in mind. On the one hand, the Regulation ensures that the use of carcinogenic substances in cosmetics has indeed been banned, but we have to keep a sense of proportion, so that substances which are permitted for use in foodstuffs are not banned for use in cosmetics, such as vitamin A or alcohol. This is something that the Commission has correctly recognised and taken into account in its proposal. The Commission also rightly recognised the fact that new technologies, such as nanotechnology, need special attention, in particular when we are dealing with microscopic particles which may be able to pass through layers of skin. We simply want to ensure that they present no danger. Here, too, I am satisfied that we have achieved a compromise which I can wholeheartedly support. Finally, Mr President, there is something else we have to address, namely the product claims. We also ought to examine them and bring them up to date. If we got here today, having rushed to get here, and if our deodorant promised us this morning that we would be sweat-free for 14 hours, but we are nevertheless totally covered in sweat this evening, then we are likely to be very surprised and say that there is no truth to the claim at all. Claims that deliver what they promise are an important part of an honest, credible product. We have legislation to ensure safe products and, at the same time, to ensure genuine and clear products. I am very grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency. I would particularly like to thank Mrs Popadičová, who cannot be here today, but who really has done her best, something that has not always been easy in this Council. I would also like to offer particular thanks to the Commission, whose cooperation was extremely constructive and successful. That, too, is not always the case in this Chamber. Moreover, I would like to thank my colleagues, namely my female colleagues who have been working on this issue for a long time. I would like to thank Françoise Grossetête, Margret Auken, Hiltrud Breyer and also Fréderique Ries, who cannot be here today, for their cooperation. We did not always agree on issues such as how to deal with notification in relation to nanotechnology and what should be done in terms of labelling, but we managed to reach an excellent compromise. I am very pleased about this. I would just like to say something about the issue of labelling. I think that certain delegations, perhaps even my own delegation and my own Member State, need to take note of a few things. Labelling has nothing to do with warning signs. Labels allow consumers to make free and informed choices. Consumers have a right to be informed about nanotechnologies and to know that a specific substance contains particularly small, even microscopic particles. They have the right to decide whether they want to use sun lotion and whether they want to use the sun lotion on their children. Consumers have the right to decide. I myself would happily do it and would be happy to use the products myself. Others would not. However, it is important for us to make sure that all people are in a position to make these choices. I know that you, Commissioner Verheugen, are going to make a statement today on the whole issue of preventing the counterfeiting of medicines. I am very grateful and I hope that you will also address the matter of the threat posed by, or the opportunities related to, internet trade. If you do this, then tomorrow when we vote on the version of the compromise which the Council already voted on last week will be a better day for some of my colleagues, who generally support this compromise, but would like some additional assurances. Thank you very much.
 Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,  
rapporteur. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, thank you very much, Commissioner, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for once again highlighting the ban on animal testing, as it has reminded me that this is now the third revision of the cosmetic products legislation that I have had the privilege to be involved in, these revisions being the sixth amendment, the seventh amendment, and now the change to a regulation. We have, indeed, succeeded in banning animal testing. We have, for example, managed to ensure that consumers know the shelf life of a product, by means of a small box containing a number which tells them how long a product can be used for. I am also addressing these comments to certain colleagues, such as Mrs Roithová, who unfortunately were not able to be present at the start of this debate. Labels have never, at any point, been warnings. If a product is not safe, it should not be brought onto the market, it should not be marketed. All products on the European market have to be safe and harmless. However, labelling allows consumers to choose. That is what democracy is all about, and that is what freedom of choice is all about. We have an excellent piece of legislation. I have tried to make the process very transparent. I have tried, as Mrs Grossêtete has said, to bring together various opinions. This is because I wanted to ensure that we draw up legislation which is good for everyone, namely for the consumers in the European Union, for industry, which will have to work with this legislation, and, finally, for everyone who benefits from it. I would just like once again to say to Mr Schnellhardt that yes, deodorants work differently on different people, but the claim is nevertheless made that they ‘keep you sweat-free’. That is why it is important that the claims concerning the deep rings around my eyes after a week in Strasbourg are, to a certain extent, true and reliable. Once again, I would like to thank the Commissioner, particularly for the explanations he has given, as well as my colleagues and my co-workers, who have done most of the work. Thank you very much.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Grossetête for her work on this report. It has been a pleasure to work with her, and she has undoubtedly achieved two things with the compromise she has reached. Firstly, she has made a procedure simpler and less bureaucratic and, secondly, she has met the needs and requirements of small enterprises in individual Member States with purely national systems and authorisations in a flexible manner, and done them a great favour. The report by Mrs Grossetête is also connected with patient safety, and this is another issue we are discussing today. We are speaking broadly about the safety of individuals, patient safety. Commissioner Verheugen rightly pointed out that, with the ageing of society, people’s health needs and fear of illness have grown ever larger. Fear is something that has already been growing in society for a long time, and it is up to us, where we have competence and where we are able, to keep this fear to a minimum or to tackle or resolve it as far as possible. A great many of the measures necessary to this end are ones on which we have competence and are able to give advice. One among very many issues is undoubtedly patient information and the safety of medicinal products. Patients are entitled to be fully informed about their illness; and, if they are fully informed and able to act on a par with medical practitioners, they must be entitled to safe medicinal products and safe treatment methods. This is not the case in the European Union at present, and we are conscious of a growing danger. I am really not one to dramatise; I may sometimes be rather emotional, but I do not dramatise. I am also the last person who would arouse fear. Yet I would caution against overlooking, or closing our eyes to, a problem that exists. The banking crisis is a good current example of what happens if we omit to solve small problems we are capable of solving, if we wait too long: we find ourselves overcome by a giant wave of almost tsunami proportions. That is why I thank Commissioner Verheugen for his words here today, and also urge him to be true to them and combat counterfeit medicines. There are no simple solutions to this problem, and those who believe that patient safety and the safety of medicinal products are an issue only with regard to parallel trade – I glance up at the gallery, but it is probably a little too early for the representatives of parallel trade – take too narrow a view and insult my intelligence and that of my fellow Members. What we must endeavour to do here is to protect patients. This can be done by means of various measures, for example, by checking whether the packaging of the medicinal product is intact. What would you say if you were to buy a product in your home country whose packaging was in a language you did not understand, with only a small sticker on it, and small, chopped-up blister packs inside? Would you have confidence in the product? I ended up with a pack such as this, containing an urgently needed medicine, and I can tell you that I did not have confidence in it. This is something we must prohibit, and I am sure that parallel traders – for it is they who evidently believe we wish to threaten their livelihoods, which is not the case – will have enough intelligence to find an alternative. They will come up with new packaging, or will at least stop cutting up blister packs. As Commissioner Verheugen pointed out, there are technical solutions. The medicinal products industry is prepared for a complete traceability system, with a bar code enabling the tracing of each medicinal product. In addition, there is a pilot project. Switzerland and Belgium have demonstrated that it is possible. It is our task to give patients this security. I should like to say a final word about ingredients, where the issue is not only with counterfeit medicines. As you know, there was a major scandal involving heparin – a blood-thinner. When people use a counterfeit medicine, they can die; it is extremely dangerous. We obtained these counterfeit preparations from China. It is also our task to ensure that no counterfeit preparations or active ingredients are produced in our third-country trading partners and that our markets are properly protected. Two things are needed to this end: we must properly protect our borders, we need traceability systems and we must ensure safety in these countries.
 Dagmar Roth-Behrendt  (PSE

 Mr President, I have a further two questions for Commissioner Verheugen. Commissioner, do you agree that the intactness of packs and bar codes on packs are no obstacle to additional forms of trade and that, on the contrary, with a modicum of intelligence, a bar code can be applied to another product or a patient information leaflet inserted in further repackaging? Do you agree that a modicum of intelligence, and the flexibility that is expected of all Europeans, is also to be expected of all those involved in the trade and distribution of medicinal products here in the European Union? I have one final question. We shall increasingly be seeing problems involving active ingredients entering the European Union from third countries. Do you envisage any prospect of our creating incentives to ensure that more active ingredients are produced in the European Union again and that manufacturers of medicinal products obtain these substances from within the EU rather than from countries in which we cannot guarantee their safety?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking today about a proposal that truly does focus on people in the European Union, namely patients. I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her introduction, but I also wish to express my gratitude to Mr Kyprianou for all the groundwork he has done at a difficult time. Why do I call it a difficult time? Because in many instances the Member States are still the last fossils left in this European Union, cast in stone, failing to understand that people are the focal point and believing that the world revolves around them and their systems. That is not the case. The focus is on patients, and they are the weakest links in our society, because they are ill and infirm. If we talk about patient mobility today, knowing that it is actually a right in the internal market, which means that it ought to have applied for more than twenty years, we should consider whether this is a timely debate and whether the Member States are abreast of the times. I tell you they are not! If the Eurobarometer is showing us today that 30% of all people in the European Union are unaware of their right to obtain treatment outside their own country, this means that all the Member States have been getting it wrong. They have not informed people of their rights; they have not been telling them what they are entitled to do and which options are open to patients. Yes, I share the view of Mr Bowis and others here, and the Commissioner too, that the Member States should certainly retain their autonomous health systems. We have no wish to interfere with that, but we also want to ensure that patients have freedom of movement. In connection with Member States’ autonomy, I also recognise the need to be able to plan ahead, particularly when it comes to in-patient treatment. For this reason, authorisation will have to be one of the main topics of our discussions. Mr Bowis has already made that point. Networks and information points must ensure that patients know what they are allowed to do, but they must also know where the best treatment is available – whether it be in Germany or in Cyprus – so that patients also have the opportunity to be cured. If we succeed in improving the quality of health care and people’s access to health care close to home, that will surely be a marvellous achievement, and no one need shop around anymore. That is what we really want.

Mr President, we all feel compassion for those who have lost relatives or friends, but also for those who have lost much of what is important to them in their lives on a very personal level. Yes, we feel sympathy, and yes, it is the European Union’s task to show solidarity. That is our fundamental principle, and we want to apply it in this instance too, and yes, in this way, we also want to fulfil our responsibility, which we owe to every one of our fellow countries in the European Union. If we are expected to take on responsibility, however, then we can expect some responsibility in return. We must ask ourselves: could this have been avoided? I am looking in the direction of my fellow Members who have spoken, longstanding Members of this House who have already adopted numerous laws and action programmes. There are good grounds for saying, yes, it could have been avoided. Nine years have passed since the European Parliament adopted the Action Programme for Civil Protection, and what is the Programme about, Mr Trakatellis? You were involved in its development, as were many others. The Programme consists of providing assistance promptly, but it is also about providing training and organising information events so that people at local level are taught how to react and get help quickly. That should, perhaps, have been possible in this instance too, but probably not everyone is proficient enough yet. What about the 'Forest Focus' scheme? Is forest management actually being taken seriously? In those countries of the European Union which are always hot in summer – in other words, all of Southern Europe – are fire lanes envisaged at all? Or is that not lucrative enough? These are all things which we need to think about. If we are willing to take on the responsibility that we owe, then we have the right to demand responsibility as well. What about waste policy? We have frequently been told that there are Member States which do not take it very seriously. We have been told time and again by the European Commission that there are countries which are not complying with the current legislation. Of course, that means that a thoughtlessly discarded cigarette end can instantly cause a fire. Yes, we want to show solidarity and provide assistance. However, what is this reaction force about? I have a question for everyone here today who is calling for a European reaction force and perhaps even a European fire service. Let me ask them this: how many million people in 27 countries are these supposed to serve? Almost 500 million? These Members are either charmingly naive, straight out of a fairy tale, or they are populist: one or the other. We should not delude the people out there into believing that the European Union in Brussels – at the Commission or here in this House – could possibly provide enough fire fighters or rescue workers to intervene for us when disasters occur. We need communication structures, and we must call up helicopters from Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic when they are needed, the very same day. After all, there is an early warning system for certain events in the food sector. There, the deadline is 12 hours. I believe we would want to achieve a faster response time than 12 hours there too. I believe we should be honest to the people out there and say, yes, we can give money, and yes, we can set up communication structures. We can try to help, but you need to take responsibility at local level as well, wherever you are, be it Germany, Northern Europe, Southern Europe or anywhere else. As dreadful as this situation is at the moment, and as much as we feel compassion and must show solidarity, by the day after tomorrow, we must have identified what needs to change.

 Mr President, I simply want to stress that I myself, and members of some of the other political groups, used their democratic right to table amendments in due time. I wish to underline that all of the amendments in block one reflect the votes in committee and are in line with an agreement reached in a technical trialogue with the rapporteur, who then decided not to continue with that trialogue. We did not exceed our powers in relation to any of those items and I would propose that we proceed to the vote. I always respect the democratic procedures applicable here. (Applause)

 Mr President, I shall say just two sentences about the substance of the matter in hand – with which all of us present here are familiar – and would then like to say something about the procedure. Thousands of patients right across the European Union are waiting in desperation for new kinds of therapy that might alleviate their suffering or even save their lives. To all those who think certain categories of therapy have to be excluded, in whatever country and with whatever laws being in force, I say, once more, here and now, what I said in the committee, and yes, I do mean it: you are cynical, you are irresponsible, and you should be ashamed of yourselves; now take your ideas and put them to the patients – face to face. Mrs Breyer is not squeamish either, so you can say it to her as well. I should now like to say something about the procedure.  I will do this in English so that Mr Mikolášik will understand me directly. Mr Mikolášik spoke about tabling amendments without the knowledge of the rapporteur. It is not necessarily usual that one clears it with the rapporteur, Mr Mikolášik. I would have loved to do that with you, but you stopped cooperating at an early stage in the trialogues. I want to read out what we – Mrs Ries, Mr Adamou and others here – did, so that everybody is clear. We tabled a package of 75 amendments. 32 are exactly identical to the amendments from the committee; 18 amendments are slight linguistic changes; 10 amendments are working on a compromise which you and I already agreed on before you stopped cooperating, and 15 amendments are linguistic or legal concerns. That is the situation we are in at the moment. I now want to add something concerning what you said before on the interinstitutional agreement. I think we should just have a result as soon as possible. Mr Mikolášik, you also said that we should have a first-reading agreement. I agree, because thousands of people are waiting for it. I am very grateful to the Commission and to the Council, who really supported us in reaching a result. From my point of view, they have come as close to Parliament’s positions as they could – going further than I have seen before and further than I expected them to go. Naturally, Mr Mikolášik, we compromised, you compromised and I compromised. In fact I made a compromise as regards your group’s position on hospital exemptions and other things, because I thought, as some of you think, we should have a strong, safe regulation which makes sure that patients get the best scientific support and the best therapies in safe surroundings. As regards the so-called ‘ethical’ amendments, yes, Member States who want to ban the use of foetal stem cells should be allowed to do so, and, Mrs Breyer, everybody who says that the Court of Justice would deny that and would put it under Article 95 is either not knowledgeable – which you are not – and then giving the wrong impression, I am afraid. If you read Article 30 of the Treaty, you are exactly sure that it says that public morality is always a reason to make sure that a Member State can ban something. And that is what happened in the past. That is what is happening at the moment in the European Union. We have always said that those Member States who allow research on it could continue. However, the patients also deserve the right to have the safest, best products available, and that is why I tabled an amendment on subsidiarity, to make sure of that again. That amendment is in the package. It says that every Member State which thinks a product should not even be produced there, nor marketed, should be allowed to ban it. In other Member States, the patients should have the freedom to obtain it. That is what we are here for.
 President.  
– The next item is the report (A6-0399/2006
) by Mrs Hieronymi on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the coordination of certain provisions laid down in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (COM(2005)0646
 – C6-0443/2005
 – 2005/0260(COD)
).
 President.  
 I shall be happy to enlighten you, Mrs Rühle. The fact is that you will, later on, have another minute when you speak on behalf of your group, but, as spokeswoman for a committee, you are entitled to only one minute. I shall leave it to you to sort that out within your group to your own satisfaction. You will, of course, be able to recapitulate the essential points when you speak later on on behalf of your group.
 Dagmar Roth-Behrendt,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my supposition is that 99.9% of my group will vote in favour of this compromise put together by Mr Sacconi; If anyone could negotiate this difficult path between Scylla and Charybdis it was probably he – he who was always available for dialogue, who tried to achieve compromise even though he always had his own ideas in his mind, and that compromise is one that is acceptable to large sections of this House and of the European public. What are we talking about? We are talking about learning something about chemicals of which we are at present ignorant. We are talking about our desire to protect nature, and, above all, the health of those people who use chemicals, whether as consumers or as workers with them. With that end in mind, the compromise is a good one. A compromise remains, of course, a compromise and nothing more. The best proof of its being a good one is probably that nobody ends up being really satisfied. Mr Sacconi is certainly not one hundred percent happy with it, and nor, as a whole, are we, but, even so, I am persuaded that this is the best that we could have achieved. It is, at any rate, better than many other proposals that I have had sight of, and so, on Wednesday, I too shall be voting in favour and will be doing so out of conviction. What, though, do we have here in black and white? Many describe it as a monster. Of course, it is not one. The description of ‘monstrous’ is far better applied to the forty pieces of legislation that we had before. This is a compact package, and not one that is easily read by all, but those who make the effort can manage it. It is also a good thing that we have agreed to review its scope in five years’ time, but what will happen to medical apparatus or other individual products then? Does this have to cover them, or would we be better advised to exclude them? That would make sense; it is also right that we have made improvements where the protection of data is concerned. Whatever the demands of transparency and people’s entitlement to information, data must be protected; we also have to ensure that there is active support for research projects and that research can still be carried out at universities and other facilities. All these things are good. So what is not good? What is not good is what is going to happen to small and medium-sized businesses. Commissioner Verheugen said so, and I am grateful to him for so doing; if we are not watchful, it is the small and medium-sized enterprises who could end up picking up the tab for our ambitious legislation, and it is time we gave some thought to them. What I urge Commissioners Dimas and Verheugen to do is to amend the definition for small and medium-sized businesses; that is long overdue and will help some of them, but I also urge them to set up a helpdesk that will help such firms, translate for them, and actually ensure that they get help, for the ones this legislation will affect do not know to which transition period they are subject, when – and for what – they have to register, or when this or that will start to apply to them. Let me conclude by saying that, if we are serious about this – and to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten as much as to anyone else, I emphasise the ‘if’ – then we will make sure that a good and effective agency is in place without delay. That will involve money. That is something that the Council Presidency will have to deal with; let it tell the Council’s members that that is what we need the money for. We in this House must do likewise. My apologies to Mr Ouzký; normally I stay until the end of any debate in which I have spoken, but I now have a meeting of this House’s Bureau to go to.
 President.  
 The next item is the debate on –	the oral question to the Commission on the reintegration of breast cancer patients into the job market and use of social funds for continued training of health professionals in the field of breast cancer, by Mr Andersson and Mrs Jöns on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (O-0098/2006
 – B6-0433/2006
), –	the oral question to the Commission on the early detection and treatment of breast cancer in the enlarged European Union by Mr Florenz and Mrs Jöns on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (O-0101/2006
 – B6-0434/2006
) and –	the oral question to the Commission on breast cancer by Mrs Záborská and Mrs Jöns on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality (O-0116/2006
 – B6-0436/2006
).
 President.  
 Thank you, Mrs Jöns. That is a very personal thank you.
 President.  
 Thank you, Mrs Jöns. Although I am meant only to be chairing this debate, I shall do what I am not supposed to do and endorse your call for the guidelines to be put on the Web. The Commission does not need to use the book as a means of recovering its costs.
 President.  
 A motion for a resolution (B6-0528/2006
) to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
 President.  
 I am much obliged to you, Mr Tajani. We will pass that on to the President, who, I am sure, will cause those things to be done that need to be done.
 President.  
 The next item is the report (A6-0275/2006
) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest (2005/2101(INI)
).
 President.  
 I am sure that we, as this Parliament moves into the second half of its term, will again have to give some thought to the need for rapporteurs for lead committees, and also the draftsmen of opinions for others, to do that to which Mr Langen has just referred. Irrespective of the group to which they belong, they reflect the mind and the voting behaviour of the committee. I am convinced that all of them have done so today, and anyone who is in any doubt about that can re-read the reports. I have to say that I, as an outsider unfamiliar with the subject-matter, did wonder when I heard some of the speeches, but this is something we will be able to return to during the life of the next Parliament – perhaps as part of a reform of this House. Mrs Stauner will now have the opportunity to be the last to put her committee’s point of view.
 President.  
 The next item is the report (A6-0193/2006
) by Mrs Gröner on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on the proposal and the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ‘Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information’ as part of the General programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’ (COM(2005)0122
 – COM (2006)0230  C6-0388/2005
  2005/0037A(COD)
).
 President.  
 The next speaker ought to be Mrs Lévai, but she does not appear to be present in the Chamber either. That brings us to the end of the speakers’ list. In giving the floor to Commissioner Frattini, I will apologise to him for the House’s unruly state, which is attributable to our keenness to move to the vote. Nevertheless, Commissioner, the rapporteur and the whole House are interested to hear what you will be saying to us. I have to inform the honourable lady Member that I cannot add her to the end of the speakers’ list. No, I am sorry, but you were not at your seat when I called you. The same applies to you as to Mrs Kauppi.  Colleagues, if somebody is not in their seat during a debate, it is the President of the sitting’s decision not to give them the floor afterwards. (Applause)
 It is a question of politeness, Mrs Kauppi, to be here not only for your speaking time, but also to listen to others.
 President.  
 Mrs Kauppi, I am a long-standing Member of this House. I know that it is difficult to know exactly when your speaking time will be, but I say again, and with all due humility, that I personally – you may think differently – find it polite to listen to the debate, to be here before your speaking time. If that was the case each time then this could not happen. Your name came up on the screen, as did other Members’ names – such as that of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, for example. They were surprised that some colleagues were not here, so their speaking time was brought forward by five minutes. I cannot help that. I can only invite everyone who speaks in a debate to be here from the beginning of the debate. If that were the case then this would not happen to you again. That applies to everyone who was absent from the Chamber when I called their names. I called five or six people who were not here today and so they could not speak. Normally, when we have a lot of time, I am very happy, as every Vice-President is, to add names at the end of a debate. However, we cannot do that today as we have to vote on the report. I should now like to give the floor to Commissioner Frattini.
 President.  
 Thank you very much, Commissioner. Colleagues, I should just like to remind those who were not here earlier why we have had problems today with the timing of the debate. Commissioner Mandelson decided to speak for 28 minutes instead of the 12 or 15 minutes maximum. We must clarify such things in the relationship between Parliament and the Commission. We cannot solve it today, but that is what causes the problems. I apologise for the fact that voting time has had to be delayed.
 President.  
 The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12 noon. Written statement (Rule 142)
 President.  
 Thank you, Mr Tajani, and thank you also for informing us of this. I am sure that the House will endorse what you have said.
 President.  
 Thank you, Mrs Frassoni. Mrs Frassoni has made reference to what emerged from the Bureau meeting last night, with which I am sure not all Members will be familiar. Mrs Frassoni, I would recommend not only that you write to the President about this matter, but also that you inform your Secretaries-General and your Joint Chairman, and get this raised in the Conference of Presidents. The matter you have raised was resolved by being voted on in the Bureau yesterday – albeit with a narrow result. If you want to raise it again, I am sure you will have to do that via the Groups, who, I am sure, will take the matter up and write to the President.
 President.  
 The next item is the report (A6-0072/2006
) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Road safety: bringing eCall to citizens (2005/2211(INI)
).
 President.  
 The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Belarus – the political situation after the elections.
 President.  
 Many thanks, Mr Krarup. The request to amend the agenda was announced yesterday; I assume that this was discussed in the groups. I announced the amendment of the agenda this morning, together with details of who had proposed the amendment, which groups were involved and the number of signatures received. No protests were forthcoming from the House. I am sure that the honourable Member will raise the matter in his group.

 The next item is the report (A6-0041/2006
) by Mr Bushill-Matthews on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations (2005/2147(INI)
).
 President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner. Your obvious engagement made it impossible for me to interrupt you when your allotted ten minutes of speaking time were up. It would have broken my heart to interrupt you. However, we are running out of time and we must move on quickly.
 President.  
 Mr de Villiers, I should like to point out that we had a problem with the timing. You should have one-and-a-half minutes, when only one minute was allotted. That was a mistake and we cannot clarify where it came from. However, when I give someone the floor I always state how much time is allowed. I would appreciate, in future, that if there is a discrepancy, you point it out immediately. I will now allow you one minute of speaking time as it is impossible to speak coherently in the remaining 30 seconds.
 President.   
The debate is now suspended and will continue at 9 p.m. We come now to Question Time and I would like to thank the Council Presidency representative, Mr Winkler, for being flexible and allowing us to run slightly over time.
 President.  
 The debate is closed.
 President.  
 The next item is the joint debate on - the report (A6-0391/2005
) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (COM(2005)0263

 – C6-0245/2005
 – 2005/0120(CNS)
).
 President.  
 Mr Didžiokas, you are talking too quickly, and reading out your speeches too quickly, and you are not the only one. The interpreters cannot keep up with you, and so time is wasted. It will be of much greater benefit to what you want to convey if you speak either more slowly or without a prepared speech.
 President.  
 The debate is suspended until 9 p.m.
 President.  
 The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0377/2005
), by Mrs Wortmann-Kool on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (9856/2005 – C6-0274/2005

) by Mr Wijkman on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on Winning the Battle Against Global Climate Change (2005/2049(INI)
).
 President.  
 I will pass that on to the President of Parliament. I am sure that Mr Borrell will be grateful for that suggestion and will write the letter to which you refer. I am equally persuaded that you will assist him with your expertise and can suggest some forms of words that he might use. What I actually wanted to do now was to announce as the next item the Commission statement on progress towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania. I will indeed do that, but I will wait for a moment in the hope that the Commissioner can manage to get out of the Commission meeting and come to us, as it would make sense to wait until we have heard what Commissioner Rehn has to say about the Commission statement on Bulgaria’s and Romania’s progress towards accession before discussing it. Otherwise we would go straight into the debate. I assume that honourable Members will want to hear the Commissioner before they make their own contributions. Much obliged though I am to the various groups for their suggestions, I will nonetheless wait a moment more. I am looking at the Commission benches, which are not entirely vacant, and will try to find out whether someone there can give me an idea when we can expect Commissioner Rehn to turn up.
 President.  
 The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on progress towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania.
 President.  
 I am sorry, that is not a point of order. I have cut off your microphone. You can make a point order if you wish, but please tell me the Rule. Just simply asking the Commission to be on time is all very well but not very polite, especially when the Commissioner told you that he left the Commission meeting. We are not going to have a discussion about that.
 President.  
 Mr Beazley, that was not a point of order. Nevertheless, I will pass on the message to the President of Parliament and he can tell the UK Presidency that we always appreciate its presence in the Chamber.
 President.  
 The debate is closed. I have received six motions for a resolution(1)
 to close this debate pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.

 The next item is the joint debate on the report (A6-0255/2005
) by Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Fourth Amending Budget for 2005 (Tsunami) (11220/2005 – C6 0239/2005 – 2005/2079(BUD)), and the report (A6-0254/2005

 Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, 
 on behalf of the PSE Group. – (DE)
 Mr President, although the success of this legislation has been mentioned, it is something that should be emphasised again and again. I shall tell you in a minute why I find the pedantry, and sometimes even the simplicity, of this debate distasteful. We have tabled amendments in committee – I have even tabled them myself – stating the need for this legislation to enter into force more quickly, the reason being that we have waited so long for it, on behalf of the children in the European Union. In addition – and this I say for Mrs Toia’s benefit – the role of the Paediatric Committee, which is to be set up in accordance with the legislation, must be enhanced. We have an interest in a strong Paediatric Committee, and what is more one which takes the lead. I agree with Mr Bowis, Mrs Grossetête and all the others who have said that we need the MICE research programme, another EU initiative. This must be given a proper basis in law, and the proper place for it is in the Seventh Framework Research Programme. I would ask Commissioner Verheugen to urge the Commission that scope and funding be made available for this within the Seventh Framework Research Programme. I have said that this is a great success, and so I regret that this success is not being given due emphasis in this debate. I find it cheap, pitiful and even shameful that this debate has focused almost exclusively on the extension of patent protection. It is interesting that there has been no discussion of the ten-year extension of data protection for medicinal products whose patent protection has expired: ‘PUMA’, as it is known. We should ask ourselves why this is not being discussed: because it creates a level playing field, as it were, between generic medicinal products and pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research. Not a single word has been spoken about it: despite going much further – ten-year data protection – it evidently enjoys widespread approval. Yet a dispute of which I have seldom seen the like in this House has developed about a six-month period to be given to those pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research who still have a patent, or are applying for one. I would ask all of those who have a fixed opinion on this whether they have spoken to patients’ representatives; I have. I have also spoken to parents with sick children. They could not understand it. They could not understand this discussion, some of which they followed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. They were just saying, ‘We want these medicines for our children’. If what Commissioner Verheugen said does happen, and there is an incentive to procure more medicinal products more quickly, it will be marvellous; it will be exactly what we want. We do not care whether someone earns half a million more or less in the process. There should be considerable benefits to research, and children should also stand to gain. That is what patients’ and parents’ representatives are saying. I am a relatively long-standing Member of this House, and do not want to see it split into two, with the countries and representatives of countries which have no research-oriented pharmaceutical industry but only a generics industry objecting that six months is too long, and others saying the opposite. Our sole concern should be doing what is best for patients, which is what the Commission is proposing. The majority of my group will be supporting that, and so shall I. (Applause)
 President.  
 We now come to the votes. (For results and further details of the vote: see Minutes.)
 President.  
 That concludes the vote.
 President.  
 I am glad to be able to welcome to the House a delegation from the Indian Parliament, who are sitting in the Official Gallery. (Applause)
 The delegation is composed of four members of the House of the People and three members of the Council of States, led by the Vice-President of the Council of States, Mr Raman Khan. On behalf of this House, I welcome this delegation, which is in Strasbourg for the European Parliament’s twelfth Interparliamentary Meeting with India. Last year, a working party from this House met with their Indian counterparts in New Delhi, and this visit confirms the renewed interest in an exchange during the present Parliament, both the Indian parliament and our own being newly elected. We particularly welcome the ongoing and ever more fruitful cooperation with India, and we will play our part in deepening the cooperation between our Parliaments. A warm welcome to you! (Applause)
 President.  
 That concludes the debate. The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
 President.  
 The next item is the report (A6-0130/2005
) by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (COM(2003)0739
 – C5-0642/2003
 – 2003/0300(COD)).
 President.  
 The next item is the vote. (Results and other details of voting: see Minutes)
 President.  
 Your comments will be recorded in the Minutes, and the language services will be asked to carry out detailed examinations of the various language versions and their contents.
 President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you also for your brevity. That concludes the debate. The vote will take place at noon today.
 President.  
 The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0105/2005
) by Mr Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (COM (2004) 0607
  C6-0122/2004
  2004/0209(COD)).
 President.  
 Colleagues, we are in the middle of a debate and have approximately another eight minutes left, including the Commissioner’s statement. Please take your conversation outside. Those of you seated behind Mrs Klaß, please ask your colleagues to leave. That includes Mr Rasmussen and others. Could the huissiers please escort out of the Chamber those who are leaving the debate. Please sit down and be quiet for another eight minutes or leave the Chamber.
 President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you also for being patient with this House and for speaking under more difficult conditions than usual.  Mr Davies, is your point of order really necessary, considering that the vote is about to begin?
 President.  
 Mr Davies, we will take note of that in the Bureau, but it is also the fault of the House itself. I had to keep calling the House to order to give the speakers some quiet in which to speak. It is also the fault of certain political groups, because one-minute speeches never last for one minute, they always overrun. That can be dealt with in the Conference of Presidents. I would be happy to abolish one-minute speaking time slots in favour of two minutes. We can discuss the matter but we have to agree on it. The debate is closed. The vote will be tomorrow.

 – 2002/0259(COD)] (rapporteur: Satu Hassi).
 President.  
 Mrs McAvan, I sympathise with you, because for 15 years I too have been debating environmental legislation during the night sittings. But there we are, we will try for the future.

The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
 President.  
 Ladies and gentlemen, before I give the floor to Mr Nicolaï, on behalf of the Council, I would like to inform you that I have received seven motions for resolutions to wind up the debate. The vote on these motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. I shall now give the floor to Mr Nicolaï, on behalf of the Council.
 President. 
 – Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment before I give the floor to Mr Barroso. The formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands at 12 noon means that we will not be able to finish our debate, despite our efforts to be strict about time. The last three speakers will therefore take the floor after the formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands and after that we will begin the votes. I would crave your indulgence for this. Mr Barroso has the floor.
 President. 
 – Ladies and gentlemen, we will now suspend our debate for the formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands, after which the debate will resume with three further speakers.

 Madam President, it is fascinating to follow this debate – colleagues have already laid out the main topics and the Commissioner has made her statement – but to see that the Council is completely absent tells us a lot about the way we sometimes operate in the European Union. This is completely unacceptable. We are experiencing one of the gravest crises ever in the European Union and worldwide, and talking about a topic that is so relevant and so important for job creation – one of the areas where we still have stability to a large degree – and to see that the Council is not reflecting and debating with us today to my eyes tells us a lot. I hope that we will see the next Council Presidency here more often, because we cannot continue to operate in this way. Let me make two points. I want to thank the shadow rapporteur, Pilar del Castillo Vera, who has done great work. It was difficult, and it was not clear at the very beginning that we would make it and that we would have greater Europeanisation in this area. We seem to have found a way that is acceptable and that will help the national regulators to work together and to learn from each other. This will be a good breakthrough, especially for the new Member States. Let me touch on two points, which I am glad the Commissioner mentioned: investment in new infrastructure, which will have a new framework and work under competition rules which, although different, will allow investment to flow in this area; and the guidelines which will very soon be published for NGAs. I hope that those guidelines will follow the philosophy established in this House, from which I hope the Commissioner will not depart. On the universal service part, I hope that the Commissioner will find a way of ensuring that the telecom operators, which will now profit from new investment possibilities will, for their part, invest to make sure that all citizens have access to broadband in the future. I hope this will be covered by the Universal Service Directive, which is to come in the second half of the year. My last point would be to urge this House, my colleagues and the Commission – and the Council hopefully as well – to look into those areas where we have found compromises, but with which we are not completely happy. This touches on Internet issues, such as the way States can intervene if they think citizens are unlawfully accessing Internet content, which is something we call ‘Internet sparen
’ in German, and network management. I hope we will find a way to look into those issues during the second half of the year and find the right framework in order to build a greater consensus between us and the citizens, who are depending greatly on us.
 Erika Mann,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we are able to conclude this procedure at first reading is that we have succeeded in bringing about excellent cooperation across the group divide and with the other institutions. For this, I should like to offer particular thanks to my fellow MEPs, the Council, the Commission, the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the European Economic and Social Committee and, of course, the large body of researchers behind it all. We now have within reach concerted European research, in the context of future cooperation between the 22 National Metrology Institutes. This will introduce substantial Europeanisation into the important field of measurement. In addition, there is to be enhanced cooperation in future involving the five Member States not yet participating in this integration. We have achieved this by means of Article 169, which we apply when coordinating national and European research funding. Each amounts to EUR 200 million, and this will enable us to achieve cooperation between the nation-states. Research in the field of measurement covers a wide range of fields, from diabetes to the nanotechnology or space fields, and will be important to the whole field of standard setting in relation to CO2
 in future. So, then, I wish to reiterate my particular thanks to everyone involved. I hope that this will lead to enhanced European cooperation in this very important research area in future.

 Madam President, I will be very brief. I would just like to thank my colleagues and to recommend a positive vote in the assent procedure. However, I would love to have Commissioner Ashton’s confirmation again on the points we raised during our debate on Monday – specifically, Commissioner, when you committed yourself to giving the same preferences to Côte d’Ivoire that you had already accepted for SADC. You are nodding – perfect! Thank you so much.
 Erika Mann  (PSE

 Mr President, I should like to say a few words about our economic relationship. I should like to thank my colleague Mr Millán Mon for his excellent report. We need to remind ourselves of what we want to achieve. I mean, it was the European Parliament, with support much later from the Council and the Commission, which came up with this idea of having a stronger economic relationship and creating a transatlantic market. This idea of a transatlantic market was followed by the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). Each of those initiatives can only survive if there is strong support from both sides. Having a new government in the United States does not automatically mean that we will have strong support for the Economic Council, since we are occupied with an enormous economic and financial crisis. Therefore, I would urge both the Commission and the Council to ensure that the Transatlantic Economic Council will be given all the support necessary, because this is not automatically given. I would just like to remind you of three items on the agenda that are highly important and which we somehow need to solve. One is the trade dispute agenda. This agenda is still very broad, but I would like to concentrate on one subject that is important and this is the Airbus-Boeing case, which is before the WTO and is being postponed continuously. I would urge you to find a solution. It is not on the TEC agenda, but we need to find a solution soon, otherwise we will have difficulty in a major sector. My second plea is for you to ensure that we will finally have a road map and that we will have transparency on what kinds of items are debated in the TEC. We have asked for this many times. I know the Council is working on it, but we still have not made good progress. We would like to have a hearing on container security on both sides very soon. This was agreed at our last TEC meeting, but a follow-up will be needed. My last point is: make sure that, on energy-intensive industries, you will bring to the attention of the TEC the idea of identifying a benchmark together. That is the only way the problems in the energy-intensive industries will be solved.

 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner and Mr Vondra, for the Council, for their explanation, but I am certain they felt that there is still some hesitation on our part in giving them our full support. I think it is easy to understand, because we have a very simple case. The difficulty arises because for the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), Parliament will have to give its assent, whereas this is not the case for the Interim Trade Agreement because of our legal obligations. Because of this, when it comes to the Interim Trade Agreement, in our resolution we can only highlight our points and raise our concerns and give support with regard to certain topics; but because of this Parliament, and specifically my political group, is hesitating in giving its full support for the Interim Trade Agreement. I hope this is understandable to you and I hope you can solve the problem. I know that, because of the legal process and, because you have already signed the legal basis, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for you to renegotiate. We are fully aware of the facts, but I am certain you can find some form of commitment and look into further developing and exploring legal bases on which you can help our side to be on your side, because we all recognise how important Turkmenistan is and we have already given support with regard to other agreements. So it is not that we are not fully aware of what has happened and it is not the case that we are not aware how important Turkmenistan is, but it is a very problematic case. I would like you to look into this again and that is why I specifically ask you to do me a favour: look into our paragraph 11, where we raise our concern with regard to the legal obligation and the differences between the Interim Trade Agreement and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Please recognise paragraph 9 of our resolution, which talks about the inclusion of the human rights clause in the PCA agreement. Commissioner, I am aware of and took note of your points, but I am certain there is something you can do to further explore how we can strengthen this particular point. The same is true for paragraph 10, and this is important for the Council as well. We would like to see a revision clause. I know it is not included but, again, please do us a favour, look into it and see what you can do when you continue to negotiate. If you could do something about paragraph 8, this would be more than helpful for us; it relates to monitoring which we always like to have and which we are constantly asking for. Monitoring does not mean that we want to sit at the negotiating table. We have done this under other circumstances, so look at what you can do here, how you can be helpful in defining what monitoring means, but do us a favour and look at the case. By the way, I think you have done great work. All the points are covered in the new EU-Central Asia Partnership Agreement for the 21st century. You even covered the ILO recommendation. You covered human right issues so I am certain we can find a compromise, but a little bit of work still needs to be done.
 Erika Mann, 
 rapporteur

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement with Côte d’Ivoire is one which we now have to vote to accept. We only have the choice of voting yes or no. I hope that, one day, this will change and that Parliament will also be able to participate in the mandate negotiations. That makes it a little more difficult. There are two differences with respect to the Cariforum agreement. First of all, we are dealing with a government that was not democratically elected. Secondly, we are dealing with a provisional agreement, which is initially only to ensure that the old preferences are maintained. The final Agreement will not be negotiated for some time. What I would like to hear from Commissioner Cathy Ashton are assurances on a number of matters which I know will be extremely important for the Côte d’Ivoire. Last weekend, I was again involved in talks from which it became very clear that assurances from the Commission must be forthcoming, which is entirely in agreement with the assurances which the Commissioner provided in the case of the SADC. Please allow me therefore to name some of the most important points. The first point relates to significant flexibility. This flexibility must encompass the following points. Firstly, the inclusion of a review clause, which is also flexible, so that it provides not for a five-year timeframe, but one which can be constantly re-assessed at relatively short notice. Secondly, sensitive matters should be discussed only when the country expressly wishes to do so. In particular, this refers to the Singapore topics, but naturally also to the question of how to integrate TRIPS, as well as similar issues. Thirdly, there is the issue of accepting regional differences when further negotiations take place towards a regional agreement. The Côte d’Ivoire faces a particular problem owing to the fact that the agreement is currently being negotiated and will be signed in isolation, while the aim in the future is to negotiate a regional agreement. Fourthly, it would be important that at any stage during new negotiations it is possible to raise issues that have yet to be addressed at the current stage and that these topics are approved by the Commission. In this context, Commissioner, you only really need to extend the concessions that you already made in the case of SADC to the Côte d’Ivoire. Doing so would increase the likelihood of a corresponding positive response from Parliament. We are simply very concerned, and it is a concern that has been voiced by many non-governmental organisations, that especially in the case of the Côte d’Ivoire the Commission initially appeared to show relatively little flexibility and this was the reason why the aforementioned issues were not taken into account during the transition from the provisional to the full agreement. A concession would therefore prove exceptionally helpful and would enable us to approve the agreement. Moreover, during my discussions with the representatives of the Côte d’Ivoire I understood that they are very concerned that the technical aid will not flow rapidly enough and that here too not all of their concerns have been taken into account. As I understand they are especially interested in the Commission and the international organisations that are providing them with help giving them SME market access so that they can actually make use of the access to the European market. They are exceptionally cautious when negotiations touch on these Singapore topics, when they even discuss them, and are anxious for us to help them develop an understanding of how public goods can be used for society. In addition, they are especially interested in us providing them with help in matters associated with technical standards because for them they often represent real barriers to trade. My final comment refers to the point concerning Parliament. As I mentioned previously, we only have the possibility of saying yes or no, and that obviously imposes relatively significant limitations on the extent to which Parliament is able to collaborate in shaping the vote. I wish to expressly remind you, and you will also find this reflected in our texts, that a possible approval of the provisional agreement does not necessarily mean that we will also automatically vote in favour of the full agreement. In fact, within the framework of the monitoring procedure, we expressly wish to be included in the continuing negotiations so that to a certain extent, in so far as it is within our power, we can follow up on the points that I have just raised. Finally, I would like to ask you to say a few words to tell us to what extent the failed Doha Agreement will have an especially negative impact on the Côte d’Ivoire, especially as far as bananas are concerned.
 Erika Mann,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Council. What you have agreed on today is to give to Côte d’Ivoire what Parliament has been requesting for quite a time and I think the country will be more than happy. Commissioner, please could you make sure that you will send someone – or go yourself – to Côte d’Ivoire as soon as possible to give this very positive message and confirm this by letter as early as possible? This is an agreement which really fulfils what we are asking for. I would like to comment on a few things which you have not really dealt with in detail. We would love to see monitoring. I know that this is complicated and that we will need the Council’s help. We would like to see monitoring between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission taking place during the phase from interim to full agreement. That is the only way we can understand what you are going to negotiate. Otherwise, you will just send us a draft at the end of that period which we will have to agree or disagree with. That is something we do not want to see. We do not want to be part of the negotiating process but we would like to monitor what you are doing. You do not have to do this today – although it would be helpful for us if you could give your agreement today – but I am happy, with my colleague, to negotiate the process with you. We have done this before with different agreements and in different circumstances, but I am sure that – if the Council is willing – we will find something we can agree on. My last point to the Commissioner – and to the Council as well – is to ask for an assurance that that they will do their best to secure the kind of achievements agreed during the Doha Development Round. This was the case regarding bananas and on cotton for other countries. There are other aspects involved which are important for developing countries. I know you cannot say ‘yes’ today, but please give us your assurance that you will try your best to secure those kinds of agreements. My final thanks go to two colleagues, firstly to Glenys Kinnock, because she was more than helpful and I am more than pleased to hear that she recommends assent on the case of Côte d’Ivoire. I know how complicated it is and I am very grateful that she is helping me in this matter. I would also like to thank my colleague Syed Kamall because he also helped as much as he could regarding the resolution. I know that sometimes it is against his beliefs with regard to trade. He is for open trade so it is not easy for him to come to an agreement. That is why I am pleased to thank both colleagues and give my thanks again to the Commission and to the Council.
 Erika Mann,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. – (DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we are having this debate. Of course we have intensive relations with both these countries, but I would like to talk about Mexico in particular. In our debate, we in the Committee on International Trade saw it as particularly important to discuss matters that affect our area. It is especially important to us that we strengthen the free-trade agreement once again. If you look at the figures, you can see that, although our trade has definitely intensified in recent years, there is still considerable demand and that we – and the European side – still have considerable restrictions when it comes to market access. I would sincerely ask you, Commissioner, to again do everything you can to analyse the situation once more together with your competent colleagues and, where problems exist, to really lift these restrictions. It makes no sense whatsoever for us, on the one hand, to talk about strategic partnerships with such important countries in Latin America and then, on the other hand, to still have to battle with such absurd market restrictions. Sometimes, of course, they make sense, but as a rule they are in fact not useful at all. I would be very grateful to you, and to the committee, if we could resolve this matter. The second point that we feel is important is that, in the context of global international relations, we should also truly give Mexico the status it deserves. This, of course, relates in particular to the still very fragile arrangement in connection with the G20. Our delegation has written a letter, which we have also sent to you, in which we ask that Mexico also sit at the G20 table and for this to be a permanent arrangement rather than merely a brief appearance. My final request is for you to attend our delegation meeting on 30 and 31 March; I know that you cannot attend personally, but for you to arrange for someone from your area of competence to attend when Mr Guadarrama, Mr Buganza and Mr Green, who chair the Mexico delegation, come so that they really feel that the Commission values the delegation and its visit.

 Mr President, Mr Karim is absolutely right. The problem is in the very wording, in the fundamentals of Article 20 itself. It is necessary to take account of the reality on the ground. Of course it is. For one thing, not all Member States have consular protection and in many cases what consular protection there is is very limited and the security structures are insufficient even for the consuls themselves. I have personal experience of this in relation to the German consul, who drove through the night in order to gather his colleagues, with his driver but no security, on roads that were by no means safe. Quite simply, such conditions are unacceptable. You cannot go to countries such as India or to Latin American countries – there are many other countries where a presence is required in such a critical place as Mumbai – and then have only a small number of staff and inadequate security structures. Intelligence is not passed on at all, the Member States have no access to the information, and so on. This means that there is no end to the limitations and it is no wonder that Member States are unable to provide the degree of protection for their own citizens or for their officials to anything like the degree they may wish. That is why it is important that the Council and the Commission undertake a careful analysis of this issue. You cannot preach about always being present all over the world and seeing Europe as a global partner and then fail to even have in place a security structure and not be in possession of any intelligent information systems. We are simply opening ourselves up to ridicule if we do not thoroughly analyse our own structures and ensure the requisite level of additional protection. I would thus offer you the urgent advice that you really must carry out a thorough re-evaluation of the structures, that you must carry out simulations, as other States do, and that you must not concentrate solely on the key capitals, the metropolises, but that in these megacountries and megacities you just have to realise that you also need appropriate representation in the other large cities of the world. Mumbai will happen again. There will be another Mumbai, just as past disasters have been repeated. Realise this and, I urge you to be prepared for it.
 Erika Mann  (PSE

 Mr President, I have just a short recommendation to the Council. I appreciate very much what you said, but can you make sure that, once you foresee this kind of simulation today, that you invite some of the people who were actually in Mumbai, because it could give you some insight?

− In this explanation of vote, I would like to congratulate the Fuel Quality Directive rapporteur, Dorette Corbey. She has succeeded in incorporating many demands of this House into the final compromise. The European Union must base its policies and regulations on sound scientific evidence – a requirement both of EU law and the EU’s trade commitments. As a member of the Trade Committee, I often hear from trading partners when the EU appears to be regulating by arbitrary or political processes rather than by reference to scientific conclusions. I was therefore pleased that the revised Fuel Quality Directive did not include an earlier proposal to ban the fuel additive MMT. The revised directive provides for the continued use of MMT, in recognition of the scientific conclusions reached by major trading partners, including the United States and Canada. Importantly, the revised directive also requires the EU to conduct a scientific examination. I strongly believe, and EU and international law require, that restrictions on MMT must be based on science. Because other countries often model their fuel standards on those developed in Europe, it is essential that the EU ensures its fuel regulations are strongly supported by scientific evidence.

 Madam President, I would like to address one issue that until now has not been addressed very often, namely the role of the state. We can see that integration into the global economy also means that we have to increasingly learn that the state has to integrate internationally and globally, so that it is at all capable of interceding and exercising the necessary controls. I think that the European Union has an excellent opportunity to take on this role. We can see that more and more trust is being placed in it. We should do everything we can to show that this trust is justified. This includes the European Union examining its legislation once again. I can see Commissioner McCreevy sitting there. I would advise him with great urgency to approach the Volkswagen Law in a different way to what he has planned. This would be a significant signal that he has understood the sign of the times. I would also like to express my support for Mrs Gräßle. She is absolutely right that we have to be much more stringent with the control measures and I wish that the European Union also understood how to organise itself on an international level. Why not approach the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund with a single voice? It works wonderfully with the World Trade Organization, but we have not learnt how to do this in another sphere. I also hope that you will all give your support to making G20 an organisation that will continue for a long time.

 Madam President, as we know from experience, world trade rounds are very difficult. I would like to thank the Commission because, as we, the Members of the European Parliament, experienced many times in the talks during the last round in Geneva, it conducted itself in a very balanced way right to the very end, and because the Commissioner, in her area of competence, showed not only the necessary flexibility but also great sympathy for the poorer developing countries, and this was constantly pointed out to us in the talks. To that extent, it was not the European Union that was exposed to public scorn this time, but other countries, which were actually much more difficult negotiating partners. I regret that, confronted with the current financial crisis, we find that we need more international and multilateral rules, because these rules form a corset that will make it possible for poorer countries to integrate themselves, on the one hand, while richer countries will also be able to ensure that their people benefit from this, and that standards are set, on the other. What we really regret is that this is apparently the reason why this world trade round cannot be completed by the end of the year. We should rid ourselves of this misconception. Perhaps it is better that way, in that we will tackle all this with the new Parliament and the new Commission and after the elections in the United States, instead of getting it done by any means. My group would recommend caution, rather than bringing this round to a conclusion come hell or high water. Commissioner, I do have one request: however you negotiate and whatever happens, please inform Parliament in good time and make sure, too, that whether we get the Lisbon Treaty or not, we take another look at whether we can perhaps create some kind of ‘quasi Lisbon Treaty’ in advance, relating to the area of trade.

Madam President, I only wish to deal with two points. I should like to begin with an area in which we still have one or two matters to clear up with Pilar del Castillo Vera. I refer to the question of how the independence and autonomy of the future small agency can be guaranteed and which is the most appropriate way to fund it. There are highly diverse views on this point. I would very much like to learn from the Council how its debates on this subject are shaping up, and how the Council would like to see the creation of the secretariat or BERT – or whatever name is adopted – being guaranteed and how it envisages the funding method. In this respect, I believe the Commissioner was perfectly correct in stating that we want a European structure and have no wish to create structures that do not dovetail with the European legal system. There are, as you know, two funding methods under discussion. The first is the mixed financing suggested by the rapporteur and the second is the proposal I made, which my group supports, that we take the funding from the Community budget. Be that as it may, it would be interesting to hear how the Council – which has, of course, had heated discussions on this point – and indeed the national regulators now stand on the funding issue. My second question, which is also addressed to the Council, concerns the funding of the new networks. Here too, we have adopted various amendments, including one I tabled in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which went into a little more detail on the possible form of a risk-sharing system if companies make the requisite investments and competitors are to have access to the networks right from the start. As far as I have heard, the Council thinks differently and does not wish to go into such detail or give companies a guarantee that any kind of risk-sharing can take place. I should be grateful for your comments on these points.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one reason why we wish to have a debate this evening and that is that the attacks from the American side, by both Boeing and many members of Congress, on the awarding of the contract to Northrop Grumman/EADS are very bitter and even go as far as to target individual Member States. That is the reason why we are holding a debate here and why there will also be a resolution, for which I am very thankful, because we in the committee have been trying for a long time to bring this resolution about. The frustration is directed against the fact that Northrop Grumman/EADS presented a better offer, to which the US Air Force gave preference over a Boeing model in a public tender. That is the most natural thing in the world. We are dealing here with NATO partners and not with countries who do not work together regularly. We have the Transatlantic Partnership, which is reaffirmed at every summit meeting. In the three stated areas, Europe purchases four times as much from the Americans, and so, to that extent, we already have a very intensive mutual ‘partnership’. There is absolutely no reason for the Americans to be frustrated, and that is what we want to make clear here. We do not need to go into the details again – I am very grateful that the Commissioner and Mr Papastamkos have already done that. It is essentially a political protest that we want to voice today – and which, by the way, repeatedly influences the WTO discussion on the American side, because comments are constantly being made. The US Air Force cannot be permitted to award a contract to, among others, a European consortium, at the same time as a WTO case is being decided. This makes it plain that the two issues are interwoven politically, but the Commissioner is absolutely right when she points out that, in reality, they are not connected. I should like personally to thank the Commission and the Member States for repeatedly setting great store by getting the facts right. I should also like to thank my fellow Members for the fact that we are finally having this discussion and can present the resolution. I hope this means that the Americans will give us a good hearing.

 Mr President, I should just like to make one very brief point to the Commissioner. The Commissioner rightly mentioned that GSP+ is about sustainable development and it is connected, as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade said, to the Millennium Goals. This is very important and I remember very well, when we discussed this kind of scheme for the first time, that we said we needed to evaluate and re-evaluate how valuable it is for the countries and for ourselves. There is one topic to which I would very much like to draw your attention, which might become a complicated and tricky one in the future, concerning those countries that are operating within the scheme but which have a complicated environment. For example, Sri Lanka, which would love to fulfil the goals, but because of many conditions – and I do not want to go into the details – might not be capable of doing so. I am not arguing that we should change our system. I would just ask the Commission – as my colleague Kader Arif has already done – to be very careful in evaluating each individual case. I would ask you to come back to our committee and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs when you have carried out the evaluation and then please come back to this House, and let us have an evaluation and a discussion on the topic I mentioned.

 Madam President, in our deliberations on the joint motion for a resolution which took place on a cross-party basis on Monday, we forgot that the IMF recommendations on financial crises are already available and that it is now a matter of their implementation. I would therefore recommend – and I very much hope that this will have the support of the House – that the following phrase be inserted in the text:  ‘To the implementation by both parties of the conclusions.’  (DE) 
and then the remainder of the text. There would be no other changes to the text.

 Madam President, I must say, I am startled at what Mr Wojciechowski has just said about Germany, and what a disturbance to the fabric of Europe Germany represents. I have always seen it differently. I find it odd to hear comments like that made here in the European Parliament. Commissioner Verheugen, I believe you addressed the most important points, but there was one thing you did not mention, and that is how difficult the negotiations were this time. It is still very early days for the Transatlantic Economic Council and expectations are, naturally, very high. There is a lot on the ‘to do’ list and I personally believe that healthy realism would be appropriate, because there are some on the team who are simply overloading the Council with too many topics - including psychologically difficult matters such as the poultry issue. My personal recommendation would be to be a little more realistic here, and perhaps to pare down the agenda. Mr Wiersma also pointed out that it is a difficult year politically for the United States. Here in Europe we are also facing a difficult year; in fact, it is already beginning. Many are involved in pre-election campaigns and need to ensure that they will be re-elected and from next year we will have a different Parliament and a different Commission, so it would be good for both sides to cultivate realism so as not to get into difficulty, as has happened so often. We should never forget why we did this. We did it so that we could better understand what the integration of the two markets means – not that we want to integrate them, but that they are in fact already integrated. Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck was right to highlight the figures. What we would still very much like to do – and that was the goal, after all – is to remove the barriers that we can remove. We cannot remove them all. We will just have to live with some of them. We live with barriers within the European market too, not all of which can be removed, yet the world does not fall apart. We need only remove those barriers that we can remove, the ones that are difficult to live with, that are difficult for consumers to live with, the ones whose removal will create more jobs, the ones that are irrational. Some barriers are ridiculous. You have only to visit small businesses; they will tell you that there are some absolutely stupid barriers. Indeed, there are many silly barriers, and those are the ones we should get rid of. I very much hope that the Commission and Parliament will continue to work together in such a committed way. Many problems start in Parliament or have to be dealt with by Parliament. Therefore, thank you very much for the close cooperation, and all the best for a successful next meeting.

I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this explanation of vote to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Ana Maria Gomes. The report being voted on is a very successful one. I would also like to voice my thanks for the fact that numerous aspects of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade have been incorporated into the report. In my view, it is very important to assess China's policy in Africa fairly without generalised condemnation of its engagement there. Instead, the EU's own engagement should be stepped up via the approach centred on 'More Europe in Africa'. This could improve European visibility and achieve a stronger European presence, thereby strengthening the contacts between the EU and Africa. Closer economic ties between the two continents could be of great benefit to both sides.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Gomes, ladies and gentlemen, in the Committee on International Trade we of course focused primarily on aspects relating to trade and economic relations, but in some areas we went beyond that remit. May I therefore comment on two points. First of all, we are very pleased that we have this report, which makes it clear that the European Union has a visible role and commitment in Iraq. We think it is absolutely vital that Iraq be integrated into the trade system and it goes without saying that the WTO is the right arena for that. We will have to provide far more technical assistance than we have done up to now. This technical assistance must focus on moving Iraq towards the European economic system and, to some extent, towards European business. As for funding, we are rather sceptical about the prospect of everything being organised solely via the UN, the World Bank or the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. We would very much like to see own capacity being built up, at least to a certain extent, and own project administration, which would then enable us to build up a store of data and expertise to assist with that effort. We would very much like to see this aspiration being reflected in your decisions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you certainly do not have an easy task. You have one of the most difficult portfolios to deal with. The area of trade/external trade is one which faces completely new challenges. We have been talking about globalisation for years, but I think we are only now beginning to understand what it is about. In your famous speech in Berlin, the Churchill Lecture, you said that Europe is exposed to new challenges and that since the end of the war, the challenges have changed because the frame of reference is no longer Berlin or Paris but Mumbai, Shanghai and the other major cities of the emerging economies. We share your view. You are absolutely right. We see this just as you do. We see the challenges which the European Union must face up to in a new international and global context. China is real. China is not just a myth or an image; China has become a reality to all of us and is a symbol of change. The question is, which conclusions do we draw from this? You conclude that we must change the instruments. You conclude that we must face up to the challenges by adapting the trade defence instruments or other areas. My group has not found the conclusive answer, but we certainly have many more doubts. As you can hear, these doubts are shared in this House. We have doubts because these defence instruments have proved their worth. The defence instruments have a certain flexibility. They can be interpreted in different ways. They can take account of the different industry interests, and they can interpret the Community interest in different ways. The test can be applied in different ways, and no, it is not always perfect. Incidentally, I know that you have not made many mistakes. I myself can identify two points where the evaluation was wrong, but I think that will be the case with new instruments as well. Where are we going then? You say you would like to continue down this road and you would like to continue the consultations. You have not yet closed the drawer. Where should this road take us then? Where should the consultations take us? How would you like to conduct the consultations with this House and with the committee responsible? These are three questions which follow on from what my colleagues have asked. I would be most grateful for some information from you, as I am receiving e-mails every day. Are the changes taking place in your DG an indication that you are pursuing the restructuring with a view to your forthcoming communication? Are the technical changes which are apparently under way in your DG an indicator of this? Can the non-application of the trade defence instruments in 2007 also be interpreted as an indicator, or is it just coincidence, and other factors are in play?

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chatzimarkakis, I was responsible for drafting the relevant report for the INTA Committee. Here we essentially focused on three key aspects. First of all, we called on the Commission to ensure as a matter of urgency, and with due care and diligence, that all recommendations are examined to determine to what extent they impact on the multilateral stage – the so-called Doha Round – and on the bilateral agreements. These bilateral agreements were of special interest to us, as here in the case of Korea. However, we also focused attention on other countries such as India and the ASEAN states. It is important to ensure that market access is only opened up provided that we are also able to have appropriate guarantees from the other side. This relates especially to the so-called non-tariff trade barriers. Secondly, we wish to see greater coordination when it comes to setting international agreements and international standards. Thirdly, we would urgently recommend that when examining internal competition we do not lose sight of international competitive conditions, which have changed considerably in recent years. We now recognise that we have many more international competitors to deal with.

Madam President, I should like to extend my warmest thanks most especially to the rapporteur and the Commission, and of course to the Council too. We have presented a very good report here. We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have given a high priority to producing a practical regulation that will control the international import and export of hazardous chemicals in a reasonable and logical way and that is sufficiently coherent that the importing countries can understand what we in the European Union are trying to achieve. That essentially was the main problem, namely that we had put in some nice things and we had put in some dangerous things but no-one could understand what it actually all meant, all the stuff that we then added in the supplement to the international list. The proposal before us is a good regulation and I hope that it will be understood at international level, so that it can also be properly applied. Things that are not understood will of course not make much sense. This can be just as dangerous; if something is not understood then it will not work no matter what. The Committee on Industry is satisfied and I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for having negotiated with such persistence and common sense that we ultimately achieved a good compromise. I would just request that we do not try to add further to the list immediately but that we test out what is there so that we then actually have a piece of legislation that works.

Mr President, I should like to address three aspects. First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, on behalf of my group. The report has been written with great care and it actually alludes to all the points that are important and have to be debated. It also advises on the appropriate caution to be exercised on certain subjects, e.g. in the automotive sector. In this respect I believe it is an excellent report, which is a good prerequisite and should accordingly be considered by the Commission and the Council. I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner has responded so meticulously to it. Secondly, I should like to ask the Commissioner: how will negotiations with Korea generally proceed, in your view? Negotiations are indeed underway and are at a very difficult stage. It seemed very much better at the beginning, I believe, than we have thought in the meantime. Parallel negotiations with all the ASEAN nations are also being added, of course. These negotiations are also – as far as I have gathered from the Minutes – at a very difficult stage. What is the Commission’s assessment of this? What influence will our ongoing negotiations with ASEAN have on negotiations with Korea? My last question to the Commissioner relates to the fact that the Heads of State or Government are just about to sign the Reform Treaty today, 13 December. Under this Reform Treaty, Parliament will in future have a great deal more influence in the retail sector, for which we in this Parliament have been fighting for a very long time. I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Mandelson in particular for always having backed this. My question, however, is this: can you imagine that the Commission will support us when we ask the Council for the right that has already been brought forward under the upcoming free trade agreement and that Parliament will therefore keep the relevant endorsement obligation? Can we assume that we have you on our side in this, Commissioner?
 Erika Mann  (PSE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that what will be important is to use the next few weeks to shape the agreement so that everyone can be happy with it. It is an agreement of great importance and it has immense symbolic resonance. It is not just about negotiating a free trade agreement for the regions and countries of Africa and bringing them closer to Europe. It is also about producing an agreement for a real development round, which fights poverty and genuinely shows that the European Union is in a position to negotiate an agreement in a way which puts the African countries at their ease and helps them feel a bond with the European Union. There are several points which are important, as you yourself said, and you mentioned a number of them. We must ensure that the regional agreements genuinely benefit the countries concerned. We must ensure that the non-LCD countries also get an agreement and are not left out, and we must ensure that all the countries can develop in the right direction. The agreement which you proposed, in the form of a two-step approach, must also guarantee that no one is left out, so that ultimately, we are genuinely moving in the right direction, which is still not guaranteed today. Mr Markov, we should utilise the opportunity available to us now as a result of not adopting the resolution tomorrow, in order to reach a consensus in Parliament, and I think we have enough points of convergence for that to happen.

As you know, the European Union is currently defending Airbus in a case before the WTO brought by the United States on behalf of Boeing. I believe it is important at this stage of the dispute for this body to build support for the European Union’s position and against that of the United States. I should state at the outset that this entire dispute arose because Boeing no longer wished to participate in a mutually-agreed international agreement between the United States and the European Union – an agreement that allowed certain forms of government support to both Airbus and Boeing, the only two producers of large civil aircraft in the world. As my colleagues know, such agreements are the best foundation upon which relations among nations are based. It is incumbent on nations to abide by their obligations under these treaties. Airbus has. The European Union has. Unfortunately, the United States has not. Airbus and the European Union have constantly abided by the spirit and intent of the 1992 Bilateral Aircraft Agreement. For 11 years, competition between Airbus and Boeing flourished, resulting in important breakthroughs in commercial aviation technology and design that have led to safer, more efficient and more environmentally-sensitive air travel. But Boeing decided it no longer wanted to abide by the obligations of this agreement. Instead, with the assistance of the United States, they attacked Airbus for exacting so-called ‘illegal subsidies’ – the very government assistance that Boeing had originally agreed to in the 1992 agreement. As many of my colleagues are aware, Airbus’s government loan funding is a targeted and non-trade-distorting use of a government’s limited research resources. It offers governments a fair return and brings to the market innovative products, which benefit everyone. Simply stated, European government research and development funding is limited, repayable and has no impact on Boeing’s ability to compete. Meanwhile, because Boeing produces both civil and military aircraft for the United States, technology used in its commercial aircraft today benefits greatly from US government awards to Boeing military research and development contracts. For example, Boeing’s current knowledge about composites, which is being used extensively in its new 787 Dreamliner, stems – by its own admission – from its work on developing the V-22, the F-22, the B-2 and the Joint Strike Fighter. This federal assistance is supplanted by US state and local government support to Boeing in the form of tax breaks, favourable real estate and local infrastructure improvements intended to secure the company’s presence and job base in selected US cities. While Boeing opposes the Airbus repayable assistance programme, it has no problem with identical programmes benefiting Boeing in Japan. I highlight these points not to imply that the assistance received by Boeing (repayable in Japan but not in the US) is somehow worse than the repayable European loans received by Airbus. I mention this assistance that Boeing receives to illustrate the reality that both sides benefit from some form of government assistance, from nations wishing to retain their global leadership roles in aviation. While Boeing has benefited from government support, it seeks to deny Europe similar benefits. I believe we should urge the Commission to direct Airbus and Boeing to develop a forward-looking arrangement that provides a stable environment for both sides to compete and develop state-of-the-art aircraft well into the future. Maybe a six-month moratorium on the WTO case would allow the two companies time to complete a new discipline. This is the opportunity that is now before us. We can dwell on the past or look forward to the future.

 I voted against Mr Davies’ report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2
 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles. Having initially voted in favour of the report in the direct voting in plenary, I then withdrew my vote in writing, as noted in the parliamentary records of 25 October 2007. In my view, the report is extremely arbitrary and fails to take appropriate account of the needs of Germany’s automobile industry or environmental concerns. For example, the report does not differentiate between the various weight classes of vehicles and therefore makes unrealistic demands of car manufacturers. As regards advertising, an increasing comparison is made between labelling needs for tobacco products and vehicles. The rapporteur (Mr Davies, an English Green Liberal) was only prepared to compromise on one point at the very end of the process during the deliberations on his report. This was much too late to formulate a sensible recommendation from Parliament which could have secured the support of all the groups.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing tonight and will be voting on tomorrow will be a small but important building block in the cooperation between the institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. In this procedure, Parliament's only options are to agree with the proposal or reject it. The way that Mr Susta, the rapporteur, and all the shadow rapporteurs – and here I would like to thank particularly Kader Arif from my group – have handled it increased considerably the predefined scope for Parliament to take action. However, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for expressly pointing out that this accord, this Protocol, which we will vote on tomorrow and which Member States will then be able to ratify, is only a building block – an important one, but only a building block – and that there are many more steps to be taken to give developing countries with no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector a real opportunity, which they need, to provide their citizens with essential medicines. This step will help us in our cooperation and it will especially help us when Parliament gains further rights of consent in the many other policy areas, in the area of trade, for example. I extend sincere thanks to the Council and the Commission and all the Members who made it possible actually to achieve the flexibility that we now have.

The report by Mr Raül Romeva i Rueda on the murder of women in Central America and Mexico and the European Union’s role in preventing this is a well balanced report. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and his engagement. He led the negotiations in a very sensitive and positive political style. I would also like to thank him for the attention he devoted to this topic. Human rights enjoy a high-ranking importance in the European Union. Luckily, between the EU and Mexico, human rights topics play an important role; as part of the Free Trade Agreement they even have a kind of formal character and they also play a crucial role in our Joint Parliamentary Delegation, which I have the pleasure to chair and which is now chaired on the Mexican side by Senator José Guadarrama Márquez.

In my view, the decision to retain the idea of an EIT is a mistake. None of the arguments presented is convincing as they start from false premises. 1. Even the original idea put forward by Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, to launch the EIT as a European response to America's MIT ignored reality, and the proposal presented for the vote today further worsens the original concept. MIT evolved with a great deal of money and diverse support, and in Europe numerous 'mini-MITs' are already carrying out world-class research. Europe's dilemma is the inadequate financial and moral support for innovation and top-class research. 2. The proposed EUR 309 million in funding from a reserve budgetary source blocks other parliamentary initiatives such as the strategically important Galileo project. The funding proposal amounts to just an eighth of the estimated budget and therefore does not offer any incentive for serious additional private initiatives. BP has invested USD 500 million in the biofuels sector in Berkeley in the United States alone. 3) With its own generous sources of funding and grants to the top-class European institutes already in existence, the EIT would have a prospect of success. For example, the EU could follow the Canadian model and set up an innovation fund financed from monies left in the EU budget at the end of the year. 4. The planned network infrastructure is a virtual supranational institution without any real significance in the European and international research landscape. It is an unhappy and bureaucratic compromise. I have therefore voted against the proposal.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have been enjoying myself inserting ‘toys’ and ‘China’ into Google. I would recommend you all do this, too. You will then get entire lists of suppliers, the Chinese supply industry and producers and see all that you can buy there. 80% of the toys from China end up on the Commission’s website and vice-versa. The European market imports 80% of its toys from China. If you look at these two figures together, you can imagine the scope of what we are dealing with here. Of course, you have to see that on the one hand we are now in a context internationally where the world economy is becoming interlinked and European industry and jobs are naturally dependent on supplies from China. On the other hand, it must also be said that world-wide networking of this kind in industry only works when there is trust. This trust is based on certain aspects that also have to be maintained. Trust grows when there is fair competition. Fair competition is achieved when there is assurance from the Chinese, and also from the producers and the supply industry, that they are actually able, and have the know-how, to carry out all the necessary checks for exporting their products to Europe according to the criteria of the European market. However, trust grows, of course, and fair competition can be generated only when the producers, and specifically the Chinese government in this case, guarantee that the environmental, social and worker standards that we have will also be gradually introduced to the same extent by the Chinese, as otherwise we shall have conditions of unfair competition. Unfair competition always has an impact on this country’s ability to make checks. We can see this because all the data show that most of the problems we have with dangerous toys from China do not necessarily come from producers of the major brands, but from those who are involved in unsafe supply chains. This monitoring operation therefore needs to be considerably developed by the Chinese. Honourable Commissioners, we too must put our house in order, of course, and I believe much still lies in disarray in Europe. I would not like to repeat what my fellow Members have already addressed, but instead list a few points concerning the Committee on International Trade and particularly the responsibility of European importers to introduce border checks and the need to initiate legal product recall campaigns and the issue of when to resort to import bans and import restrictions as a whole and under what conditions. We will soon be having difficulty – at least in certain sectors, such as the textile sector – as the safeguards we currently have are expiring. We shall then have additional problems at least in that sector.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we on the INTA Committee requested this debate because we are very concerned as we see that we are concluding more and more agreements of different kinds which affect all our work in the external economic sector and which also, of course, always have a foreign policy component. We have bilateral free trade agreements, regional free trade agreements, partnership agreements and strategic agreements and we worry about how these can be brought together so that we have a consistent European approach for responding to the challenges of globalisation in the foreign policy and external economic sector. Commissioner, you have rightly said that Brazil is an important country for us. I am also very grateful that the President-in-Office of the Council is present, and we all, of course, share this opinion. It is not just an important country; it is in many respects also a fantastic country. The question simply is: how can we sensibly combine this strategic agreement with, at the same time, the idea of concluding a regional agreement with Mercosur, which has got itself into very troubled waters? It is simply not true that we get along wonderfully in the negotiations. It is very complicated. Alongside this we want to conclude a multilateral agreement in the Doha Round. It does not seem at all likely that we will be able to bring this agreement off as a crowning achievement, if we can bring it off at all. So how do you want to bring all this together at the same time? That is our question. Of course, it is also a strategic agreement. What is the nature of a strategic agreement? It contains a great deal if you look at it. There are very many political declarations of intent on Brazil and all of them very sensible. Again, in my Group we are very happy that they are also included, but how do you want to link this to the other members, e.g. in Latin America, with whom we have free trade agreements? Or how do you want to feed this back again so that our trade policy is imbued with a uniform European policy in such a way that all partners can understand this too?

 Mr President, rapporteur, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me raise a few points. I found Commissioner Kroes’s commentary most fascinating; I am sure that what she said was all agreed with you. I have some questions in this regard. The Commissioner mentioned that it will be possible to consider drawing funding from the European Regional Development Fund for the promotion of broadband. I should like her to tell me how she envisages that this will take place. Will it be the subject of a communication? What will the criteria be? How is it to be announced? What procedure will be followed? Will it come under traditional State aid, according to the current definition, or does she envisage a special communication in this regard? If a special communication is issued, what will be the procedure for agreeing this? How does she plan to verify that these enterprises are really installing broadband capabilities in accordance with the competition rules and not simply producing a costing and saying, ‘That is a great idea, and we would like to help ourselves to this aid in all regions that are ‘uncompetitive’, as it were’? I would be grateful if the Commissioner would explain this once more. There was a second comment from the Commissioner’s colleague, who mentioned that the Commissioner is contemplating a Green Paper dealing with public services in this field, which may, among other things, include broadband. I have some questions about this, too. When does she plan to issue this Green Paper and what kind of consultation procedure will be applied? When will she be bringing the consultation procedure to public attention? My final question is as follows. Can she perhaps provide an overview of the extent to which financial support is already being provided to the field of broadband development from the structural and regional programmes? If I am not mistaken, this is already taking place. I would be grateful if she could provide me with written information on this – it does not have to be today.

 Madam President, we are discussing Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl’s report at a very difficult time. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia is virtually on ice. There are difficult relations between certain Member States and Russia. It is totally unclear what the outcome of the WTO negotiations will be. In this regard, too, there is frustration on many counts. The Free Trade Agreement that should be concluded after Russia’s accession to the WTO is a project that we have been envisaging for a long time but has been put off time and again. Mr Wiersma and also Mrs Oomen-Ruijten raised an important point, and that is that we are in a strange situation. On the one hand, we are achieving economic integration and are sensing in the Russians an intensity and indeed a willingness to adopt Western standards in the field of investments and production facilities. On the other hand, in the political sphere, something is discernible on the part of Russia that could be described as either uncertainty or a craving for status. It is good to retain a healthy pragmatism, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has done in her report, and to say that we need and want these relations. Russia is our neighbour, it is an important political power, and it will continue to be an important political power in future. We also need it for the internal stability of the European region as a whole. Let us develop sound economic relations, therefore, including in the field of energy cooperation. I believe that this is the right course to take. Yet we need something more, too, Commissioner, so that there is not always the risk of Russia’s using economic policy as a political weapon. We should develop sound mechanisms to foster genuine dialogue. These are finely tuned in relation to many other countries, in some cases very finely tuned, but in the case of Russia we are still at square one. Dialogue between our respective business communities, SMEs, political cooperation, civil society – all this is necessary for the development of a reliable democracy that does not fear that every conflict situation will immediately turn into a dispute.

 Madam President, I would like to address a number of points relating to Mr Caspary’s report and to the Commission proposal that are of importance to my group. I would very much like to thank the Commissioner for being courageous enough to raise these issues in the first place and for proposing that the European Union change its strategy, something that this House had called for back in 2002, when it was I who proposed that we look more to Asia where agreements are concerned, so you have my heartfelt thanks for that. The problem is, though, that the global economy has been undergoing fundamental changes since 2002. Along with China, other players have entered the game, and the proposed countries – Korea, for example, and some ASEAN states, along with India – are no longer developing countries in the traditional sense of the word, but already have emergent economies and have become extremely competitive, yet, within some of them, great poverty predominates, which presents the European Union with challenges, and that means that we will have to follow through with a well-thought out strategy that promotes fairness in trade with these countries. We will have to strike a balance by, on the one hand, taking decisions on the opening up of markets together with the countries concerned and on a case-by-case basis, while also, of course, insisting on standards in the areas of environmental protection and safety in the workplace, and also, of course, in that of intellectual property. Achieving that balance will be a difficult business. You said, Commissioner, that you had already accorded Parliament more rights by entrusting it with the decision on the mandate. That is indeed so, and I would like to express my gratitude for it, but I would nevertheless ask you for your continued support as we demand of the Council that we should, in future, be granted the right of assent, which will be a considerable help in developing a proper trade policy. I would like to thank Mr Caspary and my colleague Mrs Ferreira, who acted as shadow rapporteur, for the report itself and for their willingness to cooperate with us.

 Mr President, I would just like to address a few aspects of relevance to the idea of the trans-Atlantic market. One gets the recurrent impression, when listening to Members of this House, that relations between Europe and the United States are remarkably tense, with the expectations of it evoking permanent frustration on one side and constant enthusiasm on the other, and that is no sound basis for a relationship; what we need is healthy realism, and so I should like to congratulate the German Presidency of the Council on having taken up the idea of the trans-Atlantic market, which this House had set out in numerous resolutions and, over many years, done a great deal of work on with the Americans, and also, of course, with many Council Presidencies and the Commission, and I would like to thank all those who were involved in this work. It is this healthy realism that we will need in future, together with a model, a regulatory environment, in which economic cooperation between both sides can be enhanced, in which they can work together more and look together to the future, but the object of this is not coherence; rather, it is that the two economic areas and societies continue to develop along autarkic lines. The future will bring disputes between us, but that is part and parcel of our not being a single economic area, but having differences in many areas. What we need, though, is this healthy pragmatism, and I hope that the future Presidencies of the Council and the Commission will all roll their sleeves up and put some effort into cultivating it in many areas. It is also clear that this is not just about the economy; this model has received repeated endorsement in many dialogues on subjects ranging from consumer protection to trade unions, and it is broadly supported across society. I would also argue that it is only reasonable that Members of this House be involved in the work of cooperation, and, indeed, that this is indispensable if a model fit for the future is to be developed. I do not believe that there is any basis for the concern voiced by some Members that the developing countries could be harmed by this; that is nonsensical, because, on the contrary, we will, through cooperation, be helping them rather than dividing them.

 Madam President, I shall examine just a few of the points discussed in the Committee on International Trade. Having visited both parts of Kosovo several times myself – both Priština and Mitrovica – I am in a relatively good position to assess the situation. Our particular concern is that there be a very detailed analysis of the economic and commercial situation, as we believe that economic stability is the only way to achieve long-term security in the region as a whole. The situation is extremely problematic. The infrastructures are very weak; key industries are in need of complete modernisation and renovation. There are SMEs that are very innovative but require a great deal more financial support, and there is a very young population that must be integrated and needs jobs. All of this is possible only within the framework of integration into the EU – not integration in the sense that we are appealing immediately for Kosovo’s membership of the EU, but in the sense that we fully develop the concept of free trade areas, in particular, into one that really works. After all, agreements have already been signed with many of the Balkan countries; but these must really be functional. We also strongly advocate that the excellent work the EU has done to date in the field of the fourth pillar, in particular, be carried over to the new structures, so that the systems do not require complete renewal.

 Madam President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair. What is interesting and fascinating about this debate is that we are talking about a plurilateral agreement that is very specific in character. It is, of course, part of the multilateral framework but, as it is plurilateral in character, it allows much more flexibility for those Member States that are part of this agreement. With regard to this, and as it is its tenth anniversary, could the Commissioner tell us a little bit about it: how it worked in the past, whether he is satisfied with it and thinks it is a worthwhile undertaking that is worth renegotiating. It is not part of his portfolio, but does he consider that it is also worthwhile renegotiating the telecoms agreement, which is also ten years old this year? With regard to the agreement on government procurement – which Mr Audy mentioned – we are very concerned about SMEs, because we know by experience that they are definitely having much more difficulty in accessing international markets. What is the Commission going to do about it beyond what has been done in the past? China is of great concern. We are happy to have China as part of the global environment, but it puts a lot of pressure on some companies. So once China becomes a member of the plurilateral agreement, what safeguards will the Commissioner put in place to safeguard the interests of European companies and workers? How much is this exercise part of global Europe? How much is it related to the new approach from the Commission agreeing on different bilateral agreements and what will be part of this connection? With regard to services of general interest, how, again, will the Commissioner ensure that European interests will be safeguarded? Can the Commissioner tell us more about that? He has not touched on that. Finally, can the Commissioner ensure that Parliament will be kept informed? Can he promise that the Committee on International Trade, which has just elected its new chairman this morning, will also be kept informed?

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are having this joint debate, since we will end up, in future, with a shared legal basis differentiating between developing countries and richer, industrialised nations, and so it is good that we should be discussing this today. Mr Martin, the rapporteur, was right to point out that we have to seek after a more logical and systematic approach when it comes to defending the European Union’s interests in our cooperative efforts with others, and I am glad that the Commission treated with respect his argument that further differentiation is needed, along with consideration of the countries' specific interests, more evaluation, and an early review. I would like to add a couple of other points, which Mr Papastamkos has already addressed. When this review is carried out, this differentiation must be reflected even more logically in our dealings on the foreign policy and trade policy fronts. What I mean by that is that we currently maintain very intensive relations with certain countries, with free trade agreements and partnership agreements, but the thinking on the basis of which we cooperate using financial instruments is not always in line with our thinking about policy. It follows that we should strive after greater strategic depth in financial cooperation too, for there is no point in having free trade agreements – with Mexico or Chile, for example – and having more of their kind in mind for the future, while not being logical in our cooperation; it is just as illogical to deny the least developed countries more intensive support than that given to those that are already on their way up and can be described as emerging. It is in just this way that we need to become more specific in future, and I might add that that also involves Parliament being consulted not only on the financial instruments as part of the codecision procedure, but also as soon as dialogue towards the conclusion of bilateral agreements is embarked on, and that its agreement shall be an indispensable requirement, for this House’s involvement will otherwise result only, in the final analysis, in a wedge being driven between the Commission and the Member States, and that will make full and democratic support quite simply impossible. I would like to ask the Commissioner, as a matter of urgency, to stress, in the debates involving the Commission and the Member States, the necessity of Parliament’s approval being given in all areas, so that our system of values – about which we talk unceasingly – may remain intact not only when we talk about other countries, but also when we make policy for ourselves.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, and also thank the rapporteur for this excellent report, which touches on all the issues that are relevant when talking about India. The Commissioner mentioned one specific point to which I think we should give in-depth consideration, and that is that India might finally become a geopolitical centre in the 21st century. I think he is right about that and the European Union and the Commission will have to make up their minds. You cannot say ‘either India or China’; that is not the right approach. But we will certainly have to focus, because to deal with both countries and many more countries to come as regards bilateral agreements might be something that is impossible for the Commission whilst making sure that the multilateral round flourishes. So I would like to point out to the rapporteur and the House that my Group will be a little more cautious when it comes to a free-trade agreement. We are not against a free-trade agreement; quite the opposite. We already argued in favour of a free-trade agreement and regional agreement in 2002, when I presented my own report to this House, but I think we should first have an in-depth debate and discussion on the issue. The Commission will produce its new policy report on 4 October, in only a few weeks. So we will not support a free-trade agreement at the moment, because we want to have a debate in our Group first and we want to be clear that Parliament will be fully involved in the debate and the consultation process. It is important and relevant to see a shift from the multilateral to the more bilateral agreement and to make sure that there is some coherence when it comes to trade policy. That is one of the reasons why tomorrow we are not going to support the idea of a free-trade agreement at this stage. I am happy also that Mr Karim touched on the various high-tech issues. I think it is absolutely essential that we focus more on India and cooperate more closely with it. Now, everything I said is not on behalf of Glyn Ford, who is the shadow rapporteur. He apologises to Mr Karim for not being here. He has to go back to England, but he will certainly follow up the issues and discuss them in detail.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have had the pleasure of sitting in this House and following the progress of trade policy for twelve years, in the course of which I have seen three Commissioners deal with the subject, and I know how difficult it is. This House has been there through every twist and turn of the negotiations; it has seen how difficult it is to conduct them on a multilateral basis, and how difficult it is, too, to understand what is meant by a modern trade policy and trade strategy. Speaking personally, I am highly sceptical as to whether we have a right understanding of it even now. I can go along with much of what you have said just now, and I am grateful to you for referring to the Commission’s new communication, ‘Global Europe: Competing in the World’, 
which will be reaching us shortly. Sometimes, though, I take a rather sceptical view of our own self-criticism and our understanding of the changes that have come about in the world. On the one hand, it is certainly easy to criticise the Americans – and there is no shortage of reasons for doing it – but it is also important that it be mentioned that there is, in developing countries too – Brazil being one of them – and for reasons that Members have already addressed, scepticism about agreeing with the WTO. Another factor may well be that China has become a global trading partner, with a greater impact on countries like Mexico, to name but one, than it has in the EU or the United States. There are so many reasons, and I sometimes find it regrettable that the debate on a modern trade policy, to which you yourself refer in your own document, is not engaged in at the necessary depth. What is also lacking is an understanding of the fact that the EU’s Member States have taken up very different positions as regards the challenges of globalisation. Some of our countries are very open, because they can afford to be, while some, however, are in difficulties because they got around only very late to introducing reforms and transforming themselves. This is evident from the textiles debate and from the anti-dumping debate with reference to shoes, and there are many other examples. I quite simply do not see us actually thinking through what we mean by modern trade policy. That involves – as I have mentioned – the part played by China. Have we really understood what China’s accession to the WTO means? If you are going to consider the possibility of Russia joining it there, Commissioner, then we urge you to discuss the matter with us; the lack of any debate about the effects and consequences of that is something I find regrettable, and, for that reason, I am in favour of having one. It is something for which this House expressed its support as long ago as 2002, at the same time as it declared itself in favour of negotiations with Asia, and yet, as I see it, the debate with this House and with the responsible committee is lacking in depth. I would like to see a debate about what our participation in the GATS+ negotiations forming part of the bilateral round might mean; here, too, you are right, but I do wish we could have a debate about it. What I do think needs to be done if we are to talk in terms of a modern trade policy is for this House to be fully consulted, not just when we are called upon to agree to the outcomes of negotiations, but at the outset, when such negotiations are being considered. The Commission, the Council, and this House, meeting in Stuttgart, have already negotiated a statement, and that involved this House being consulted either fully or to a considerable degree. I would recommend to you that we do the same thing again, and hope that you can agree to this.

 Mr President, I should like to discuss a point to which the Commissioner referred: he expressed the hope that the Research Framework Programme would bring the Lisbon Agenda to the fore once again. I think he is absolutely right. Indeed, the advantage of the European Research Framework Programme and of the European research area is firstly that we can define our research identity in the European Union, and secondly that we can be part of international developments. Overall, these programmes are of course promoting the competitiveness of the European Union. There are currently quite a lot of difficulties regarding the issue of stem cell research. Some Members are attempting, in effect, to renationalise this area, whenever it is a matter of critical research. I think that is highly problematic. This kind of renationalisation would affect many areas of research in future, such as nuclear research, security research and many other areas where certain nation states have ethical or other concerns. I do not think we should do that. This kind of renationalisation would be highly damaging not only to the Lisbon Agenda but also to the European Union as a whole in future. I therefore hope that we will reach broad consensus on the Research Framework Programme. Congratulations to Mr Buzek, to our shadow rapporteurs and to Mr Busquin.

 Mr President, at this point, the voting order suggests that we should vote on Amendment 18 first and then on paragraph 7, and do it in four parts. What we need to do here is, first to vote on Amendment 18, which is compatible with the proposal for split votes, while keeping things in the right order. I would, however, propose that we ignore the vote on Part 1, which is identical with 2, 3 and 4, apart from the difference that split votes have been proposed for 2, 3 and 4 and that Part 1 proposes that 2, 3 and 4 be voted on together. I would also make so bold as to add something. The proposal for a split vote on Parts 2, 3 and 4 refers only to the amendments to the English version and not to the versions in other languages. I hope that makes sense. (General laughter)

 Madam President, greetings to all my fellow Members and, of course, to the Commission and the Council. As so often, I have the great pleasure of preparing the accompanying report on behalf of the Committee on International Trade and, in this, I am concentrating more on foreign trade and economic themes. As in the past, I also share the views of my fellow Member, Mr Brok. Like many of our fellow Members, we have worked together for many years, and we have also always received the considerable support of this House, for which I should expressly like to thank you. If we look at business and trade relations, then my report essentially contains one key idea. The Commission does, of course, share the view that we should proceed on the basis of how things really are. We already have a transatlantic market. It exists. It is just that we are often scarcely aware of it. We always talk about all the things we have to do, and we always focus completely on the trade barriers that exist. It is these trade barriers too with which the press concerns itself on a daily basis, but what frequently we no longer see at all are the positive things we have achieved. What this report says, therefore, is: let us for once just be aware of the way things really are. How much trade really goes on between the European Union and the United States? What investments take place? Another thing: what is the volume of trade done by enterprises established in both Europe and the United States? As can be seen, the figure is huge. I do not want to bore you now with it, but it is astronomical. The number of jobs that depend on such trade is really extremely high. The figure for those that we know about on each side of the Atlantic – and there are very many more, because there is a lot of data we have not obtained – in itself amounts to EUR 7 million. Here is an example that I come up with again and again: that of our famous flagship, Airbus, on the European side and of Boeing on the American side. We are always so proud, with Europeans and Americans each believing the one to be a purely European business and the other a purely American one. Yet that is not the case. The two companies are 40% dependent on each other. This provides you with a good example. Go to MTU. I have had the great pleasure of looking at the operation in my own constituency. When, for example, repairs are being carried out – with the work benches, as it were, running parallel – you can see Airbus and Boeing planes each in their turn, now one and now the other. That is only one example, however. Building on an awareness of how things really are and proceeding on the basis of the New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 and of the economic agenda that we have had since 1998, which has been upheld at all the summits, in all the decisions of the European Parliament and in the Commission’s work programme and which was upheld and confirmed in the legislative dialogue that took place a couple of weeks ago in Vienna between our fellow Members and the Americans, we should therefore take a further step – not an earth-shattering step, but just a small one – and say: let us at long last remove the barriers that are causing problems. This is not, as many people outside believe, about removing barriers to create a free-trade zone – ATTAC has been stirring things up a bit in this case – but about removing technical barriers, as we have been doing for many years. In that way, we stick to our standards and to our precautionary principle, and we continue to maintain the rules of the internal market. The EU’s and the Member States’ sovereignty is not encroached upon. Nor is this a naïve proposal because we know that there will, of course, be further trade disputes. That is only natural and to be expected. What we have here are the two largest trade blocks. Obviously, there is a clash of interests. That is also the way it should be. The fact is, we have disputes in the EU too, but they do not send us into a panic every time they happen. Disputes are normal. Some of them we can solve within the framework of the world trade round. Many of them we cannot solve. The Hamon dispute is one that we have not been able to solve for many years, and we are paying for the fact. There are also problems on the American side. For example, the Americans have difficulty recognising non-pasteurised milk, which they see as a health problem. So what about their precautionary principle? All right, that is just the way things are. Let us live with the situation. There are, however, many other barriers that we should remove. In this report, I am asking that we do just that. There is a point about which I still need, in a moment, to say something. I should expressly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee, all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, the Commission which, as always, has worked excellently with me and all my colleagues, and, also of course, the Council, the NGOs, the think tanks, the trade unions, the companies and those otherwise involved, as well as my own group. Some parts of my own group – I am referring to the group of the Greens – have some problems with the term ‘barrier-free’, because it always sounds as if it refers to a free-trade area. Hence, my proposal for tomorrow concerning split voting. I would propose that we simply remove such concepts and the figures referred to in connection with them. I hope that I shall obtain the House’s support in this connection. We can then all breathe a sigh of relief, and we shall have a sound basis on which to proceed. I hope that we shall then also obtain the House’s full support. Madam President, I know that you are nervous. Nonetheless, just two more points I have to mention. In the case of bioethanol, I should like to introduce a verbal addition. I forgot to include bioethanol and biodiesel. Therefore, I shall say tomorrow: and diesel. On this subject, too, I hope that I shall obtain your support. And that, in theory, is everything. Thank you.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of points I would like to make. Firstly, of course, I have to thank Mr Papastamkos, but I would like to include in that expression of gratitude Mr Moreno Sánchez, a member of my own group and its shadow rapporteur. Both of them, along with all the other Members who have acted as shadow coordinators, have done excellent work in achieving – to some extent jointly – a good compromise and a credible report. I have a couple of important points to make, which relate to the aspects that you, Commissioner, addressed. We find ourselves in a very tricky situation. London was not a success, Rio was not a success, and next comes Geneva. Are you ready and able to say something about the prospects for these negotiations? Will Geneva happen? How will it work out? A second point that we have raised with the Commissioner several times already is whether the Commission will, this time, be willing to acknowledge, in the final statement, the role of parliaments. There is recognition already for civil society, but the role of parliaments is still passed over in silence. Only if it is mentioned will it be possible to give better guarantees, in future, of the parliaments’ involvement and of their ability to exercise a monitoring function.

 Mr President, I have one short question concerning the point the Commissioner just raised, that the April meeting will be a general Council meeting. According to the information I have received, the general Council meeting might be changed – if it is successful – to a ministerial meeting. In that case, the usual practice is that we have politicians available. Could you please evaluate with your fellow Commissioners, and with Commissioner Mandelson, how you would like to proceed in such a case.
 Erika Mann,

 Mr President, I have a few questions and I will not be able to speak on behalf of my group in this case because, as with the anti-dumping cases, I think we are pretty much divided and have our own views on this issue. Nevertheless, I want to thank the Commissioner for presenting his point of view and for intervening. My starting point is that the anti-dumping measures and instruments need to be taken quite seriously. On that point, I support my colleague Mr Sturdy, who is right. If we do not use the instrument in a transparent and fair way it could become quite complicated for us. My first question to the Commissioner is: will the EU produce an overall assessment of the conditions of competition and state intervention in the People’s Republic of China? The European Parliament would also like to receive a report on China’s compliance with WTO rules and accession commitment five years after its accession to the WTO. Would the EC take WTO action if China and Vietnam do not stop their unfair actions within a reasonable period of time and what would these measures be? Commissioner, do you agree that the EC agreement and the results of the AD investigations are confidential and that leaks of information may lead to market distortions? Could you explain in detail the rationale behind the exclusion of children’s footwear, especially in view of the fact that in some countries children’s footwear is worn by adults? Could you explain why the publication of the results of the anti-surveillance system were so delayed? If I am not completely mistaken, it was one year. One small point: how do you see this investigation relating to another evaluation which is currently being undertaken as regards giving China market economy status?
 Erika Mann (PSE

 Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he could make a short comment on a question raised by many of our colleagues on granting market economy status to China.
 Erika Mann (PSE

(DE)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take as my starting point the point just made by Mr Sturdy. You, Commissioner, asked what you should do in terms of ongoing evaluation, and what we would like you to consider. Mr Sturdy is, I think, right; we certainly should give consideration in future to whether the single undertaking approach will always be the right one. Its continued use probably makes sense, but I strongly suspect that the future of the WTO will depend on other methods being found, on a more flexible outlook that will probably involve allowing issues to be negotiated in parallel and the use of a flexible and rolling work plan. How all that will fit into this round is something I leave to you and your wisdom. Following on from this is another consideration that you should bear in mind. This House has always maintained – indeed, I myself drafted a report on the subject some years ago – that we should take note of the bilateral rounds too. My own group consistently attaches a great deal of importance to the multilateral negotiating round and I am very much in favour of it, but it must nevertheless be clear to us that bilateral negotiations are of value too. Now for my question: while the old Commission always refused to enter into bilateral agreements with Asia, have you, Commissioner, come to see things differently? Would you like to set other priorities for work in this area? Thirdly, I have just returned from Mexico, where, I was surprised to learn, a high degree of importance is attached to the services sector and to investments in infrastructure, although I did get the impression that there was no very precise understanding of what the Commission would like to do and of what we would like to do in the multilateral rounds on services. Perhaps you could find something to say about that. My fourth point has to do with standards. I am firmly persuaded of the need for us to get back to discussing standards in the multilateral round more than anywhere else. The more participants, the more important that will become. The more problematic international competition becomes, the more pressing an issue this will be. What I would like to know is whether you are thinking in terms of a new initiative. Finally, framework programmes for research are under discussion, and many Members have raised one point that will become important where agriculture is concerned. Where do you stand on the question as to whether we should invest more in agricultural and structural research? What line do you take on research into bioethanol?

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there are just a few points I would like to address, but, before I do so, I would like to congratulate you on having put before us such a sound negotiating package. Both of you have rightly highlighted the need for our trading partners to move forward, and for them to do so to varying extents. Commissioner Mandelson pointed out that the United States’ agriculture offer was very late in coming, but we also know that the emerging economies will still, in the field of services and also of the liberalisation of industrial goods, need to give indications of coming up with a reasonable package to which we can agree. Listening to some Members in this House, one feels that we do not actually have any interests of our own, but that the only thing that matters is safeguarding the interests of other countries. It is essential that we take seriously the message that goes out from this development round and treat it accordingly. This is indeed a Doha development round, and this time it is intended that priority be given to the developing countries, the poorest above all. Let us never forget how much the European Union is already doing and how great is its contribution to greater fairness for them. As the President-in-Office has already said, we have to become aware of the changed landscape of globalisation. We now have to deal with emerging economies that are aware of their own power, that are global players in economic, social and political terms and want to do what they have to do and play their part. If they are to do that, though, it is to be hoped that they will take a responsible attitude towards this round. If we fail to achieve a positive outcome, or at least a favourable indication as to what further negotiations will be like, more bilateral agreements will be needed, and we will see multilateral negotiations falling apart – which, I trust, is not what we want. There are a couple of important points I would like to address. Firstly, I hope that we will take the same approach as we did to previous rounds of negotiations; that we will have talks with the Commission, with the two Commissioners dealing with these matters, and with Commissioner Mandelson in particular, but, of course, also with the Council. It would be nice if you were to say something about that later on. You are, we know, negotiating within the very tight framework of the mandate you have been given. In the event of any conflict and of you being required to negotiate outside the framework set by the mandate, it would be right for you, Commissioner, to enter into dialogue not only with the Council, but also with the delegation of this House that will be there with you. Even though I know you are not bound to do so, it would be good if you were to discuss these matters with them. Secondly, the European Union will, as it does on every such occasion, be joining with the Inter-Parliamentary Union in holding a separate conference with members from all the various WTO member states present. We would, of course, be pleased if this body were to be able to have talks with you. Thirdly, we emphasise every time how much we would like to see, in the declaration of intent that you help to produce, a concluding reference stressing the involvement of the parliaments in these negotiations, by which I mean not the involvement of the European Parliament – that is for us to do – but the involvement of the WTO parliaments as a whole. I would be delighted if you were, this time, to succeed – with the Council’s support, of course – in getting a statement to this effect incorporated in the WTO’s final statement.

 Mr President, I can certainly endorse what Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca has said. In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we devoted ourselves to hammering out compromises, and it is evident to us from looking at the compromise package negotiated by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer that they and we have in fact been thinking along similar lines. By that I mean that, on the one hand, we wanted to do everything possible to manage a proper energy policy, to develop it and to maintain competitiveness, while, on the other hand, not forgetting the second pillar, with its protection for health, the environment and people at work. The two are directly connected. I believe that these things are present in the compromise, but they are all becoming difficult, and we shall see how our negotiations proceed tomorrow, for we have another day to go before we vote. While we do, indeed, have a compromise package, it covers only registration, and we shall have to see what we can achieve in the other areas, with everything from authorisation to the issues about how to handle data protection and many other aspects. The Council Presidency has made suggestions. I would be happy if these negotiations could bring us, before the end of the year, to a proper compromise both here and in the Council, so that the topic does not end up being shelved. I would also advise all those Members who have made comments about Germany today to stop and consider for a moment the fact that there is a connection between the pursuit of a proper national energy policy in a particular Member State – which, I would add, applies in the case of the Nordic countries – and the sort of proper energy policy that we are constructing in Europe, and it can be summed up in the word ‘competitiveness’. Germany is the third-greatest chemicals producer in the world – behind the USA and Japan, but ahead of France, China and Italy; within the European Union, it accounts for over 25% of the turnover from chemical products and for one in every four jobs in the chemicals sector. These are figures of which you simply have to take note, for they are important, not only for Germany, but also for the European Union, when it comes to maintaining jobs. In 2004 alone, EUR 7.7 billion were invested in research. We are always talking expansively about how much we want research and how we want businesses to invest in it – so let us go ahead and support it! Let me just give you one, final, figure, on the size of chemicals businesses in Europe: 92.5% of them are small or medium-sized. That is another statistic of which we should take note.

 Commissioner, I would like to point out a few aspects to you. You showed how disappointed you are, which is no surprise after a second negative arbitration decision. That is no pleasure, but I can tell you after looking at the website that the story of bananas is a never-ending one; so you should not be too disappointed. I am sure this issue will be with us for many more years to come and even if this is resolved, another one will come up. That seems to be inherent in the case of bananas. Maybe you could be a little more precise and explain the timeframe for action. There is not a lot of time left, but I would like to know what timeframe you have in mind. Secondly, what are the different scenarios you are evaluating? For the Committee on International Trade, it would be more than relevant to know what you have in mind. Finally, as my colleague said, I wonder whether this is not going to overshadow Hong Kong. I would like to know how you are going to make a situation that is not easy in any case – given that sugar and many other difficult issues are on the agenda – look a little more positive.

 Madam President, I have a request to make of you and of this House; it is that we send a letter to the people of Mexico expressing our sympathy. In view of the fact that we have a free trade agreement with that country, and also a special agreement, we should write a letter to the Mexican Government to the effect that we have the utmost sympathy with the Mexican people as they face up to the damage that the hurricane has caused. We should also join with the Commission and the Council in considering the options available under that agreement for providing aid in special circumstances, by which I do not, in this instance, mean financial aid, but aid in its widest sense. I would be most appreciative, Madam President, if you could give me an assurance that such a letter will be written.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on concluding the textile negotiations with a positive outcome. We know how complicated and how difficult that was and our Group would like to congratulate you warmly on that. I very much regret that the Council is not present for this debate. We have just seen how necessary it is for the Member States to act coherently, and I find the Council’s absence from this debate most unfortunate; I would like it to be informed that we are not happy about it. I would like to return to a few points that Mrs Saïfi has already raised. The safeguard measures were introduced in the context of the WTO negotiations; that also shows how skilfully the Commission, the Member States and the relevant parliamentary committee negotiated at the time. We in Parliament have always said that this is necessary. Regarding the first crisis we have just seen with safeguard measures, Commissioner, I would like to ask you something on behalf of my Group. Do you believe that the safeguard measures proposed during the WTO talks and agreed to by China are adequate in the light of the crisis? Do you think that the safeguard measures perhaps need to be reviewed again and possibly amended? When you reply, which you are welcome to do in writing, I should be grateful if you would again make an assessment of the Member States’ role in this crisis and suggest what must be changed in future. There is one point you raised, Commissioner, with which I wholeheartedly agree. You said that China has already become a political and economic world power. That clearly shows, of course, that many of the talks we have held in the past, in the WTO or in connection with other international agreements, are now presenting us with a new challenge. We are now dealing with major world powers: China, India, too, in other areas with its software industry, Brazil when it comes to sugar. What challenges do you believe the European Union will have to face in the future in the light of this situation? You said that business is capable of taking on the competition and pointed out that we are the second largest exporter. My question, on behalf of my Group, is this: do you believe that is enough? Do we need to do more, especially for small and medium-sized businesses? Do you think the aid we sometimes give to firms, many of which even then are guilty of outsourcing, is sufficient? Or would you as the Commission suggest that we need more controls to keep a proper check on it? My final question is this. What do you think of the idea of introducing a European label for products, including textiles, so people can see the conditions under which they were made and the standards to which they were produced? Finally, thank you again and I look forward to your answer.

 Mr President, I strongly support the proposal made by our colleague Mr Stubb. He is quite right. We need a comprehensive Africa strategy. The Presidency representative just spoke about soft power, where the European Union is successful. I think he is absolutely right, but we still need to translate this into positive action. Talking about action against poverty is wonderful, but it is certainly not enough, especially if you consider that we have been putting so much aid into Africa for many years and the outcome is not always very positive. The same applies when we talk about trade and poverty reduction. There is a strong connection. We know this, but do we really understand it? I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade. I would recommend an Africa strategy, which should be the subject of renewed debate by the end of the UK Presidency, taking all aspects into consideration. It would be great if the UK Presidency could reflect on this.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike many Members, I wish to point out that, in the course of our deliberations, all – or at any rate, most – of us have agreed that we want patents in the field of computer-implemented inventions, and that our European industry’s great strength is dependent on us getting them. The present situation is schizophrenic in that businesses wanting to take out patents in this field can do so, and the Commission proposal actually did no more than argue in favour of more harmonisation across Europe. I think all Members will agree that the second thing we want to avoid where patents are concerned is to go down the road taken by the Americans, which would make possible such things as the patenting of software-to-software, when what we want, to put it quite simply in computer language, is software-to-hardware. The great problem we now have is to really tidy up the language. With the vote due to be held tomorrow, I would like to again ask the Commission how this can be done in view of the very large number of amendments before us, the main ones being those relating to interoperability, tabled by Mr Rocard and others, by Mrs Kauppi and by me. I would like to know where the Commission stands on these various proposals, most especially as regards compulsory licensing or limited exclusions for simple software-to-software. Perhaps the Commissioner has something further to say about this?

 Mr President, let me immediately pick up on the point raised by Mr Elles and referred to by my colleague Mr Swoboda, that being that both Europe and the United States bear a great responsibility in global terms and that it is only by acting together that we will enable the less well-off countries to be integrated into the global economy. I would like to congratulate the Commission on its statement, for it has taken a bold step. Politically, we have had a rough ride, and it was for a long time unclear what, if anything, we could achieve in the course of preparations for this summit. Written and oral statements have been made, and these take us a step further. By these I mean particularly the proposals for cooperation in the negotiation of specific agreements, in the field of new technologies and, most especially, in research and safety. All these things are right, proper and important. I am especially glad that the Commission has ventured for the first time to use the term ‘transatlantic market’ and also to find a way of describing what it is – still rather cryptically, it has to be admitted, but it is going down the right road. This is something that this House has frequently addressed in its resolutions. We are very well-advised to acknowledge the reality of what we already have, which is an integrated market. I might add that the OECD study to which Mr Elles referred not only says that we will achieve growth if we press on with integrating the market only within Europe – from which, according to the study, Europe will derive greater benefit than the United States – it also says that we must do this throughout the world, which is an extremely important point. If we benefit from this, then the other countries will do likewise, and so we should take very careful note of what this study has to say. I would, though, like to congratulate the Commission on the study it initiated. It is a good job of work and will enable us to make progress. Now for my last point: here, too, we see the Commission taking on board a proposal from this House; in this instance, that we should work together more closely in the sphere of inter-parliamentary exchange. Mr Jonathan Evans will be saying more about that later. It is an important point, and I propose that we should have further discussions of everything the Commission is proposing – which the Summit will, I hope, take on board – in an inter-parliamentary context.

Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I really only wish to refer to one point, which relates to the announcement at the very end of your speech, Commissioner, that you intend to conduct two simulations in the near future. May I ask you to inform Parliament of these in good time, because it is very important that we should cooperate in this matter. Together with my honourable colleague Jerzy Buzek, I myself took part in a simulation exercise in Washington on 14 January. That was Exercise Atlantic Storm, which was devoted to bioterrorism. We then discussed the subject again in the framework of the New Defence Agenda in Brussels on 25 April. We identified three main points, which we simply must spend more time discussing. The first point was our realisation that cooperation must become far more intensive than we are used to at the present time. This relates both to cooperation among the Member States and to Europe’s cooperation with the United States and with other relevant countries that ought to be involved. This cooperation is extremely important, but at the present time it is still very sporadic in some cases. It is not conducted systematically either, nor does its methodology give us any real cause for satisfaction with the present system. It is not reliable, nor is it transparent, either in general terms or in relation to Parliament, and transparency is crucial if the defects of the system are to be identified and corrected. That is one point. The second inadequacy is in the field of prevention. With specific reference to bioterrorism, I should like to ask you how far we have actually progressed to date on prevention with regard to vaccines. In our simulation in Washington, we established that the availability of vaccines varies considerably between Member States of the EU. This will be a source of conflicts, Commissioner, in the event of an attack, which we hope will not happen. I should like to ask you to comment again on that point. The last point I wish to mention relates to an entirely different aspect of this issue. In our debates we should always take great care to distinguish between Islamic fundamentalists and Islam in general. That would contribute greatly to our political discussion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from what Mr Caspary has just said, there are a number of points I would like to address. I very much welcome the safeguards that have been put in place, and I hope that you can obtain reliable data, including reliable data from the individual Member States. As I see it, Romania is one example of how it is not that simple to get your hands on reliable data. I hope that you will then not delay in bringing that data to the Committee on International Trade, so that we who sit on that Committee can discuss it with you and advise you on it. I also rejoiced to hear that you had, in your speech in Singapore on 29 April, revived an old initiative of this House, that being the demand for closer cooperation between Europe and Asia. This House did once advocate a free trade area and urged that it should at least begin with one state. While we now have a very strong presence in Latin America, there are other regions, Asia in particular, that we have been positively culpable in neglecting. I agree that, where China is concerned, we are paying a bitter price for this. Our major concern – of which textiles might be described as merely a ‘super-example’ – is the unfair competition that, for various reasons, exists in China. Competition may be deliberately unfair, or the unfairness may very well be involuntary. What do you propose to do about it? What can actually be done to ensure that enquiries take a good hard look at such things as disguised subsidies? You also mentioned intellectual property rights, but there is a good deal more to it than that. There is a particular case that you have been considering for a very long time. I would be grateful if you were to say something about it. This case, moreover, has to do with non-ferrous metals, and this House has for some considerable time been calling for an enquiry into disguised subsidies for these. In China, in particular, reimbursement of VAT is used to support the local recycling industry. What progress has been made with enquiries into this? Might I ask you to say something about this? Quite apart from all that, it is a good thing that you have done something about investment. We are right behind you in that respect and wish you plenty of success.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to raise a couple of points that need to be borne in mind when considering this report, which is, after all, the first to be presented by the Committee this year. We will then, in the second half of the year, produce a second one to follow, observe and comment on the Commission’s deliberations and negotiations. As far as both the Committee and my group are concerned, the question to which it gives rise is what can be done, firstly to ensure that we are actually being helpful, in a supportive way, in bringing about a positive result in Hong Kong – even though there will be no final conclusion, a positive result would be nice in any case – so that negotiations can then be continued on a sound footing; secondly, also in order to ensure that the great claim we make in the title of ‘development round’ is justified by reality; and, thirdly, to ensure that the European Union’s interests are defended. This is of course a very complex business when one bears in mind that the outcome of Cancún was not exactly a very good one, that we have had a very difficult start and that the negotiations are currently looking rather shaky. There is also the problem of the countries with emerging economies, which are fighting to be allowed to take up a leading, global role in the world. That is very much apparent from the example of China – about which we will have a debate tomorrow – but also from Brazil and, of course, from India. All this adds up to a very difficult and complex situation. There is another aspect to which we have to give consideration. I would ask you, Commissioner, to revisit the subject of how in fact this House, the Committee on International Trade and yourself are to relate to one another in the course of this year. If the new treaty were already in place, Parliament would have a very great deal more power, with more direct machinery for consultation. Our mechanisms are very good and long-established, but they are all somewhat informal in nature. At the same time, though, it is also the case that the public would like to see us more directly involved, with more power and more rights in a process involving negotiations on agriculture and services sectors. These are very sensitive areas, debate on which can be very vigorous, and on which there are no ready-made and unambiguous positions, whether in our group, in this House or among the public at large. How, then, can we ensure that, in the course of this year, we can organise this critical process involving the Commission, the Committee and Parliament in such a way that the result is fruitful cooperation over and above what we have already established, and including the critical areas I have mentioned? If you actually have to make changes to the negotiations, or changes to your plans – and you can rest assured, Commissioner, that you will have to deal with these things – then how can it be guaranteed that cooperation will be so close that we will really be able to discharge the responsibility placed upon us by the public?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to pick up on a number of points already mentioned by both Dr Tannock and Mr Moreno Sánchez, and also by you, Commissioner. In both these problematic processes – the Mercosur negotiations and the question of how these can rationally be tied in with the ongoing WTO negotiations – we need to make sensible strategic plans, particularly as regards the timetable. Bearing in mind the difficulties that we came up against in the negotiations last year and the fact that neither we nor the Commission have yet managed to resolve them, I do wonder how you think you will manage, by the end of the year, to organise a proper timetable and to extract more substantial concessions than have been made so far. As Mr Moreno Sánchez has already said: how, in fact, do you intend to establish a link between these negotiations, not least in terms of the resources at your disposal? I think both sets of negotiations are enormously demanding and complex, and the whole business strikes me as very difficult. Hence the question as to whether it might perhaps be more intelligent and more rational to provide for more time and more leeway in the negotiations, particularly in view of Dr Tannock’s argument that there are, quite simply, a lot of political power games being played here and that the negotiations between Brazil and Argentina are very complicated indeed, not to mention those with the United States. I think, then, that the big issue is whether we actually have to keep to the timetable that has been laid down, or whether it might be smarter to consider another one. My second question has to do with the texts. I have read that you want to organise a major round of talks with ministers, which will then achieve a breakthrough. That is a good way of going about it; it is always important to get the backing of political leaders. It seems to me, though, that – rather as with negotiations involving the United States and the rest of the world – you, the Commission, are concentrating too much on governments and very often ignoring the parliaments. That is something we, over and over again, have had cause to deplore. Here, too, it might be appropriate to make use of the bodies that we have for this purpose – after all, this House does cooperate with those in the Mercosur countries. Our giving political back-up may perhaps seem difficult, but why should it not be given consideration as a means of stimulating greater political willingness, and also to send the message to the political leadership in each country that parliamentarians want to support negotiations of this sort?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow the four Members who have already spoken by addressing to you another question on the problem under discussion. It was in 1992 that we joined with the United States in adopting the New Transatlantic Agenda, which provides for various dialogues, some of which work well, and others less so. We know that the business dialogue works very well, as does the consumer dialogue, but we have been noticing for many years that there are serious problems with the dialogue that is meant to bring employees together – the labour dialogue, as it is known. There are various reasons for this; to some degree, it has to do with the different traditions in America and Europe. The next summit is scheduled to be held in the summer, and, as a matter of urgency, I would ask you, when preparing it, to get together again with the Council and, as a Commission, to consider what you can do to support this dialogue. Although this is something that should be left to the trade unions, I have learned from experience that it will be necessary to review what we in the various European institutions can do to really keep this dialogue going or, perhaps, to resurrect it. I would have thought this example would be a good one for you to refer to in an attempt to revive this dialogue. I would, moreover, recommend that you raise the problem in the context of the business dialogue and talk to the businesses themselves in order to see whether it might not be possible to come to an understanding, so that the OECD guidelines to which you have referred are actually implemented in practice, rather than being set aside by various states – in this case Kansas, although any other might well have done likewise. That strikes me as enormously important, for, in a global context and with competition at international level certainly not becoming simpler, but rather more difficult, it is only right that the states operating within the OECD framework should actually play the game by the rules. Perhaps you might say where you stand on this point, and say whether or not you can consider including this as an item for discussion. If I might turn to the second point you addressed, that the Commission and the Council – like, I would add, this Parliament – have for many years been pressing for more intensive discussion within the WTO, and for it to include labour standards, environmental standards and social standards, let me say that it would appear to me to be right and proper – although I know it will be very difficult – to return to this issue during the current round, and I can assure you that this House will again refer to it in a resolution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their report. I think they have done an excellent job of work, bearing in mind the angle from which they approached it and their representation of farmers’ interests. It is rather unfortunate that this resolution takes no account of the points of view of the trade or development committees, and I hope we will be able to do that when the House comes to debate and consider the Regulation. We should certainly ensure that we are in line with our obligations to the WTO, and that we comply with its Appellate Body’s decision, and I very much endorse the Commissioner’s proposal. Although, as many Members have indicated, changes are needed, it generally tends in the right direction. I have tabled Amendment No 37, which I hope will be supported. It explicitly reiterates our support for the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative, and, in that context, for the reforms to which reference has been made. Perhaps I might also be permitted to respond in a small way to Mr Sturdy’s interesting comment that he intends to abstain, or refrain from voting, on the grounds that he, while being a member of the Agriculture Committee, is also a producer for the sugar market. Whilst I see this as cause for rejoicing, I do find it remarkable, as he is also a coordinator on the Committee on International Trade. Perhaps he should reconsider his position and, in that capacity, perhaps reflect more the position of the trade committee than that of the agriculture committee. It could be that this would help the House as a whole to evaluate what is before it now. Please allow me, by way of conclusion, to again ask the Commissioner when and how she plans to actually submit her actual proposal for the trading of quotas in the Member States. I got the impression from what you said that you have some doubts, and was myself not entirely sure what line you took on the suggestion made in the resolution that this should be abandoned and replaced by a fund. Perhaps you could say something more on the subject.

 Mr President, there is something I just wanted to ask Mr Rübig. I apologise for intervening, but last night, we agreed, indirectly and informally, that, on the last part, the European People’s Party and the Liberals would not vote for the deletion of the whole paragraph, and that we, in return, would vote in favour of the Conservatives’ and Liberals’ amendment. Perhaps Mr Rübig would say something about that?

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to make two points. Firstly, in April, we will have a further debate on the issue of textiles, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on International Trade will also hold a joint hearing on this topic. On behalf of my colleagues and the two committees, I look forward to continuing this debate and hope that we will, on those occasions, have more reliable data with which to work. Secondly, it is now 2005, which means that at the end of the year, we will have the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong. I think this is a good opportunity to send out the signal to China to which many of my fellow-Members have referred, and to exert gentle pressure by diplomatic means. I believe that it is essential to do so. Finally, it is also important that, in preparing the analysis to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred, there should be real consideration of the various factors involved. We must find out more about what is happening, for example, in Tunisia, Turkey or our traditional EU Member States, both in terms of what is going well and what is going wrong. We really do need a more carefully researched and clearer picture. If, in conjunction with the relevant Commissioners, you could provide us with this before the end of your Presidency, it would be more than helpful.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will follow very similar lines to Mr Brok’s, although I will be focusing rather more on economic relations. The resolution includes a paragraph on the idea of a transatlantic marketplace, a proposal which has already been put forward in several of Parliament’s resolutions. It is an extremely simple idea, based on the premise that our economic integration is much deeper than we are aware and than we perceive it to be, as well as on the premise that this economic integration facilitates healthy growth and secures jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and hence enables us to help the whole world participate in this prosperity. This applies to both the multilateral and bilateral agendas. What we lack, though, is a rational view of this economic and social reality in the political sphere. This means that we cannot continue with the existing New Transatlantic Agenda on its own, and especially not with the Positive Economic Agenda, which is far too technical and apolitical, as well as being impossible to explain to the public. Changes must therefore be made to these agendas, and we must develop some kind of plan, idea or strategy to form the basis of this transatlantic marketplace. What is needed is therefore not a free-trade zone, but a genuine harmonisation of the two economies, which in fact already exists in reality. The idea of the internal market must be adopted, realities acknowledged, geopolitical and geostrategic changes which have taken place in the world recognised and a model applied that already exists in the sectors of competition and trade, where experts work together across the Atlantic. One need only look at the current figures and the relevant Commission documents – for example the Quinlan and Hamilton report – to see that economic relations are currently very close. To give but one example; US investment in the Netherlands in 2003 was at approximately the same level as total investment by US companies in the whole of Asia. I hope that this example will stir the Members of this House into action, and I hope that we can build on it and start to cooperate properly.

 Mr President, there is a simple reason for this. Canada has already been mentioned several times, but I believe that this report and the resolution should really concentrate on Europe and the USA. If the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission wish to make repeated references to Canada, however – and such references are indeed sensible and necessary – I would ask them not to forget Mexico. As Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, this is a matter of some importance to me. If we are going to discuss NAFTA, then we should discuss NAFTA as a whole. I would ask you to bear this in mind.

 Mr President, the errors of management have been sufficiently described, and, rather than enlarge upon them, I want to talk about what we – the Commission, the Council, and also this Parliament – can do. We have to get away from making some laws on the environment – albeit very comprehensive ones – followed by laws on the protection and safety of pedestrians and others, and then laws on mobility, while neglecting, as we did in the past, to put together a truly cohesive and uniform strategy for this sector. That is what is urgently needed if we are not to be helpless spectators while jobs in European industry are wiped out. I believe that we can gain some optimism from what Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen said in the hearings. One cannot but welcome the setting up of a high level group of this sort, but ‘high level’ means not just this or that chairman of this or that company’s board, but also the workers’ representatives; it must involve not just the Commission, but also the European Parliament. I think we can find examples of this in shipbuilding too. There is just one more thing I would like to say, and that is that what the outgoing Commission, as regards jobs in the motor industry, has covered itself with is not just glory. I would cite not only the Volkswagen legislation, but also the Design Directive, as examples of how urgently amendments are needed.

Mr President, Commissioner, as a preliminary remark, I would like to say that I do not believe it was a good idea for this Commission to have taken a decision on this matter, which is so crucial. I think that it would have been preferable to leave this to the incoming Commission, which would perhaps then have placed a slightly different emphasis in terms of content. In your explanation of the decision, you mentioned that a new market would be opened up and that this would mean that new jobs could also be created. In another context you spoke of impact assessments. My question is this: has there also been an impact assessment of this creation of jobs, or is it not rather the case that existing jobs in the industrial sector will be cut, as liberalisation of such matters will now be forced through for ideological reasons, and that by means of this Directive we are moving jobs out of the European Union and into non-European foreign countries?

 Mr President, against the backdrop of the decline in Baltic cod stocks identified in the ICES studies and of demands from the relevant fishing crews for operating conditions that will enable them to preserve their livelihood, I would like to commend the work of my honourable colleague, Mr Chmielewski. He has had to do the splits in order to reconcile the Commission’s proposal and sustainable fisheries on the one side with the resolute demands of the fishermen on the other. If sustainability is to be more than an empty word, however, it must be reflected in working practices on fishing vessels and in personal attitudes to scientific prescriptions. Accepting catch quotas is one side of the coin. In particular, this means not only fulfilling the prescribed basic conditions but also supporting the new measures to improve stocks and more effective supervision by the Member States. Unfortunately, supervision is a weak point in some Member States. There is sufficient untapped potential in this area. The involvement of regional advisory bodies is not only helpful; it is also an urgent necessity. The proposal from the Commission therefore points in the right direction, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports both the proposal and the rapporteur’s efforts to strike a fair socio-economic balance. I appeal to all those in positions of responsibility to take good heed of the information provided by ICES and other scientific bodies when fixing the total allowable catches and quotas for cod and devising measures to halt the decline in cod stocks. The Baltic is a sensitive sea, and we should bear that in mind whenever we consider any measure.

 Mr President, the present Commission proposal does not make any change to the existing rules on the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses, but rather aims to update some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health. We welcome this, but we welcome in particular the Commission’s announcement that it will shortly be submitting a full report on European animal health policy. That would be a good time and opportunity to discuss further-reaching changes to the present rules and, if necessary, to set up a new legal framework. We agree with the objectives of the proposal as set out in the Commission’s explanatory statement, and also with the rapporteur. We support the proposed amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC, and we also support the critical comments and notes by the rapporteur on the financing of the system for monitoring the movement of animals, and also on the system for financing unforeseeable diseases and outbreaks of epidemics, or animal diseases causing lasting harm. Measures for combating animal diseases always require large amounts of funding, and providing this at short notice is often the problem. The rapporteur’s suggestion that certain funds be set aside in a reserve should of course be considered. Our secret hope is that the proposed amendments improve the implementation of the cofinanced programmes on the eradication of animal diseases.

 Mr President, my group supports the rapporteur’s call for clarity and transparency with regard to the circulation of compound feedingstuffs. We also pay tribute to his considerable efforts to find a compromise solution. The discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have revealed a great variety of opinions, especially on the open declaration for compound feedingstuffs. Views differed not only on the pros and cons of individual amendments, but particularly on their legal admissibility. The reason for this was not necessarily the controversial nature of the subject alone, but chiefly the exceptionally complicated legal preliminaries to the procedure. At this point, I should like to remind the House that we are talking about a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council correcting a 2002 directive amending a 1979 directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs that is based on a ruling by the European Court of Justice of 6 December 2005. The codecision procedure has been applied, although, as a rule, the Committee on Agriculture has only the right to be consulted. Following much to-ing and fro-ing, advance talks with the Council produced a line that my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, can support. The Commission has promised to present a revised version of the whole feedingstuffs declaration next year. I hope this will indeed bring clarity and transparency for farmers, for consumers, for the industry and, most of all, for us politicians.

 Mr President, I am in favour of this being treated as an urgent matter. It really is necessary for the Spanish fishermen, and in their interests, that they should be able to fish with effect from the beginning of the season on 1 May. They have for years now had no opportunity to go about their fishing business, and a delay would not essentially change anything whatever about the current ratification process or the content of the treaties.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in May 2005 the Agriculture Council called on the Commission to work in close cooperation with all those involved to draw up an EU action plan for sustainable forest management by mid-2006, which should turn the various elements of the EU's forest strategy into reality. With its own-initiative report on the EU forestry strategy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made an early entry into the discussion, and we want this report to take the process we have initiated further and deeper. Which of our considerations and demands ultimately end up in the action plan is, of course, purely up to the Commission, but the quality of the cooperation – for which I am very grateful – leads us to believe that, on the essential issues, we are thinking along the same lines. The starting point for our own-initiative report was the Council resolution of 1998 on a forestry strategy for the European Union, which offers a whole range of possibilities, but has no specific targets and no coherent structure. In accordance with the various starting points, and alongside some general remarks, we have identified a range of strategy elements. I would just like briefly to go over the most important points. First: Until now, there has been no uniform legal basis for forestry activities at EU level. In our view, an objective assessment would be desirable despite all the concerns of those involved. Secondly: There are various definitions of forest both internationally and in each of our 25 countries, and we therefore ask the Commission to consider drafting a European definition, in order to make the European Union's measures in this domain transparent and comparable. Thirdly: In order to improve coordination, communication and cooperation, we propose strengthening existing structures such as the Standing Forestry Committee. In addition to horizontal coordination, the exchange of information between the levels of the hierarchy within the Commission must be improved using the new Inter-Service Group. In our opinion, this vertical coordination should have a dedicated unit in the Secretariat General. Fourthly: Europe's forests must be protected from forest fires and air pollution, and also from soil and water pollution. Illegal logging outside the EU must be combated by means of appropriate coordinated international measures, and the EU can play its part in this. Fifthly: Forests can help us to slow down the greenhouse effect and climate change, but only if we make greater use of their various products. The EU should therefore promote the use of environmentally friendly wood products and give renewable energy from forests a greater place in its energy supplies. Sixthly: In order to promote the competitiveness of the sector, and thus employment and income in rural areas, Europe needs to address itself more effectively to such tasks as the mobilisation of timber resources, the removal of obstacles to the use of wood, overcoming structural problems in forestry, and the diversification of forest owners’ income. Seventhly: since forestry-related research and development have a major role to play in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, key forestry research projects should therefore be included in the Seventh Framework Programme of Research. Eighthly: European training and further training programmes such as Leonardo and Erasmus should be put to more use than hitherto in the forestry sector. In this connection, the Member States are particularly called on to provide those affected with more information on the opportunities available. Finally: What contribution can the forestry sector make to Lisbon and Gothenburg? We think that Europe's forests, unlike those in other regions of the world, are underutilised, not only with regard to timber – we use only 60% of the quantity grown – but also with regard to services that have previously been unmarketable. We want the European forestry sector to improve its competitiveness in this way, because only a vibrant and competitive forestry sector can contribute to Lisbon and Gothenburg and thus to the wellbeing of Europeans.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, deserves thanks for his committed work, which enabled the achievement of what was, after all, an acceptable compromise. He was not helped, of course, by the fact that the Agricultural and Fisheries Council had taken a preliminary decision. Although we do not have power of codecision in this field, this decision can only be tolerated in the light of the 2005 WTO negotiations. The compromise that has now been reached remains a tremendous challenge for those affected: within the EU as well as the ACP and least developed countries. Even though the affected parties will receive compensatory payments, there will be losses of income one way or another. In future, many sugar-beet-growing regions in the EU will not be able to grow as much sugar beet for food purposes or, in some cases, any at all. The Commission should follow the lead taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this regard and examine the possible scope for increasing the funds per hectare available for non-food crops. In my view, the key proposals of the Agriculture Committee are similar to those of the Agricultural and Fisheries Council. I hope that the compromise is adopted in the end, as it will give beet growers planning security and enable sugar-beet production in the EU to continue in future in spite of severe cuts. Sugar-factory operators also share responsibility, however. Their task is to implement the regime of the future market organisation in such a way that viable socio-economic solutions can be devised in cooperation with the trade unions and staff representatives.

 Mr President, there can be no doubt that Decision 2004/465/EC, on a Community financial contribution towards Member States’ fisheries control programmes, has helped to improve both control structures and the provision of funding for controls in the individual Member States, and to make the flow of information more efficient. It has also made it possible to confer greater powers on EU inspectors in the field of monitoring and control. Control programmes are always and everywhere regarded as a nuisance, and often as discrimination, by those who have to undergo the controls. It is an unfortunate fact, however, that controls on fishing activities under the common fisheries policy are indispensable, as we have learnt from experience. The success of any legal framework depends on the effectiveness and ease of controls on compliance with the rules it lays down. It goes without saying that the measures carried out in the framework of these control programmes cost money, and that the necessary funding should accordingly be provided for them. We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal to extend the period of validity of Decision 2004/465/EC by one year. This would safeguard the Community financial contribution towards the fisheries control programmes at least until the end of 2006, even if the budgetary environment changes. We concur with the rapporteur’s assessment of the amendments outlined by the Commission in the proposal for a decision, and we should also like to thank him.

 Madam President, we endorse the report’s fundamental objective and welcome the intention that changes be made to definitions and various technical provisions. Debates on proposals from the Commission that might lead, in the long or short term, to restrictions being placed on fishing activity, are always heated, and that on this proposal has been no exception. It might not be evident from the outcome of the vote in Committee, but there were a number of points on which a compromise could be reached only after in-depth discussions. With this in mind, I would like especially to draw attention to Article 12 of the Commission proposal, which deals with restrictions on, and the prohibition of, driftnets. Our group has previously endorsed all attempts to provide for a reduction in the use of these devices or a ban on them, and so it necessarily follows that the same strict rules should apply in the Baltic as in other European Union fishing grounds, in which driftnets have for years been banned in order to give small cetaceans a better chance of survival. Certain efforts are being made to jeopardise the current ban on driftnets, and these our group repudiates. Day-to-day practice shows, however, that a valid legal framework will only be any good in so far as it is capable of being monitored, simply and effectively, on the ground, in other words, in practice. This, I think, is where the main difficulties lie, and I hope that this legal framework will result in a more vigorous approach to monitoring in future.

 Madam President, the laying down of a sustainable common fisheries policy will do nothing to make our tasks in this area less daunting. Let me give just a few examples to illustrate why it is so extraordinarily difficult to enforce the Community’s requirements without the funding to do so: the restructuring of the fisheries sector in the new Member States, improved controls in fisheries, international fisheries agreements such as the forthcoming one with Morocco, fisheries research to provide better data on the basis of which to manage stocks. It is for this reason that we endorse the Commission’s preliminary draft budget and reject the Council’s.

 Mr President, the destruction of a huge number of boats has meant that an entire sector of the economy has been damaged. Aid can come in many different guises, and one way in which emergency aid could be provided would be to transfer fishing boats that would in any case be taken out of commission in the European Union. These boats could, then, be taken out of service in the European Union, but the victims of the tsunami in South-East Asia could reuse them if they wished and asked to do so; they would, indeed, be exactly what would meet their requirements. In order to provide emergency aid in this way, however, amendments must be made to the legal framework currently in force. Most of the members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcome this opportunity, which will remain open to us only for a short period of time, although we are obviously aware of the many problems it entails. In our opinion helping people to help themselves is always the better option in the long term, and this should be apparent from our amendments. Yet we view this proposal as a political sign of solidarity, and will support it accordingly.
 Kindermann (PSE

Mr President, control is already an important component of the common fisheries policy, and it will become even more so in the future. It has been and remains a priority aim of this House to make controls more effective in the fisheries sector. For this reason, we support the proposal for the establishment of a European Fisheries Control Agency. There are, however, wide disparities between the various fishing regions in the European Union. We therefore believe it would be wise to ensure that the organisational structure of the agency takes account of regional differences. The common fisheries policy has undergone further development over the past few years, but the international obligations of the European Union with regard to fisheries remain a major element of the CFP. All of this requires not only effective but also uniform control procedures or coordination of control activities, as appropriate. The establishment of a European control agency should guarantee this. The aim must be the improvement of national control structures, with the Member States continuing to determine how they use their own control instruments. We assume that the establishment of organisational structures at the Community level could result in more consistent compliance with existing statutory provisions. In our view, some of the rapporteur’s amendments do not contribute to the pursuit of these aims and are too broad in their scope. The competence of the agency must remain clearly visible. For this reason we are opposed to the inclusion of regional advisory councils in the organisational structure. Although the rapporteur has done a very good job, we are unable to support amendments that would take us down that road.

Mr President, the large majority of people in the European Union, probably the majority of governments in the European Union, and almost certainly the majority in this House, hoped in November that Barack Obama would be elected president. That is a good thing, even if perhaps a little scepticism has crept into some of the speeches during this debate as to whether all this was such a good thing. Of course Europe must consciously represent its own positions in the future, but the time for malicious comment about the United States is past, because we can no longer conveniently shift everything on to George Bush, and that sets us a task. Policy on transatlantic relations on the part of the European Union, on the part of this Parliament, can no longer consist simply in tossing demands in the direction of the United States; now we must also reply with what we want to contribute in order to make this partnership efficient. Take for example Afghanistan, which several Members have mentioned. What do we want the European Union to do in order to enhance and strengthen police missions, in order to push ahead with civil support and civil reconstruction in this country? That would be our task as the EU; NATO can take care of the military side. This is something that we must discuss very specifically. What do we have to offer?

 Mr President, it is not true of the Council, but we here in Parliament and, as a result, also the Commission, are edging towards the finishing straight for this electoral term. For that reason, I think it makes sense that we should act not merely as the accounts clerk checking the balance sheet of the European security and defence policy’s progress, but in a much more fundamental capacity. I must admit that I am absolutely torn between two ways of looking at this. I tear my hair out when we have to deal with the day-to-day necessities, when a mission is threatening to fail for want of six helicopters, when there is no political will in the various capitals or when there are splits on technology projects. When I look at things from a historical perspective, however, everything looks different, and Mr Solana, in fact, deserves a great deal of praise in this regard. The European security and defence policy has only been in existence for around ten years, we should remember, and the document on the security strategy was only produced in 2003. On that basis, the progress made is really quite great, from a historical point of view. As a historical optimist, I choose the latter point of view in case of doubt. The second point that I, as a social democrat, would like to address, relates to something for which neither the European Union nor NATO is responsible, but which affects us all as Europeans. It relates to developments in connection with the missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic. We, as social democrats, are very pleased to hear that things that we have put forward are now being implemented in connection with changes in the United States. We have always said that it does not make sense to rush the decision on the stationing of equipment, as there is not, at this time, any threat from, for example, Iran. Hillary Clinton said last week that further decisions at the US end will be taken in the context of what happens in Iran. Joe Biden has said that it is dependent on technical capabilities and financial considerations. These are things that we welcome. We will, at least, not be the last doomed brigade left fluttering the flag of this missile defence system.
 Helmut Kuhne, 
 rapporteur. − (DE)
 Mr President, in our report, we wished to avoid repeating statements from previous reports on the European Security Strategy. Perhaps we have not entirely achieved this but I believe we can go further down this track in the future. For example, one point that was decided on in earlier reports and that we did not address again for precisely that reason, but that should be mentioned here, is the European Parliament’s support for the European Security and Defence College.
 We would like this to become a real institution, not just a virtual one. Measured by European standards, time has passed very quickly since December 2003, when the European Security Strategy was adopted – perhaps not necessarily when measured by objective standards, but it can be said that the European Security Strategy has made significant practical progress during this time. There are some achievements to boast of, but I will not enumerate the different civilian and military missions here. However, what we can show, structurally, is that, for the last year or so we have had a civilian control and planning instrument on the Council side and that there is now a clear chain of command from the building over there right down to those who have to carry out operations on the ground. From the military perspective, we have strengthened operational capability beyond the use of NATO capabilities in accordance with the Berlin Plus Agreement. We have made the Battle Groups, which are supposed to work on rotation, operable. We have also carried out operations that we can declare successful, such as the missions in the area of the rule of law in Georgia and other similar missions. However, there are some tasks that still have to be undertaken and where, in my opinion, there are still deficits, and it does not make the Security Strategy any poorer if we list these points. When measured by the population figures for the EU Member States, there is an imbalance in the contributions to the missions, particularly in the civilian area. We therefore propose that the Member States be obliged – whether morally or by other means – to issue action plans detailing what staff capabilities they can make available to the European Union should it become necessary, including statements on the career prospects of people who return to their own country after serving on EU missions. In the long term, we cannot manage the agonising mechanism of providing troops for military actions such as Darfur and Chad, as we have done up to this point. We are therefore suggesting alternative options. We are also making several suggestions for dealing with the helicopter crisis and increasing the availability of helicopters. In the long term, it makes no sense for us in the European Union to be flying around in 24 different types of helicopter. In addition, there are new developments that we must consider as we reflect further on the Security Strategy. Terrorist activity has brought about a blurring of the boundaries between internal and external borders. Securing energy supply through diplomatic, economic and technical – and I am deliberately not saying military – means must be tackled. Securing sensitive infrastructures against electronic attacks is something we have become aware of. All these things need to be included in our consideration of aspects of the Security Strategy that may need to be expanded upon. Mr Solana, the EU High Representative, has a specific mandate from the Council to think about such things. We support him in that. We would hope to see the result of these deliberations towards the end of the year in the form of a White Paper so that there is a common reference point for European discussion, not only for discussion between Mr Solana and the governments, not only between him and us, not only in the national parliaments, but also in the interests of the European public, from Poland to Portugal.
 Helmut Kuhne, 
 rapporteur. − (DE) 
Mr President, this final chance to speak gives me the opportunity to do something I did not have time to do earlier on – to thank Commissioner Verheugen and Mr Solana for the excellent cooperation with their staff, who were available for discussions and from whom I learnt a great deal. This had a very positive effect on the report. I would also like to thank the all the committee members, particularly the committee chairman and rapporteur for the other report, Mr Saryusz-Wolski. We occasionally sent notes to each other, like schoolboys, when we had overlapping issues in our reports, in order to achieve the same wording. That also worked very well. I would like to add three points:  First in English, since some of the speakers addressed the question of the Irish referendum. On the legend of militarisation: my report contains a full list of arms control and disarmament proposals – a whole page of it. Secondly, the Lisbon Treaty retains the right of every Member State to stay away from EU missions, especially military missions. This right is not infringed by the Lisbon Treaty in any way. It was very interesting to hear self-proclaimed advocates of NATO expressing their fear for the independence of neutral Ireland as part of the ESDP. I think that was very interesting.  A final point, which Mr Pflüger mentioned, relates to the issue of parliamentary scrutiny: I do not know whether this was a deliberate misunderstanding, but the text that occurs in both Mr Saryusz-Wolski’s report and my own does not preclude groups having access to confidential information. The formulation is an open one. Here in Parliament, we must first do our homework in order to develop some kind of negotiating position in relation to the Council. What level of security clearance do we want to grant to how many Members? It may well be that we say that all groups are granted a certain level, and some groups another level, and so on. We will have to develop that ourselves first, and neither of our proposals prevents the groups from participating in this. I do not know whether this was a deliberate misunderstanding, or if the text was so unintelligible – I do not think it was – but we should first sit down together here in Parliament and develop our own negotiating position in relation to the Council.
 Helmut Kuhne  (PSE

 Mr President, a fundamentally positive relationship with the United States does not preclude differences in interests and opinions. I believe that a partnership on equal terms is possible only on such a basis. Only in this way can we also convincingly counteract anti-Americanism. For this reason we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of a direct dialogue on security policy with the United States on those issues in which the European Union has jurisdiction. I would put forward two examples of this: the credibility of Western values when combating terrorism and the subject of stabilisation and reconstruction. For precisely these reasons we are against the EU’s open or hidden links to the US National Security Strategy, as we see them in one of the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to the report on security strategy, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, because it is perfectly clear that no President of the United States will ever accept that a third party, whether or not it is the EU, becomes a cosignatory to this National Security Strategy. Why should we therefore tie ourselves to this same thing with a blank cheque? This is not equal terms and we are therefore against positions such as these.
 Helmut Kuhne  (PSE

Mr President, we Social Democrats have been persecuted by every totalitarian and authoritarian regime of the 20th century, whether by the Nazis or by the thugs of Stalin, Franco or Mussolini – the list is long. That is why we not only have no problem with but actually welcome a reappraisal of the crimes under Stalinism. We can only applaud it. Yet this reappraisal should follow the rules of historical methodology and not be confused with the rules governing criminal court proceedings. We must guard against confusing these matters. It is not a question of counting up the victims or of a re-run of the Nuremberg Trials; this time we are trying an ideology rather than identified criminals. There are, however, also points at which we must quite clearly say ‘no’ and we Social Democrats have identified a few of them. We say ‘no’ to the attempt to establish a new framework for interpreting European history, which emerged from the speeches made by some Members of this House at a conference held on 22 January this year. We are deeply opposed to the view that the extermination of European Jews by the Nazis came from a conception of history that was developed by the Soviet regime. We reject that view. We reject it all the more firmly because in 2006 we found that another colleague from the same ideological spectrum sent a roundmail to all Members of this House in which he described the two Latvian Waffen-SS divisions as part of the German forces, thereby playing down their role. We reject that interpretation too, especially in connection with the first sentence. We also reject the assertion that the West did nothing to bring about change in what was then the Soviet-ruled part of Europe. It was the CSCE in Helsinki that first gave the civil rights movements in those countries room to breathe, with the successful and happy result we see today as we welcome representatives from those countries to our House. These are points we insist on and will continue to pursue.
 Helmut Kuhne (PSE

(DE) 
Mr President, as we have just heard, even here in our European Parliament there are representatives whose priority is not to modify the behaviour of the Iranian regime but to destroy that regime. I believe there is one thing that has to be spelled out very clearly, namely the logical imperative that those who seek the destruction of a regime and focus their policies on that goal will do nothing to modify the regime’s behaviour. Yet such modification must be our aim whenever we discuss the nuclear issue. The diplomatic offensive would be greatly reinforced if the United States were directly involved in the talks, because it can offer something the European Union cannot provide to the same extent, namely security guarantees. As Mr Solana pointed out, the findings of the US intelligence services do not warrant the conclusion that the Iranian programme is not a potential threat. That is indeed a problem, and it cannot be solved by removing the pressure. The issue cannot be taken out of the UN Security Council, because that is liable to result in the Iranian regime eventually saying, ‘Thanks, that’s it now – we have enough highly enriched uranium; it’s time for us to renounce the Non-Proliferation Treaty and start producing our nuclear weapons’. Should that scenario materialise, we would have no alternative but to revert to the strategy of nuclear deterrence we know from the sixties and seventies. One thing we should exclude from this debate at all costs – and let there be no doubt about this – is the so-called military option. Whatever is understood by the term ‘the West’, whether it be North America alone or whether it include Europe, exercising the so-called military option would be a political disaster which would rebound on the West for decades to come in its relations not only with the Muslim world but also with countries such as India that have helped to put this issue on the agenda of the UN Security Council.

 Mr President, we members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament endorse Mr Brok’s report, even though our views differ as regards certain aspects of concrete political measures; for example, we take the view that the concerns and fears felt in some of the European Union’s Member States about the stationing of the American anti-missile system triggering a new round of the arms race should be voiced. I might add that we Social Democrats are extremely pleased to note that some of the same questions that we have about this system are now also being raised in the US Congress’ House of Representatives. Why, though, are we supporting your report? We support it because it is presented in a quite specific situation and was endorsed by a broad majority in the committee, and the situation in which we find ourselves is the final stretch leading to the creation of a new treaty basis for the European Union and for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We social democrats want that sort of progress. I hope you will excuse my bluntness when I say that it may well turn out, tomorrow, that there will be more determined backing for it from our ranks than there will be from elements within your own group. It is when we are discussing matters such as these that someone should speak out about what it is all about; you were right to do just that, and I want to underline once more what you said. The day will come when it will no longer affect those of us who sit here, but it may well be that it will affect our grandchildren, who will, one day, read in their history books that, in 2007, Europeans once again had an opportunity to help determine the fate of the world, that they threw the chance away, and influence over the world was thereafter shared out between the United States and China. If that is not to happen, then this House, in the situation in which we find ourselves, must endorse this report and give its backing to these measures, many of which Mr Klich has enumerated, and I agree with his description of them, which should, by tomorrow, be the common position of the great majority in this House.

 Mr President, I want to pick up on the announcement by the President-in-Office of the Council that a demand will be made at the summit for the visa waiver programme to be extended to all citizens of the European Union. That is a very important announcement, for if that happens, all the EU’s citizens will be able to experience the practical effects of European policy, and the division that exists among them in that regard, to which you referred, can be done away with. Moving on to security policy, we Europeans can very definitely take pride in the way that the political approach that we raised as an option – with its combination of diplomacy, pressure and offers to Iran – has now become the policy agreed on by the European Union and the United States and it was this approach that brought the world community together, while others had driven them apart from one another. If, though, there is a policy on which all agree, one question arises naturally in connection with the anti-missile programme to which many have already referred, for, if we are persuaded that this joint approach promises success, then the issue to be settled before any debate on the stationing of the missiles and on who is to be involved in it is why, if it is possible to get Iran, by peaceful means and negotiation, to renounce nuclear armaments, it is so necessary that a decision on the positioning of these rockets be taken right now, and, since I have not, so far, heard anything from the participants in this debate on security policy that settles the matter, I would be very happy if this question were to be put on the agenda.

 Mr President, I would like to say something about communication. I too object to the idea of enlargement as a foreign policy instrument, but my reasons for doing so differ from Mr Posselt’s; I do indeed believe that we have problems, for you can see for yourself how whole brigades of well-meaning global strategists, laden down with foreign policy instruments, scurry through Europe and beyond, proclaiming: ‘Worried about the threat of civil war? Join the EU!’ and see in all its clarity the reason why so many citizens of the EU say: ‘No thanks, I am not an instrument. I do not exist to solve foreign policy problems. That is not why I regard myself as a citizen of the EU; if that is what the European Union is about, I would rather not have anything to do with it.’ The second thing I want to say about communication is that it raises the question of what actual relation there is between the constant claim that we have to discharge the obligations into which we have entered, and our willingness to take a rigorous line with candidate countries both in the course of negotiations and in the run-up to them, in order to get these countries to make commitments and stick to them, when, in this debate – and congratulations to Mr Posselt – every conceivable back door is opened in the hope of getting one party or other’s favourite candidate into the EU before the Constitution has been adopted. The man and woman in the street is very well aware of the message that sends out, so there is no cause to talk about enlargement fatigue in an accusatory tone of voice. Those who think the only problems have to do with matters of fact would do better to get stuck in to these communications problems.

 Mr President, let me say something quite brief about the view our Socialist Group in this House takes of what has emerged from the committee. There are three things that we regard as important. First of all, there is the need to reinforce the diplomatic and civil elements of the security strategy. Secondly, there is the need to avoid the traps that might leave us with an unfounded military doctrine; the text contains no terms such as ‘pre-emptive’ or anything of the sort. Thirdly, the instruments and the institutional requirements must be kept absolutely separate. We regard these as important advances, and it proved possible to make progress on these points by means of good cooperation with the rapporteur, for which I am grateful. From a social democrat point of view, however, there still remain a few controversial items outstanding. We can see the risk of the procurement wish lists getting longer and longer as Christmas draws nearer; we ought to be concentrating on the priorities we have already set ourselves, such as air transport, information and communication. We do not actually need to aspire to amphibious motor vehicles, a Mediterranean fleet, and aircraft carriers, which hinders us from going after the things that really are important priorities in terms of the strategy. The question must also be asked as to whether the last-named examples belong in some quite different context rather than in the security strategy. On the other hand – although we will be endorsing most of the amendments that add precision to the parts of the text that have to do with diplomacy, civil society and disarmament – we do not believe that crisis prevention must, under all conceivable circumstances, involve the use of exclusively non-military means. The reality we face today has already changed, and the rapporteur made reference to that. We have sent troops to Macedonia in order to prevent the outbreak there of a civil war similar to those that have broken out in other states belonging to the former Yugoslavia. In the Congo, we used not only civilian means, but also sent a contingent of troops, in order to ensure that the elections there could be held in peace, and I am confident that this contingent will be able to return home at the end of this month. As I conclude this intervention, I should like to return to the point that the rapporteur made at the very outset and was quite right to highlight, namely that the analysis of the threats and of the action taken under the security strategy need to be reviewed on a regular basis. Once the report has been adopted, the next thing we should do is to discuss how we, in this House, can organise this process.

 Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, you have a pleasingly straightforward way of presenting your findings in plenary. I will therefore be equally straightforward in expressing my thanks to you. Thank you, and that without any flowery words hiding qualifications. So an unqualified thank you. You have worked carefully, you have made the best of an unsatisfactory situation that is not primarily of your making. It would be difficult to question your findings and hence the grounds for your conclusions on the basis of the facts. I therefore advise those who may be tempted to feel offended in the present situation not to be, but to set to work and complete the tasks that are still outstanding. If in the autumn your report shows there are still deficits, the Commission should propose safeguard clauses. Parliament should then give the Commission its backing, although each of the two countries should be treated separately. For me, however, this debate is also an occasion to draw further conclusions, over and beyond the two countries at issue. Some other Members have touched on it, and I will say it again quite clearly: there must never again be accession treaties without the accession conditions being fulfilled in their entirety. Bulgaria and Romania in any case complete the list of 27 countries that were in the Nice catalogue, so to speak. There can only be further accessions if the European Union also does its homework and makes the necessary internal reforms to ensure its continued existence with more than 27 states.

 Mr President, apart from the technical debate on this deployment, there are also other aspects that should be discussed here too. In part, small-minded prejudices are involved here. In my country, Germany, instead of openly talking about a dark continent where people are permanently involved in internecine conflicts out of pure necessity, some CSU politicians, for example, suggest that Germany’s army would be better used guarding World Cup stadiums in the immediate future instead of being sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo. I think that we should make it crystal clear that this is an incredibly narrow view of the world. I admit, Mrs Beer, that there are a great many issues that remain to be resolved, very serious problems that have not yet been solved. I am also very confident that they will be solved, including by our colleagues in Germany’s Bundestag. What should interest us at European level, however, is something that has not been mentioned so far. I consider that in recent weeks serious deficits in the European decision-making process have come to light, deficits that remain to be removed. It is not acceptable for some people to say that they demand deployment plans before troops are made available while others say that deployment plans will only be drawn up once we are certain that we will not have to set off alone. That is not on, and would lead to a kind of self-imposed blockade. Without demanding unrealistic treaty amendments, we need to achieve an outcome whereby a review of decision-making processes is conducted without delay at Council level, so that in situations in which decisions have to be taken more quickly than is the case at present, it is actually possible to take those decisions.

 Mr President, I welcome the change of perspective that is set out in Mr Brok’s report. Our debates can no longer be about our preference for one country rather than another; instead, we must, at last, face up to the question as to what sort of political system the European Union can actually afford if it is to become better able to take decisions and act on them. That is the fundamental issue on which all others depend. It is for that reason that our next step must be to clarify terms that have not as yet been defined. The Copenhagen criteria make reference to the concept of ‘assimilation capacity’, while not, however, defining it. As I see it, it must involve at least the political and institutional arrangements set out in the Constitutional Treaty. While I have listened attentively to what the Commissioner has said, he can correct me if I am wrong, but I have not heard him say anything about this. Inherent in the decision as to what is a criterion of capacity to assimilate is the potential source of dissent between us and the Commission. Among the important criteria are that the European Union should be funded in such a way as to have a viable future and its being accepted by the people who live in it. If we are to talk in terms of credibility, that credibility, and the criteria that can properly be applied to capacity to assimilate, require that it should not be possible for another country to accede for the foreseeable future once Bulgaria and Romania have done so. Credibility is about more than a promise to accept people at some unspecified time; it is also about specifying the conditions under which they can be accepted at all, and that means that we have to be more precise about such concepts as ‘enlargement perspective’ or ‘prospect of accession’. We have to be very clear in our own minds that the belief that a country’s accession will resolve tensions and internal security problems is an erroneous one. Such tensions and problems must be resolved before accession negotiations start.

 Mr President, the implication of Mr Wurtz’s question to Mr Solana as to what had improved in the last two years is that decisive improvements in the state of the world are in some way within the power of the European Union to decide upon and bring into effect. Those who wanted to see a multipolar world with the might of its only superpower reduced can hardly be surprised that this is the case. What some Members have said tends to reflect their Eurocentric views and their disappointment at our place in this multipolar world. I can do no other than bid them welcome to a world that has, alas, become no more pleasant for being multipolar and for being home to burgeoning new powers on a global and regional scale. We Europeans are far from that badly off in this situation, and I join with those who have congratulated Mr Solana on reaching, with China and Russia, a joint decision on the issue of whether to make Iran’s nuclear ambitions a matter for the Security Council. While I can only hope that that bears fruit, I am far from dissatisfied with the present approach.

 Mr President, let me start by saying a few words to Mr Batten. It was interesting listening to this speech by a representative of a list of candidates that also includes two people who, in very quick succession, have been publicly found guilty of abusing the secretarial assistance allowance in recent weeks. We should intensify our offensive against this band of hypocrites in this House and in our public-relations activities. Now to come to the point. It does not make sense for various companies in three major EU Member States to work on the Unmanned Air Vehicle project, for example, in separate projects that have nothing to do with one another, and to duplicate earnings, as it were. The European taxpayer does not deserve this. Nor does it make sense for three major EU Member States to develop, separately from one other, electronic identification systems for infantrymen, and for there to be insufficient clarity as to whether troops from one and the same European battle group, for example, could identify each other in action if they came from different countries. We should also bear in mind that even in 10 years’ time the armies in the EU will still have to use 23 different types of armoured vehicle. We can all imagine the kind of compatibility and supply problems that would entail in operational conditions. I should also like to warn against one illusion, however: a single European Defence Equipment Market cannot be achieved if enterprises operating under market conditions have to compete with those that are government-backed. This is an aspect that has not yet been raised in today’s debate, and I should also like to suggest that it might make sense for Mr Wuermeling to take a closer look at this implication of the debate on Article 296 and draw conclusions from it for the future.

 Mr President, as so many footballing metaphors have been laboured, perhaps I might be allowed to make a few comments on the rules of the game. This is not a second debate about whether or not Bulgaria’s or Romania’s accession should go ahead. That decision has already been taken and I am glad to see the observers here today. I would, though, like to make two observations, which are addressed to us ourselves and to the two countries in question. Let me start with us ourselves: Mr Van Orden has called for tough action aimed at combating corruption and crime. In some of his press releases he has specifically referred to trafficking in people and drugs. He also, though, more or less openly stated that deferment of accession beyond the envisaged date of 2007 is absolutely out of the question. I would remind the House that, if we were to put the two together in the way in which he has, it would be to declare bankrupt the theory that accession to the EU provided an incentive for more domestic reforms. What incentive for reform is left, after all, when the pressure is taken off, if it is guaranteed that accession is going to go ahead anyway? So let me make it perfectly clear that the date has not been decided in advance. That they will join is a given, but the date on which they will do so remains undecided; it is dependent on what is done by the countries in question during the time that remains, and by nobody else. There can be no input on the part of the European Union, nor can any kind of discount be given. I get the feeling that not every aspect of the acquis communautaire
 is equally important. I do believe that the EU public’s need for security may make the combating of crime and the securing of the external borders more important than the number of cars with insurance cover, although things might well look rather different from the motorist’s point of view. There are, though, or so I believe, different hierarchies of problems, and that is why every country will be judged separately. It used to be very comfortable to travel in convoy, with one country’s weaknesses being compensated for by another’s strengths, but those days are no more; from now on, every country will be judged separately.

 Madam President, looking back over the speeches made in the past hour, and particularly the last one, I have to say that I have come to understand why some other Members of this House are concerned that Iran might be pushed into a corner and no longer be prepared to engage in dialogue or negotiation. I think it needs to be reiterated that what the troika and the EU bodies offered in the course of the dialogue is a balanced strategy in relation to Iran. It is true to say that there is no built-in guarantee of success, but there is no alternative to it. Any one of the military options mentioned in this debate would be politically disastrous, quite apart from the question of whether or not it would be workable. That is something that has to be made abundantly clear. A number of my fellow-Members who have spoken in the course of the last hour also need to be reminded that we have already had experience of a situation – in Europe, too – in which two powers, armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, were squaring up to each other. If it had not been for their ability to consider each other’s security interests from each other’s point of view, there would have been neither a Non-Proliferation Treaty nor disarmament, and we might well have already been through a nuclear war. I would have been killed in it, and so, probably, for that matter, would those who have been sounding off in a bellicose fashion. That is something for us to think about. It is indeed the case that we have to be able to include in our calculations the legitimate security interests of other regimes – even of this one. It makes sense to have a strategy that offers them something, but we should not rule out the possibility of using the Security Council as a means of exerting pressure; to do so would be politically foolish.

 Mr President, there has been no shortage of historical references in this debate; for Germans, too, relations with Russia possess a specifically historical character. I believe that all parties could unite in saying that German politicians are glad that, after many decades, good relations with Russia have been restored. If one is to calculate quite coldly, on the basis of our own interests and of the security interests of the new Member States, I believe that their security interests benefit more from these good relations than they would do if the situation were reversed. It follows, then, that it is negligent or worse to allow the EU to be used as a sort of trampoline, with the help of which one jumps up in the air in order to give the Russian bear a hefty thump on the nose. I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Laschet’s earlier criticisms of didactic tendencies, and what Mr Brok had to say about keeping avenues of dialogue open. I have to say, though, to Mr Laschet, that there are two things he should not do. For a start, you should not share out the bearskin among the nations before the bear is dead. Secondly, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, for I am quite certain that summits would take place between Germany and Russia even if Germany had a CDU government – and who knows, we may even see such a thing in 20 years’ time. You should not try to imply that such summits would no longer happen.

 Mr President, all Members have a copy of the update I have proposed, which involves the following substitution in paragraph 8:  ‘… report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change presented to the UN Secretary-General on 1 December 2004’ with ‘… report presented by the Secretary-General of the UN entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all” on 21 March 2005.  (DE)
 This simply involves an update. As Mr Samuelsen raised the problem of names in connection with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
 I would point out that this problem does not occur in the text to be voted on. If it were to occur at all, it would be in the justification, but that is not what we are dealing with.
 Kuhne (PSE

 Mr President, I should like to start by considering two different scenarios. When we discussed this issue in committee, Mr Ilves asked what would happen if another terrorist attack on the same scale as the Madrid bombings were to take place in an EU Member State, and if, in the aftermath of such an attack, it were to emerge that the security services in another Member State had been aware that preparations were underway for the attack, but had been unable to inform the authorities in the country in question. In all likelihood, this would trigger a real crisis of legitimacy for the European Union. I will now move on to my second example. The European Union has taken command of the NATO-led troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is the first time that the European Union has had an opportunity to prove that it is capable of conducting security policy in this area, and to gain practical experience in such matters. I know from talking to my constituents that many people believe that the EU would be delivered from evil, as it were, if it kept its involvement in other people’s business to a minimum. This kind of attitude can turn out to be fatally flawed, and the European Union does in fact need a security strategy. It is for this reason that the vast majority of committee members welcomed the document which was drafted by Javier Solana during his term in office, and which the committee has continued to work on. We also welcomed the support shown by the governments of the Member States for the document. There are, however, a number of issues that must be given particular consideration, as they reveal the unique nature of the European Security Strategy. The first of these is the need to understand security problems and their many and diverse possible causes, which include human rights violations, poverty and disease, in a broad context, and not to reduce the Strategy to its military aspects. The Security Strategy is primarily a political concept, and as such transcends military considerations. The second issue is the need for a commitment to international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The third issue relates to the need to strengthen international order by means of effective multilateral structures and to safeguard citizens’ fundamental rights within the EU, whilst taking all measures necessary to combat terrorist threats. In view of these factors, we should not be ashamed to say that the European Union does indeed wish to acquire military decision-making structures and capabilities. The greatest benefit of the Security Strategy is that it enables us to tailor the combination of civilian and military crisis management capabilities to each individual situation. Opposition to this approach came from two deeply opposed camps within the committee; on the one hand, some members find it impossible to envisage the European Union as anything other than a subsidiary of NATO, whereas on the other hand some members condemn militarisation in the shape of new organisational forms and capacities. Both of these camps represent polar opposites, yet what they have in common is that they use their arguments to oppose and campaign against the European Constitution. In spite of this opposition, however, a broad consensus was reached within the committee in favour of the Security Strategy, which involves the establishment of various instruments such as a situation centre, a civilian/military planning cell and the setting up of battle groups or the Defence Agency. These are not alternatives to NATO, and indeed most EU Member States are also NATO Member States. Instead, they provide the European Union with new options it has not had in the past. This is the only way it can become an equal partner, for example of countries on the other side of the Atlantic like the United States. A great deal remains to be done, however; for example, we still have no coherent plan of how civilian crisis management forces should be organised. There is a lack of permanent air transport capacity and of permanently available deployable troops, as well as of adequate communications and reconnaissance capacities. The aim of this report is to ensure that the European Parliament – also in view of what Mr Brok said in his introductory speech – can exert an influence on the future development and practical implementation of the European Security Strategy within the framework of dialogue with the Council.

 Mr President, we Social Democrats advocate a single strategy for all GM’s sites in Europe. In our concern for social responsibility, we always risk being pushed into a corner, and sometimes we allow that to happen, but there are points here that have to do with the economy in the traditional sense of the word. Despite that, there are a number of mistakes on the part of the management to be added to the list, to which it had been alerted by the workers’ representatives on various occasions, one such mistake being the fact that, unlike Volkswagen and the Japanese, Opel does not sell its cars outside Europe, in the USA, for example. I am not talking here about the top-of-the-range European models that are sold there. A further mistake was that materials were bought in cheaply, with the resultant expense of remedial work at weekends. New work patterns were introduced abruptly, and the group became over-centralised. It is necessary to draw attention to these points, particularly now – and I very much agree with Mr Mann on this – that representatives of industry associations and the ideologues retained by them are hard at work dismantling the types of co-determination that we in Europe introduced as part of our social model, and pronouncing them unsuited to the modern world. That being so, I agree with much of what you, Mr Mann, had to say, but why did your group, with its majority in this House, refuse to table a resolution? Perhaps they did not want the substance of what you said to be adopted in this House this week. That is a point that must be addressed head-on, for much of what you have said we Social Democrats can agree with. It is only embarrassing that your party colleague in Bochum should raise the question of whether the crisis might have been resolved if the regional or local promoters of trade and industry had been able to do something different. Those are narrow-minded answers – what we need now is something different! (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are less than two hours away from the final decision on the European Economic Recovery Plan. It has taken us five months – needless to say because of sophistry in the Council – five months to come to a decision on the package now before us. Had we taken the title of this package at all seriously, we would have had to be much quicker. The package in itself is fine; there is no question about that. However, I very much doubt whether it can really bring about Europe’s economic recovery in the current crisis. Can the designated money flow into the designated projects within the designated time? It is a good thing that the Members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy also had their doubts and negotiated a declaration from the Commission not to put leftovers into energy efficiency. There is a chance therefore that the EUR 2.6 billion to be decided on will be used reasonably. But will we also manage to agree on the EUR 2.4 billion deficit in the EUR 5 billion Recovery Plan with the Council in the autumn? EUR 5 billion over two years are an expression of European solidarity. That is all well and good. However, more effective help for the entire European economy comes from a common regional and structural political framework: EUR 38 billion – this year alone! These resources are the driving force behind the European economy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the directive on industrial emissions is long overdue. A piece of legislation in which all the significant measures to reduce pollution depend on the best available technique should be adjusted at least every five years, rather than after 13. After such a period, the techniques have moved on far ahead of us. At the same time, we must note that, despite the march of technology, the targets associated with our directive from back in the day have by no means been met. That is why I have such a high opinion of the compromise achieved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Its implementation will get us where we need to go. I find the hysteria when we deal with soil protection or the wishes of the farmers’ unions incomprehensible. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to achieve environmental targets without impeding economic activities. Doing so is very much looking to the future and not looking backwards, as the proposals from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do.

 Mr President, we have of course attempted to take account of the new situation in our oral amendment. We wish to reiterate to the Council our willingness as Parliament to enter into negotiations on the EUR 5 billion that the Commission has proposed for revision. Our amendment reads as follows, therefore – I shall read it out in English, as we have been working in English, so as to get all our fellow Members on board as quickly as possible:  ‘Expresses its strong willingness to enter into negotiations with the Council on the basis of the Commission’s proposal for a revision of the MFF 2007-2013 for EUR 5 billion in the framework of the proposed European Economic Recovery Plan; takes note of the conclusions of the December 2008 European Council in that respect’.

 Mr President, this concerns the European schools in Brussels. We have discussed this at length in the course of many talks. The figures previously in the text need to be tightened somewhat, as we want the Commission to really take action. Therefore, the new text also sets a deadline for it to do so. I shall read it out in English again:  ‘Notes with concern the situation of present and future young pupils in the European Schools in Brussels resulting from the delayed and still pending opening of the fourth school in Laeken and the current enrolment procedure leading to long and unacceptable travelling times for the children; expects the Commission, in cooperation with the Secretariat-General of the European Schools in Brussels, to present a revised enrolment procedure by the end of March 2009 with objective and comprehensible criteria (including the principal residence and already enrolled siblings), which will come into force with the next enrolment period’.

 Madam President, Commissioner, it seems the President-in-Office of the Council is not quite here yet. In any event, the second reading of the European budget is on tomorrow’s agenda. In all probability, the vote will not take much time. The fact that few things remain to be put to the vote and even fewer are in dispute is thanks to the constructive cooperation among all the Members involved – both in the specialist committees and in the Committee on Budgets – for which I should like to express my sincere thanks. I am all the more pleased since I know that this cannot be taken for granted. This also goes for the groundwork done by the entire team on the Committee on Budgets, the work of all the group staff and the support of the personal assistants, so thank you! I should also like to extend my thanks to the Commission for its willingness to cooperate. Its communications with us may not always have pleased everyone concerned, but it was always helpful and, above all, it spoke to me at the various levels, which cannot be said of the Council Presidency. Thus far, the French Council Presidency has not managed to speak to me, the general rapporteur, on a single occasion. Not one single time! I have not even received a response as yet to a letter I wrote before the trialogue on 13 November – which is very strange, very disconcerting. What was not at all strange or disconcerting, however, was how the Council team behaved at the conciliation meeting. Its behaviour and attitudes were what we have come to expect. Firstly, there must be no revision, however small, under any circumstances. Secondly, the payments are to be reduced in any event, even if the gap between payments and commitments becomes a ravine. Thirdly, the unspent appropriations from the current financial year should preferably be handed over immediately. In any case, approximately EUR 4.9 billion will be channelled back to the coffers of the national Finance Ministers. We in Parliament are delighted to have been able to persuade the Commission to promise a carry-over of EUR 700 million for rural development. We also think that the binding joint declarations on simplifying the procedure and on accelerating the implementation of the Structural Funds programmes, and also the promise that more funds for payments would be proposed without delay if need be, will be helpful in managing the tasks of the coming financial year. These tasks will be not exactly trivial. The impact of the financial market crisis and its repercussions on the real economy will be felt in all our Member States. Therefore, Parliament is, by all means, prepared to free up funds for job creation or preservation, funds for providing economic momentum – in addition to the range of instruments already at the disposal of the European Union. We are prepared to do everything necessary at the maximum speed possible – not indiscriminately, of course, but if it is clear what projects the funds are to be provided for and how appropriate they are, not one of us will be left in the lurch. Parliament is also prepared for a revision of the medium-term financial programme. First of all, however, the Council needs a common position. We may be voting at second reading tomorrow, but I have the vague feeling that what we are voting on is just a budgetary framework. The additions to it will be demanded of us little by little over the year.
 Jutta Haug,

 Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members who have participated in the discussion in this House, who have delivered speeches, even if, in several cases, the 2009 budget was just the occasion for the speech rather than the subject of it. Above all, I wish to thank the Members who have stayed with us from start to finish and joined in the discussion. The European Economic Recovery Plan presented to us by the Commission has been raised in many speeches, and is preying on many people’s minds. I can do no other than reiterate what I have said many times before: the European driving force for Member States’ economies is EU cohesion policy. Really implementing this properly and honestly will enable us to get ahead, and will undoubtedly mean that the economy does not cause us such great problems over the next year. Of course, we would not get by on our EUR 116 billion in payments, but the whole of Parliament would be standing by to guarantee the relevant payments in supplementary and amending budgets. What the Commissioner said is true, of course: a budget is always a compromise. The 2009 budget is no different from its predecessors in that respect. We have had to grant the Council these low payments, the Commission has had to grant us the EUR 700 million redeployment for regional development, and we have had to cut back our priorities. Nevertheless, we have managed to preserve a good many of these priorities: more payments for action to combat climate change, more payments for the social dimension in terms of the creation of more and better jobs, and more for support for SMEs. We have accomplished this, and for this I am grateful to all my fellow Members. Thank you very much! (Applause)

 Mr President, the explanation process is the same as it is every year. Before the vote I need to inform Parliament about some technical adjustments. I know that this is not very interesting for my fellow Members, but we need to record it in the Minutes. Firstly, as already indicated in the voting list, the vote on amendment 783 to budget line 22 02 04 02 only concerns payment appropriations. Secondly, the explanations concerning the global energy assessment do not belong on budget line 08 03 01, where they have mistakenly been included, but on line 08 05 01. Therefore the vote on amendment 936 to line 08 03 01 must be made without the comments on the global energy assessment. These will be included instead in amendment 938 to line 08 05 01. I know how enthusiastic everyone is about this. Thirdly, the reinstatement of resources in the Preliminary Draft Budget for the decentralised agencies with their titles in lines 1 and 2 also includes, of course, the reinstatement of their establishment plans. This applies to the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Railway Agency, the European Environment Agency, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, the European Food Safety Authority, the Community Fisheries Control Agency and the Community Plant Variety Office, whose establishment plans are not specifically included in the documents accompanying the amendments. Fourthly, as the result of a comment from the Legal Services an explanation included on several budget lines must be slightly modified. This concerns the sentence which begins ‘The Commission may’ up to ‘and to transfer to the internal auditor of the Commission’ in the following amendments: Amendment 994 to line 19 04 01, amendment 1011 to line 21 02 01, amendment 1015 to line 21 03 01, amendment 1016 to line 21 04 01, amendment 1026 to line 23 02 01 and amendment 785 to line 23 02 02. The correct version of the explanation is detailed in the voting list. Fifthly and finally, the budget line 19 06 06 with the title ‘Consular cooperation’ is not included in the amendments, although it was adopted as part of the amending letter No 1/2009. This new budget line will therefore be included using a token entry (p.m.). If none of my fellow members have any objections to all of this, the sittings service will include it all as we have decided.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the preparations for the first reading of the European budget for 2009 are pretty much complete. I would therefore like to start today’s debate by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets, and all the members of the specialised committees who have worked so closely with me, most sincerely for their cooperation and for all the time they have devoted to this. As I said right at the start of the 2009 budget procedure, and I am happy to say again, a budget rapporteur is only as good as the sum of the members working with her, so I am very grateful to you. I also need to thank the team in the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets: without the consistently excellent work of the secretariat staff, we Members would, with the best will in the world, be nothing, so thank you! Yes, I agree, a round of applause would be quite appropriate. (Applause)
 My thanks also go to my personal assistant and to the staff of the groups: it takes many heads and many hands to do a good job. The preparations for the first reading of our budget, during which we had to read, understand and evaluate 1 400 amendments, were greatly affected by the financial crisis. Although our budget of around EUR 130 billion looks ridiculously small set against the hundreds upon hundreds of billions that the Member States, acting both jointly and separately, have spread out as a safety net under both the banks and the real economy, our meetings to prepare for the first reading were nevertheless much shaped by contributions on precisely this subject from all the groups involved. In so doing, we were basically already anticipating the Council’s reaction to our budgetary requests. What, then, are our requests? First of all, there are the payments. We pointed out back in July that we could not approve a 15% gap between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations, which the Commission proposed in the draft budget and the Council increased still further. In our opinion, that does not fit in with the principle of budgetary accuracy and clarity. Moreover, when we compare this gap in the third year of the current Financial Perspective with the gap in the third year of the previous Financial Perspective, which was only 3%, we simply do not see how such an enormous gap can be justified. We have therefore increased payments: we could not close the gap completely, but we have halved it, to leave a gaping hole of 8%. We did not increase payments by acclamation or at random, but in those budget lines that help to fund Parliament’s priorities: action to combat climate change, the social dimension in terms of growth for jobs, shaping globalisation and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and also certain lines that improve the safety of citizens. In total, we have increased payments from 0.89% of gross national income – which was the level proposed by the Council – to 0.96%, rounded, of gross national income. Secondly, we decided to make full use of the options afforded us by the Financial Perspective. Under subheadings 1a and 3b, we want to distribute all the money to the budget lines that are important to us, and not leave any margin. We want the title of subheading 1a, ‘competitiveness for growth and employment’, not just to be purely rhetorical, but also to include specific measures. We do not want the title of subheading 3b, ‘citizenship’, to be an empty phrase – we want to bring it to life, as, after all, this subheading brings together policies that directly affect citizens at local level, and that the European Union is particularly good at making visible. Thirdly, we have given the package of pilot projects and preparatory measures, which was agreed between all the groups and has already been evaluated by the Commission, a range of impulses for new policy elements, new Community actions and possibly new legislation. Fourthly, we have followed our political judgment. Nobody can expect good administrative work, be it from the Commission or from decentralised agencies, if they do not provide a large enough budget for staff, and we therefore cannot accept the Council’s cutbacks. We have restored the approach taken in the preliminary draft budget, and in return the Commission could not only thank us, but also be on our side in disputes with the Council. Fifthly, I would like to turn to the biggest problem, namely Heading 4, grandly entitled ‘EU as a global partner’. When this heading was established back during the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, it was already hopelessly underfunded. That is why, in each year’s budget debates, we have stressed the same thing: how are we going to fund everything that is looking for funding and, at the same time, leave ourselves enough breathing room to be able to react to unforeseen events during the financial year? I can say right here and now that there has been, and still is, no satisfactory solution. For our assistance in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Palestine and now Georgia, what we really needed was long-term programmes, not this continual hand-to-mouth existence. This is nothing new, but this year the Commission gave us a new challenge: in view of the enormous global increases in food prices, in July it proposed what it called a food aid facility for the less developed countries, with a budget of EUR 1 billion for 2008 and 2009. If the Commission had been diligent, it should immediately have suggested transferring the necessary resources from Heading 2 to Heading 4. It did not do so, though, because not only is it not diligent, it is afraid. It was afraid of not getting approval from the Council, and now we are saddled with the problem. We need to convince the Council not just to sermonise about the need to help the poorest of the poor, but to work with us to find the resources – yes, and where from? – so that we can provide direct food aid and buy seed and fertiliser. It was quite clear to the Committee on Budgets that we would not be able to find the necessary money in the budget lines under Heading 4, and so we created what is known as an ‘asterisk amendment’, containing EUR 250 million for food aid, 40 million for Kosovo, 80 million for Palestine and 20 million for Afghanistan. This asterisk amendment, which makes it quite clear that we want to spend more than the money available according to the Financial Perspective, should be seen as an invitation to the Council. Let us hope that the Council will actually see our note as an invitation or demand, and enter into negotiations with us without delay. We have no time to lose – we should not leave everything to the last minute. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is over to you. (Applause)

 Mr President, I am grateful to all those who have taken part in this debate. To you, Commissioner, I would like to say that I know, as do we all, that the Commission is never particularly happy when the Parliament sets reserves. We do understand that, because you feel the pinch, but this year we wanted – and we will see this in the vote tomorrow – to lay down conditions for releasing the reserve that you will be in a position to meet quite independently. These conditions are not a cloud cuckoo land where you have to rely on and badger other people in order to get your money – Parliament has been very reasonable here. In the great majority of cases, we will be able to release these reserves relatively quickly, by the second reading, because you will have met the conditions we have imposed – I am firmly convinced of this. Mr Jouyet, I realise that you cannot make us any specific promises here and now, but I assume that you were serious about what you said about both recognising and wanting a climate of cooperation. Allow me to make one comment regarding your plea to take account of the financial policy context in which we are operating: I think this context is one digit too large. Our budget runs to just under EUR 130 billion; together, we have room for manoeuvre of a few hundred million. We can argue about that here, but it bears absolutely no relation to the larger context to which you referred. Once again, I am much obliged to all my fellow Members. We will, I believe, be able to bring a well-prepared debate to pass relatively quickly tomorrow.

Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you just said that we are at the start of the budgetary process. As far as Parliament is concerned, that is not the case. We had begun the budgetary procedure and discussions on the procedure and on our budget for 2009 at the start of the year. We have therefore come a long way already. In particular, moreover, we in Parliament are agreed that neither the Commission’s preliminary draft budget nor the Council’s draft – which, as we know, has pruned back the appropriations for both commitments and payments contained in the Commission’s estimates, is particularly inspiring. We certainly do not regard it as an ambitious budget that satisfies the demands made of us in the European Union in every possible area of political activity. In particular, Parliament has recurring difficulties with the fact that, for all the constant and ubiquitous talk of wanting to tackle climate change, this intention is insufficiently reflected in the budget. We in Parliament – as you can see from the overwhelming support the chamber gave the negotiating team from the Committee on Budgets in the July vote – will ensure that the fight against climate change can be stepped up in many parts of the budget and that this can be done with European funds. We do not believe that such a wide gap can remain between the appropriations for commitments and those for payments as the 15% proposed by the Commission, which has subsequently been further widened by the Council. Instead, we shall ensure that we obtain a budget which is more in tune with the principles of budgetary accuracy and clarity. No doubt we shall have the occasional heated discussion this autumn. I am very hopeful, however, that we shall arrive at a satisfactory outcome once we have come to an arrangement with each other on certain matters.

 Madam President, the interest of the Committee on Budgets in the legislation on electronic communication, the so-called telecom package, is naturally focused on the part involving expenditure from the European budget. In other words, we are interested in the agency – the European Electronic Communications Market Authority proposed by the Commission and renamed the Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT) by our colleagues in the specialised committee. To put it plainly, as things stand, we do not have enough money under subheading 1a for this agency in either form. For this reason, we very much welcome the fact that the lead committee has taken our amendments on board in its report and is proposing a structure that puts less strain on our budget. We must all work together, however, to ensure that we make BERT a European body and that we in the European Parliament retain control of it. I must also remind the House that, under Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament and the Council must reach agreement on the funding of BERT.
 Jutta Haug,

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what should the budget for the European Union for the year 2009 look like, and what could it look like? We have been talking about this since the beginning of the year, and now we are about to embark on the second step by the European Parliament in this year’s budgetary procedure, which is a little different from those of previous years. This is due to the fact that we want to start preparing ourselves in a small way for the amended procedure after the Reform Treaty. After the resolution on the Budgetary Framework and Priorities for 2009 in April comes our resolution ‘First reflections on the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget and mandate for the conciliation’. This resolution was adopted unopposed by the Committee on Budgets and I hope very much that the plenary session will also take a unanimous decision on it, especially as the comments and suggestions from the specialist committees have been included in it. What are we concerned with here? The title tells all. We assess the preliminary draft budget with which the Commission has presented us and find much in it to criticise. We do not see that the draft reflects budgetary truthfulness and budgetary clarity, that it is sufficiently transparent. We already know that that the Commission, too, has to cut its coat to suit the limited cloth of the medium-term financial framework. However, that does not entitle it to use creative budgeting techniques to create available margins. Nevertheless, such techniques have been used – for example, the backloading of multiannual programmes; the fact that known and easily discerned needs for financing are not taken into account; and the non-budgeting of the Guarantee Fund estimated at EUR 200 million a year. We do not see that the Commission has reflected in the figures the political priorities it formulated itself in its Annual Policy Strategy. These are priorities that Parliament has vigorously supported, to wit the fight against climate change and the promotion of competitiveness for growth and employment, closely linked with the promotion of a sustainable Europe and of course the realisation of a common immigration policy. Most importantly, we expected greater commitment to the fight against climate change. The Commission claims to have earmarked almost EUR 14 billion in the budget for the environment, but closer inspection reveals that, of this EUR 13.842 billion, EUR 13 billion is already allocated to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. This amount will therefore have to be supplemented. We also need to do more in the area of competitiveness, mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises, but particularly for small enterprises. The first step was the Small Business Act. The 2009 budget should provide a specific SME facility available to SMEs, who must first sue for their debts. It is all very well to have laws that dictate that the 30-day time frame must not be exceeded, but how are SMEs supposed to implement them? Bridging loans under this facility can, however, prevent bankruptcy and job losses, and that is also in our interest. I do not wish to address now the insufficient budgeting to meet the requirements of food aid, food security, Kosovo, Palestine, Afghanistan; indeed, of the whole of heading 4. My fellow Members will do that in a minute. I only wish to tell the Council, whose representative is no longer here, unfortunately – I cannot understand why he would be present for the one-minute speeches but not when we start talking about the budget – that Parliament is fiercely determined to enter into true political dialogue with it. We want to implement the European priorities, and a proper budget is required in order to do this. After all, our European budget is nothing other than politics in the form of figures. (Applause)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many kind words, for your appreciation of my work and, of course, for your support. However, you know as well as I do that the work can only be done, and done properly, when all Members pull together on this. Only then are we strong enough in relation to the Council to be able to push through the things that we believe are essential. I particularly liked the way that Mr Surján described the Commissioner and me when he said that we were like two interlocking cogs. I find it a particularly good image because when two cogs mesh, they move something, and that is exactly what we want. We want to set something in motion; we want to avoid a static budget and, above all, we want to move the Council. As the President said, the Heads of State or Government can issue communiqués about all manner of wonderful things at their summit meetings but, in the end, the Commission and Parliament have to get the whole thing moving. Of course the Council is part of it too, as one arm of the budgetary authority, but mostly I get the impression that it is always up to us to drag the Council along with us in this movement because the Council itself does not take the initiative in providing impetus. We have analysed the Preliminary Draft Budget yet again, exchanged views on it and clearly carved out what we want from the budget for the European Union in the next year at a very early stage – before the summer recess. This gives us a good basis on which to move into the preparations for our first reading after the summer recess. I hope that all Members will support it as soundly then as they have done today.

Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on the Environment was pleased with the work done by the Directorate-General for the Environment and the Directorate-General for Health. I know that is something you do not hear from me very often. Usually I criticise the Commission, but in this case ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. Those responsible for budgets in both Directorates-General are very cooperative. Thank you very much. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Dan Jørgensen. He worked hard throughout the entire budget discharge procedure, has presented an excellent report and generously took on board all the conclusions of the Committee on the Environment on granting discharge for 2006. The Committee on Budgetary Control has thereby acknowledged what the Committee on the Environment adopted unanimously. Thank you very much for that, too. May I now to say a few words about our agencies. We in the Committee on the Environment were also pleased with the work and budget management of the four agencies: the European Environment Agency, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency. When we advised the Committee on Budgetary Control to grant discharge for the 2006 financial year, it was not done lightly. Quite to the contrary! There was frequent exchange of information with members of the management board and with the directors in the committee. In addition, several delegations from our committee visited the agencies to satisfy themselves as to the activities on the ground. Therefore it was all the more incomprehensible to us all when the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control did not want to grant discharge for three of the four agencies, for the most incredible reasons – particularly as, even if they were valid, the agencies themselves were not responsible for those points, for example staff regulations relating to temporary staff of the institution, or the location of the head office of the relevant agency, or even the way the principle of subsidiarity was observed. Phrases like: ‘There has been irresponsible proliferation,’ ‘new agencies have been set up on the basis of bizarre political decisions, these new agencies are not subject to control and are often uncontrollable, mostly inefficient and, above all, they give rise to significant burdens on European taxpayers,’ and ‘at the same time, an unprecedented range of staff privileges has become established’ – have nothing but shock value. We are all well aware that there is a deliberate scheme afoot to whip up a scandal about work at European level. I utterly abhor this scandal-mongering. Agencies are European administrative units, although they have a unique nature. They do not just drop out of the sky; they do not just occur spontaneously to the Commission alone; they are established by a proper regulatory procedure, either by codecision or in consultation or, depending on the policy field, by regulation, i.e. by legislation. This means that these agencies are brought into being by the European legislator, which means that we are the ‘adventurers’ being referred to. The budget for the agencies is part of the budget of the European Union itself. Each financial year, we discharge the director. I believe there is no section of the administration that is controlled as well as the agencies and I am therefore delighted and thankful that the committee has put a stop to this attempt to create a scandal.

Mr President, Commissioner Hübner, ladies and gentlemen, this year’s budgetary procedure is special because it is the last one to obey the rules that have applied in the past. As of next year we will be establishing our budget according to the procedure set out in the Lisbon Treaty. That means our Parliament will have to concentrate more carefully because we will have to express our political will in budgetary items and budgetary figures at a single reading. We will no longer be able to rectify, to amend compromises we have reached, or to make up for mistakes at a second reading. The first and indeed only reading must remain and must serve as a workable basis for negotiations with the Council up to the end of the year. It is therefore important for us to emphasise that alongside the 2009 budgetary procedure we expect to make preparations together with the Council and the Commission to ensure that we conduct the budgetary procedure in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty. Our current budgetary procedure is, however, somewhat different already. At the suggestion of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, the Committee on Budgets has decided it will no longer submit our usual guidelines in response to the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy in the form of an initial motion for a resolution in plenary, but will instead present our proposal on the budgetary framework and priorities for 2009. The groups are responsible for the APS resolution, which will address all the policy areas. We in the Committee on Budgets have concentrated on the overarching budgetary concerns we consider especially important and have set them out in 11 paragraphs. I want to draw particular attention to three aspects. Firstly, it is clear that our budgetary cloth has been cut very closely, i.e. it is a very tight fit. The margins for the individual headings are very small. We cannot fund political priorities that would urgently need budgetary flanking measures, such as playing a practical role in climate policy, without putting earlier priorities at risk. The same applies to funding growth and employment or a sustainable Europe. If we take, for example, Heading 1A we see that we can under no circumstances finance any new agencies with available funds. We will have to stick to our old, but simple and eminently reasonable principle of ‘new tasks, new money’. Secondly, it is clear see that Heading 4 is chronically under-funded. The picture there remains the same year after year. We expect the Commission to present us with a preliminary draft budget that has analysed the requirements precisely and is realistic. We want at last to use the flexibility instrument for the purpose for which it was introduced, namely for unforeseen needs. We do not want it to have been swallowed up, in part or even in full, by the end of the year. Thirdly, we are firmly resolved to inform the Commission before Parliament’s summer recess of our intentions regarding pilot projects and preparatory actions. We expect the Commission to leave us adequate margin for manoeuvre for this parliamentary instrument in the preliminary draft budget, and to do so for all headings. We certainly noticed that it has not included the pilot projects and preparatory actions in the tables attached to the Annual Policy Strategy for 2009. In conclusion, we are resolved not to go beyond the financial framework but are very clearly aware of the restrictions and problems and therefore hope for good cooperation with the Council and the Commission.

Mr President, I thank all the speakers in this debate. I am, of course, also grateful for the good wishes and praise I have received. Let me also thank the Commissioner. If I have understood correctly, the Commission is supporting us all the way and promising a preliminary draft budget that will take account of everything we want taken into account. We have once again made our priorities plain. They are neither few in number, nor are they exactly small: tackling climate change, creating growth and employment, a social Europe, research, training, education, aid for the poorest countries in the world, fulfilling our tasks in the world. It is not easy actually to finance all that. I wish the Council had been listening, for then it would have seen that – thank God! – all, or at least nearly all the parliamentary groups stand united here. For that, I warmly thank all concerned.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgets is positive about the Commission’s proposal to lead Europol out of its interstate position and into communitisation. If Europol is therefore soon to be funded entirely from the European budget, Parliament’s budgetary rights must also be protected by the structures. The Committee responsible has kindly adopted all our respective amendments. I also hope that the list that Commissioner Frattini has just read out is not exclusive, because I noticed that a number of amendments were not included. We have all, however, got it straight that part of the administration would again be financed by operational resources. We now call upon the Council to sit down at the table with us immediately and come to a mutual agreement on the financing of Europol, because one thing is certain: everything we decide tomorrow applies only under the proviso of the result of the Council negotiations in accordance with Article 47 of the interinstitutional agreement of May 2006.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the budgetary procedure for 2008 has shown how far the European Parliament can progress in negotiations with the Council if we are determined to implement our ideas for a European policy. From the outset we have said that, following the demise of the public-private partnership idea, Galileo would have to be financed with European funds on the basis of the Community method. Anything else would have been unacceptable to Parliament. Parliament stood its ground on that point and then pressurised the Council – or, let us be honest, forced the Council – to break new ground in voting by a majority – not unanimously, mind you – to approve the compromise with us, which includes what is termed a small revision. I say that here as a German who is grateful to the Portuguese Presidency. As a result, we shall be able to fund Galileo and the European Institute of Technology properly until 2013. While this makes me proud of our Parliament, I am not forgetting, of course, the extremely helpful role that the Commission has played in this budgetary process. My sincere thanks go to you, Commissioner, and to all the staff of your departments. You unquestionably helped to ensure that the Council was put on the right path, not only in relation to our competition and innovation policies but also with regard to the arrangements on foreign policies. Our compromise will also provide us with enough funds for the time being to honour our European commitments in Kosovo and Palestine. It goes without saying that Parliament has had to pay a price for this progress. In 2008 an appropriation of EUR 285 million will be made to the common foreign and security policy. While this is EUR 125 million more than the 2007 allocation, we are all well aware that heading 4 will remain chronically underfunded until the end of the period covered by the financial perspective. However delighted we in Parliament might initially be at this shift in the Council’s position, we must also strongly emphasise that the Council has not only remained focused on its main aim of paying out as little as possible but has actually achieved that aim. Total planned expenditure amounts to EUR 120.3 billion, which represents only 0.96% of the combined gross national income of the Member States, whereas the financial perspective provides for 1.04%. In 2008, then, we shall have a tight-fitting budget, although we should have preferred something more comfortable. All the more reason for a concerted effort on our part to ensure that the Commission implements the multiannual programmes swiftly and correctly, that it acts on our comments on specific budget lines in ways that match our intentions, that its initial response to our proposals for pilot projects and preparatory measures is to seek ways of implementing them, not to describe all the obstacles to their realisation. I call on all Members, including those who serve on specialised committees, to monitor the implementation of the 2008 budget systematically and critically. Let me conclude by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, all my fellow Members and the secretariat for their wholehearted constructive cooperation in 2007. I hope for the same parliamentary solidarity in 2008 whenever I have the task of drafting a report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has restored the budget figures reduced in its sector by the Council to the amounts stated in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. This means a 10.3% budget increase for the environmental sector compared with the 2007 budget year. We believe this is also entirely appropriate for the most important instruments in the environmental sector. The EMEA, EEA, EFSA and ECDC – these are the abbreviations for our agencies, with whose work we are entirely satisfied – have also recovered their money. Life+ is agreed, work is beginning and the new health action plan is also replacing the old one from January 2008. So far, so good – all of it! We shall certainly be able to make an evaluation at the end of the year or in early 2009. The HELP programme is giving us cause for concern, however. We know how harmful tobacco consumption is. However, we also want the European public to hear and understand this message. 2008 is the last budget year in which we shall be receiving money for this anti-smoking campaign from the tobacco fund. We are asking the Commission to think very quickly about where the money for this campaign can come from in subsequent years.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has done this year what it always does: it has allowed its civil servants in the Ministries of Finance to put together a budget that takes into account the Council’s main aim which is ‘keep the figures down’ and, most importantly, ‘keep payments down’. It bears no relation to the political plans that we in the European Union want to implement – no relation at all! The Council in its many formations is still in the habit of preaching on Sundays and being content to let others, that is, Parliament, do the real work for the rest of the week. It does not matter whether the issue is external policy matters, or aid for Kosovo or Palestine or about implementing policies on competitiveness for growth and employment that are extremely important for Europe, vital to its survival, in fact. Parliament looked ahead and pointed out, even during negotiations on the financial perspective 18 months ago, that there would be problems with financing exactly these policies within the foreseeable future. However, our message fell on deaf ears and now the Council has to make it up as it goes along. Sooner than we expected, we are facing a situation where we are having to provide public funds to rescue the Galileo project because the dream of entrepreneurial initiative has collapsed. The European Parliament was able to agree fairly quickly that it would finance the beginning of the Galileo project with European money, by using the ‘Community method’. We see anything else as quackery, and want no part of it. We are prepared to provide Galileo with EUR 2.4 billion from 2008 to 2013, in addition to the EUR 1 billion that were already planned. However, since the required funds are not available in Heading 1a, and are not going to fall from the sky, we are prepared to take it from other budget categories, from Heading 2 2007 and 2008, making EUR 2.2 billion, and EUR 220 million from Heading 5. Certainly that is a lot of money from Heading 2, but it is possible without farmers being deprived of funds. Prices for agricultural products are high on the world market, so our subsidies can be reduced. The transaction for which we created the basis in the Budget Committee in the first reading, is called a ‘minor revision’. Pah! The Council avoids even the most minor of revisions like the plague but that is the Council’s problem. Anyway, we are prepared to create the preconditions for Galileo, a flagship of European technological innovation. That fact that, as part of this minor revision, we are prepared to make funds available for the European Institute of Technology is, for us, worth only passing mention, due to the size, well, actually the smallness, of the amount initially required: EUR 2.9 million from 2008 to 2013. We expect the Council to get moving and to come to Parliament and move in our direction. Mr President, allow me one further remark. We really expected the Finance Minister or at least a State Secretary from the Portuguese Council Presidency to attend this debate at the first reading, so that we could welcome his presence. Nothing against you, Mr Mourato, but even the Portuguese Vice-President of our own Parliament is no substitute in this instance.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the share of the Budget made available for the policies that are the particular concern of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is not a particularly large one; in 2005 – the financial year in respect of which we are now supposed to be confirming the proper handling of the European taxpayers’ money – it amounted to less than half a percent of the overall Budget of EUR 116 billion. I will say right at the outset that there was nothing that prevented the directors of the four agencies – the EMEA, the EEA, the EFSA and the ECDC – from being given discharge in respect of their management of their respective budgets. The first months of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control’s operations, in 2005, were successful, and the management of its budget was the responsibility of the DG Health. In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority, in its third year of operations, was in the process of moving to Parma, which entailed difficulties in recruiting the necessary highly-qualified staff and without doubt made it impossible for all the funds allocated to it to be spent, so that over four million euros found their way back into the Community budget. How this money, which is the EFSA’s, is being, or is to be, made available for use again this year is not something for us to discuss in the course of this discharge procedure, but we will have to discuss this with the Commission. The European Medicines Agency has done its work to our general satisfaction, and has not spent all its money, one reason for this being evidently that there were technical difficulties with the conversion of its IT system. The European Environmental Agency did the excellent work to which we have become accustomed, made proper use of all its funds, and could certainly have done with even more. The Committee on the Environment has no fundamental criticism to make of the management of its four agencies’ budgets, but we have taken the opportunity of this discharge procedure to demand of the two ‘old’ agencies – the EMEA and the EEA – that which is already required of the ‘new’ ones in accordance with the basic regulations establishing them, namely that their work be regularly reviewed and evaluated by independent experts. We would like to see added value to Europe assured by all forms of administrative activity in Europe – and that includes the agencies. I will now turn to the side of the environment, public health and food safety for which the Commission bears responsibility, and here, although the take-up for commitment appropriations was highly satisfactory in all areas, it has to be said that the payment rates left much to be desired, being below 80% not only in health and food safety, but also in the environmental sphere. There are, of course, factors that explain why this is so; one is that the establishment of the executive agency for public health had not yet been completed, and, at the same time, staff were tied up in preparing the new health and consumer protection programme, while 2004’s problems with budget commitments resulted in payment problems in the environmental sector in 2005. Understandable though the explanations given by the Commission’s offices are, the Commission must learn how to anticipate problems before they occur, in order to be able to take immediate action to address them; after all, it is not that lacking in experience of dealing with administrative problems.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are once again debating the future of the own resources. At present we are actually only doing so for the record. The Commissioner responsible is not here, the Council benches are completely empty and the only people that I can see here are the Members with whom I have already spent many hours in the Committee on Budgets discussing Mr Lamassoure’s interim report. We have once again rehearsed all of the arguments that we put forward in 1990, 1994, 2001 and 2005 as the essential points to be considered in a reform of the own resources system. We want a simpler system than the one that we have at present. We want more justice, more equality amongst the Member States, including on the revenue side – no more exceptions please – and we want greater transparency on the revenue side of the budget: transparency for all of Parliament’s Members, for the Members of the Council and above all for all of our citizens. Surely it cannot be so difficult for the Council to endorse these demands itself. We cannot keep getting up on our infamous soapboxes but not move a step closer to our citizens. In addition, of course, this does not make it any easier for the public to understand the European Union’s budget. This is also about being more democratic. The European Parliament, which represents the peoples of Europe, can only help to determine the European Union’s expenditure, but not its revenue. This leads to the rather abstruse situation of the Council denying us our share of responsibility, but at the same time defaming Parliament as a spendthrift parliament, saying that it can only be in favour of increasing expenditure because it is not responsible for revenue and therefore does not have to justify it either. That is not true, some of you will say, but it is! I have experienced it firsthand. Within the space of half an hour both statements came out of one and the same mouth of one and the same finance minister. Parliament is always willing to negotiate on this. We have never been bent on getting our own way regardless. Mr Lamassoure has proved this once again now in his charming way with his very moderate proposal for a two-stage reform of the own resources system. We support him in almost every respect, including in his desire not to encroach on national fiscal sovereignty at present by calling for a European tax. He also – I am happy to admit – has my own personal support, I who have repeatedly said ever since I have been in Parliament: no representation without taxation. As you can see, the European Parliament has already given ground, even before negotiations with the Council have begun. We now expect to see some movement from the Council in the run-up to the jointly agreed revision. The Council should at long last show some cooperation.

 Mr President, before I deliver my speech, I would just like to say to Mr Garriga Polledo that I, too, can look back on 12 years of budget debates in this House and in those 12 years I have never before seen a rapporteur on the Budget, once his own speech was over, simply get up and not listen to what the Members of this House had to say. In the course of a Budget procedure, the European Parliament, being an assembly of politically thinking heads, engages in a certain number of internal debates, but, when it came to the subject of agencies, there were no differences between the various groups; we agreed that cooperation with the agencies had been improved over the last three years, although that does not mean that the good cannot be made better. It is for that reason that we gave the agencies some homework to do before they could make use of all the money allocated to them. They have to send us their work programme with a list of tasks and information as to what has changed since the previous year and why. They are also required to implement the personnel policy guidelines already agreed to. Such are the tasks for the agencies, which they are able to deal with themselves. Others, too, however, need to take action, the Commission for a start, whose function is to promptly – and I emphasise ‘promptly’ – coordinate their personnel plans and put them before us, but also those of us who sit on the specialised committees, who are called upon to evaluate the work of each individual agency by reference to the work programmes, and that has to be done in pretty short order too if the agencies are not to be penalised for something for which they are not responsible, so please let there be no cliquery, and when I say ‘prompt’, I mean that everything has to be sorted out in the first quarter of the following year.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the start of the first financial year of the Financial Perspective that we negotiated in April and adopted in May is almost upon us; the financial framework is a tight one, and presents us with a number of problems as regards the achievement of our policy objectives. The Commission took a very cautious approach to drawing up the preliminary draft budget for 2007, and the Council – as always unperturbed by what the experts might say – cut it even further down to size. The Committee on the Environment tried to save what could be saved by reinstating the figures from the preliminary draft budget and making responsible increases in a few lines. The Committee on Budgets took on board all the Committee on the Environment’s amendments, and for that I am very grateful to my fellow-Members who sit on it. We cannot, however, regard the overall situation as satisfactory, since the financial year 2007 will present us with as yet unresolved problems with LIFE+ and the action programme on health. Agencies are the only area in which we can look forward to the future with optimism on the grounds that they are being properly developed and funded, and by that I mean not only those agencies for which the Committee on the Environment is the competent specialised committee, but all of them, cooperation with which has undergone a marked improvement over the last two years; indeed, the personnel and personnel development plans for them will be in our hands by the end of the year, and I take a positive view of all of them. It has to be said, though, that there are persistent difficulties with the new ones – the Gender Institute, the Human Rights Agency, and the Chemicals Agency – and, contrary to what the Commissioner has just said, these are not of a merely technical nature, for there is as yet no legal basis for any of them. We in this House are still waiting for the start of negotiations with the Council pursuant to Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement – negotiations, that is, on where the money for the three new agencies is to come from. Perhaps the Presidency of the Council might be so good as to move this process along a bit.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which always means that one has to concentrate more on money than on what a report is actually about, and so that – rather than the report’s subject-matter, about which Members have already said everything that needs to be said – is what my opinion is about. We do indeed have a problem with the funding for the European Union’s Agency for Fundamental Rights, which will be a whole new agency, similar to the Chemicals Agency or the Institute for Gender Equality, and will be in place from 2007 onwards, provided that it is agreed to by the time we assume it will be. Now we all know that the Council and Parliament agreed, in paragraph 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May of this year and relating to budgetary discipline and sound financial management agreed by them and the Commission, that the Council and Parliament would be required to discuss the funding arrangements of the new agencies and then come to an agreement on them. As long ago as this July, before the summer recess, the Budget Committee invited the Council to enter negotiations with us – we did so, indeed, on repeated occasions. Since the Council has not, as yet, responded to our invitation, the Committee on Budgets has now, in the course of its deliberations on the coming financial year, renamed the budget line to which the Commission had appended the description ‘Human Rights Agency’ as the budget line for the ‘European Union's Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia’ and created a new one with the annotation ‘for information’. We hope that we will soon have a legal basis and will then be able to come to an agreement with the Council as to how the new agency should be funded.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has put before us a proposal for extending the remit of the Maritime Safety Agency, and it is surely right, and surely makes sense, that the Agency should be allowed to perform operational tasks in combating pollution, for there is no doubt that the agency possesses the know-how required to support – and I emphasise the word ‘support’, for there is no intention that it should replace them in what they do – the Member States in preventing maritime pollution and in dealing with it. If, though, its responsibilities are to be extended in this way, this must go hand in hand with the allocation of the necessary funding for the long term. No agency can do a proper job of work if it does not have enough money. The Commission’s proposal for the sum of EUR 154 million over the seven-year period is very realistic, being based as it is on the experiences gained in 2005 and 2006. It goes back, though, to a time when EUR 58.5 billion more was meant to be allocated to Category 1A. The whole category from which the EMSA is funded was cut down to 71%, although the EMSA is not affected by this cut, as the old amount still applies. Do not misunderstand me: the Committee on Budgets takes the view that the EUR 154 million constitutes the minimum that should be allocated to the EMSA to enable it to cope with its additional functions. We in the Committee on Budgets would have been happy if the members of the lead committee had taken exactly the same view, had supported us in our approach and had incorporated this into the regulation, for our position is that, if the Community fails to allocate sufficient resources, it is doing no more than wasting money.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though the European Union’s Solidarity Fund has been in existence only since 2002, it is already in need of revision. Founded upon the principles of solidarity and aid in a crisis, it has proved its worth in dealing with the after-effects of natural disasters, but it has also become apparent over recent years that its scope cannot be limited to dealing with these. It has become more and more plain that industrial and technological disasters and the potential crises resulting from terrorist acts or – something that is of particular importance to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – a public health crisis, make it necessary that we should be in a position to respond and help by means of solidarity and financial resources. Just so that it is clear to everyone, once and for all, I am not talking here about preventative measures, which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the remit of the Member States. Our concern is with help, on the basis of solidarity, in dealing with the spreading of diseases, with pandemics, or with accidents such as the one that happened at Chernobyl. We want to be able to help without in any way overloading the European budget with unnecessary functions, not even when natural disasters need to be dealt with. It is for that reason that I expect the House not to give its backing to the renewed demand – made in another report – for an observatory to report on drought, desertification and other effects of climate change, for these tasks are already being dealt with by the Commission anyway. It must be clear to us that every additional agency – or whatever else we want to call these things – restricts the financial elbow room available for our policies, and just how tight that elbow room is was the subject of a resolution yesterday.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed the case that we in the European Union need another effective instrument to enable us to take greater strides towards equality for women and men, for if we carry on mincing along in the way we are now, establishing equality will still be a struggle even for our great-grand-daughters. The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians – and we women in particular – want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage. There are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard. Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money. If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too. Secondly, the Commission has proposed – and to this proposal this House has not objected – that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS. In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EUR 850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount. Without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned. Real policy-making and real work require real money if we are not to find ourselves building yet more Potemkin villages, frustrating workers, and throwing sand in the public’s face.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission presented its preliminary draft budget in June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was less than enthusiastic about it. As we see it, the funds provided are simply not adequate to facilitate the proper implementation of European environmental and health policy and our policy on the safety of food. We now have 25 Member States, yet there is to be only less than a 1% increase for environmental matters, and, in public health, no increase whatever beyond the 2005 level. That alone is ridiculous enough in the eyes of some Members, but now the Council has excelled itself by cutting the estimates, which were low enough in any case. In their speeches on television and in public, all the members of the Council talk endlessly about their desire to build a citizens’ Europe. Here in this plenary, we have just heard that there is to be another rise in people’s standard of living in Europe, even though the funding for such a policy is being withheld. Now that really is what I call confidence-building!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall now, for once, use my three minutes to say something basic. I do not propose to go into the vast number of points of detail that many in the House find incomprehensible but which those of us who are involved in this debate understand as a matter of course; I am sure that there will be other Members who will want to discuss them. This directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is a piece of legislation that does not exactly evoke much interest on the part of most of the European public – at any rate, not from those who live in my own country – but that has done nothing to save us from energetic lobbying on the part of interested parties – on the one hand, the unions, the industry and its associations and, on the other, the various environmental and consumer groups. Our drafting of a resolution has been made no easier by the fact that none of them want the same thing all the time – sometimes, indeed, the precise opposite. All the same, I do believe that the Environmental Committee has presented the plenary with a balanced piece of legislation on which to vote, particularly as this Directive is supplementary in character. The Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive largely exclude the extractive industries, the types of waste produced by which do not in fact fit the regulations exactly, in that many of them present no problems in terms of the environment. Legal certainty, though, is a necessity – not only for people and their environment, but also for trading enterprises and for businesses engaged in the extraction of such raw materials as oil, coal, metals, clay, gravel or sand. There are two things that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament always bear in mind: first, the protection of people and the environment, with a sustainable way of doing business, and secondly our enterprises’ need for a proper framework and conditions if they are to be able to do business and create jobs for the people whom we – as I said in my first point – want to protect from harm. Our rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, has been perceptive and rigorous in taking both these principles into account in this proposal for a resolution, and for that, many thanks to him.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the intention is that LIFE + should be the sole financial instrument for the environment from 2007 onwards. It is no bad idea to combine in one single environmental instrument the various programmes that have supported such environmental measures as actions within the scope of the Forest Focus Regulation and supported non-governmental organisations and local and regional authorities. As one who is involved with the budget, I am particularly glad that we can take it as read that this operation will result in greater efficiency and effectiveness. We know that, in order to be effective, energy policy must be implemented at ground level, throughout the EU and on a local basis everywhere. For that reason, although the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are not open to criticism, it is urgently necessary, if we really do want the funding of environmental policy to add indisputable value to Europe, that the use to which the funds are put be effectively monitored. Such monitoring will involve not only codecision by Parliament on the multiannual programmes, but also, and of necessity, evaluation at short intervals, in order to make it possible to make adjustments without delay. The ‘LIFE-Nature’ part has been as good as dropped from the Commission proposal for LIFE, and with it has gone the funding for Natura 2000 measures. That is something we cannot accept. The Commission’s proposal for the management of the Natura 2000 areas to be paid for out of the Fund is no bad idea either in view of what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has seen of the problems inherent in such a modus operandi 
– essentially competition with other objectives laid down in various funds. We eventually came to an agreement that LIFE + should be used to support those Natura 2000 areas that are not covered by one of the funds. It remains to be seen how far this approach, which is at once perceptive, realistic and motivated by solidarity, will get us. Despite this House, yesterday, prompted by the Committee on Regional Development, having struck every single reference to Natura 2000 out of the Structural Funds Regulations, I do expect not only our Committee, but also the NGOs and the Commission, to take the initiative – or go on the offensive – in order to persuade people.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our environment and our natural resources are scarce assets, and we want to pass them on to our children, if at all possible enlarging them in the process. Our budgetary resources are also a scarce asset, and so we must make strenuous efforts to achieve our environmental goals as effectively and efficiently is possible. This is the spirit in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety drafted its opinion, and the rapporteur, in his usual courteous and cooperative manner, has incorporated our thoughts. For that I am grateful to him. These thoughts include not only the observation that European environmental policy has proved to be an effective means of preserving or even improving the environment, public health and people’s quality of life. That is the conservationist side of our approach. Our thoughts also comprise the realisation and recognition that our environmental policy is also making a significant contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon goals, to job creation. That is the innovative side of our approach, and its importance should not be underestimated. For this reason, I very much hope that all Members of this House will join us in our present and future pursuit of this strategic path. (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is not happy, but largely satisfied with the implementation of the 2003 budget in the sphere of the environment, public health and food safety. While noting the Commission’s intention to improve the implementation cycle of multi-annual programmes, we do want it to target its invitations to tender more and to give applicants rather more intensive support. The Commission must, however, stop justifying dilatory implementation by reference to the new administrative and financial provisions. It is a defence that we will no longer accept in future. We believe that the European Environment Agency, the Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and the Food Safety Authority have worked well and intelligently, and we expect more of the same in future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of creating the European Police College as a European Union institution is a goal shared by all of us. If we are to get serious about combating crime in Europe, and if we are to declare war on organised cross-border crime in particular, our police services and law enforcement authorities will need a facility in which they can be trained. If the Police College is to be a European institution, it has to operate in accordance with the European Union’s administrative and budgetary rules, and it is on these latter that the Committee on Budgets has focussed in its opinion for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. For a start, the EUR 4.5 million per annum to be allocated from 2007 onwards is dependent on the new financial framework, which has yet to be adopted. Secondly, we take the view that the Member State in which the College is situated must make a financial contribution to it. Thirdly, its Governing Board can adopt only a provisional establishment plan and draft budget, in any case until such time as Parliament, in December, adopts the overall Budget for the coming year. Fourthly, in the event of justified derogations to the general principles of the Budgetary Regulation, the budgetary authority – that being this House and the Council – must be informed. With their usual fruitful cooperation the Committee – led by the rapporteur – incorporated our amendments into its report, and for that I warmly thank them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by saying, by way of an introduction, that I am fully aware that when acting in your capacity as Environment Commissioner you are following in the tradition of the Commission, a European institution. The comments I am about to make will therefore relate to the Commission, and not to you personally. Firstly, it is my opinion that the reason why this House is having to deal with the problem of Natura 2000 is that the Commission has not had the courage to propose a suitable financial instrument. This is the first point I should like to make; in the Habitat Directive we committed ourselves to cofinancing and to the provision of funding, yet no corresponding provisions have been made in our various funds. Neither, secondly, has the Commission had the courage to ensure that the existing regulations – the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation – contain appropriate stipulations. They are full of ‘can’s’, ‘should’s’ and ‘could’s’, which is by no means adequate, or at least not in our opinion, and indeed we are all aware of where such language gets us. The intention is that regions in the Member States submit operational programmes, and the Commission then assesses and approves them. We are well aware of this, but there is no guarantee that what is written down will actually be read. In the current programming period, for example, the advancement of women’s concerns has been included as a goal in the Structural Funds Regulation, and indeed this was something for which Parliament fought strongly. The Member States, however, have reacted by doing next to nothing, and this is intolerable. It is for this reason that we need a separate instrument to finance Natura 2000, and indeed this House has already agreed that a separate financial instrument is needed; one need only look at the individual committees’ opinions on the Financial Perspective. The Committee on Agriculture has already said that the protection of biodiversity is not a primary or genuine rural development policy. We all know what that means; our agriculture experts do not want to have to use money from rural development funds to pay for Natura 2000 either.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Environment Committee is a committee with significant legislative powers, but it is also a committee with a very small budget, and the only financial instrument for the environment, the LIFE Programme, has had its funding cut yet again in the 2005 budget compared with 2004. We are actually very thrifty. Expenditure under the environment heading is not even 0.25% of the European budget, that is, less than a quarter of 1%. In addition, it is our impression that the Environment DG has insufficient staff to implement the policies that we want. The same applies, incidentally, to the Health and Consumer Protection DG. And when we hear the word ‘health’ of course we all immediately think ‘tobacco’. That is clear. We spend more than EUR 950 million on subsidies to tobacco growers. That is more than five and a half times as much as the entire environment budget. However, we allocate only EUR 14 million to developing alternatives for tobacco growers. This has to change!

 Ladies and gentlemen, much has already been said on the strategy adopted this year by this House with regard to the 2005 Budget. It has also been said that the decentralised agencies play an important role for us in negotiations with the Council. Once again, I should like to make it very clear to everyone that we are not opposed to the agencies; indeed quite the opposite is true, as we believe that most of them make an outstanding contribution to our common European concern. Yet we must be aware of the fact that in recent years the rate at which agencies are established has accelerated considerably. Whereas in 1990 there were only three agencies, in 1995 six and in 2000 seven, and there will be 23 as soon as 2005. We have always supported the Commission’s intention to concentrate on its core competencies and transfer certain areas to the agencies, but we want this to occur in a focused manner and under extremely strict political and budgetary control. The Council is always in favour of creating new agencies, and since the Member States have been represented on agencies’ management boards this has been particularly true, above all in the case of agencies which implement European legislation. In the preliminary draft budget for 2005 EUR 281 303 million is earmarked for agencies, EUR 53.7 million more than in the 2004 financial year. We must, however, bear in mind that all but four agencies are funded under Heading 3, internal policies, where very little money remains. We are therefore left with only two options; either we provide the funding earmarked for the agencies without complaint, and cut funding in other priority budget lines in order to find the money to do so; or we negotiate with the Council in order to increase funding under Heading 3 by the missing EUR 54 million. The latter is exactly what we want to happen. I should now like to address Mrs Schreyer once again, and to thank her, as have all the previous speakers. All the men who have spoken before this House know how to pay compliments much better than I am able to, yet, as you are aware, my thanks are sincere, as Mrs Schreyer has persuaded her fellow Commissioners to put forward proposals which are genuinely forward-looking. In fact, they are so forward-looking that I do not believe that it will be possible to implement them during my time as a Member of this House. You are aware of the proposals to which I am referring, which include the general correction mechanism and the own resources report, with the ‘window to the future’ of an income system intended to undergo successive amendments. This was an extremely courageous feat, and one which none of your predecessors achieved, in any case not the two men who were your immediate predecessors. I would like to offer you my heartfelt thanks for this. Mrs Schreyer, women can do it! (Muted applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a rare event – so much so, in fact, that it highlights the importance of the discussions, the current revisions and the urgent need for action – as this is the very first time that we will have adopted a proposal for a regulation from the European Commission on the structural funds for which there are almost no amendments. I am relieved to find that we are so unanimous in our discussion of this proposal for a regulation from the Commission regarding the European Social Fund, and I would like to thank you all for following my recommendation not to table any amendments in respect of the European Social Fund. It is very clear that the financial and economic crisis demands that we all take responsibility, once again, for the optimum and, above all, rapid qualification of our workers, especially now. More and more people are suffering from the effects that this international financial crisis is having on the labour market. They expect answers from us, they expect protection and, above all, they need answers now and not in a few months’ time. The revision of the European Social Fund Regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately. This will make a significant contribution to reducing the bureaucracy associated with the European Social Fund. The allocation of funds has been made simpler and this will also speed up the disbursement of funds. Application procedures that drag on for months and complicated methods of calculation, which until now were required to prove scheme participants’ eligibility for individual bus and tram tickets, will be a thing of the past. However, sometimes I ask myself why it has taken such a dramatic crisis for us to take this step. Of course, it is never too late and with this revision we are at least ensuring that the funds can be used to the full and hopefully will also very quickly reach those who are most affected in the best possible way. We must enable these people to be reintegrated into the labour market as quickly as possible. They must absolutely not be allowed to slip into a longer period of unemployment, because at the present time it is easy to fall from there into a precarious situation or into poverty. What has changed? Or should I say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow? In future, project applicants will be able to use flat rates in their calculations and also be able to apply for lump sums up to EUR 50 000 for each measure. As for all of you sceptics, I would like to reiterate that checks on the correct allocation of funds will remain in place, as, firstly, both flat rates and lump sums will be determined by the Member States themselves and, secondly, the Commission will examine in advance whether these – and I quote – are fair, equitable and verifiable. The procedure does actually appear to be in order, as, surprisingly enough, our budget controllers had no objections to this regulation. Thus, we are simplifying the procedure. However, we are not changing the main priorities of the European Social Fund. There is no reason at the moment for us to do this, as the project applicants are given sufficient scope to be able to react appropriately themselves to the specific needs of the labour market. Finally, I would like to say that we are also making available to the Member States an increase in advance funds for this year of a further EUR 1.8 billion for training and further training measures and I think that this is a clear signal from this House that we are acting quickly in this crisis and are showing solidarity here. I would like to apologise for the fact that I am unable to stay with this debate to its conclusion, as I now have to attend the Conciliation Committee for the Working Time Directive.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would appeal once more to those in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who are still wavering, in particular, to unite in following the vote of Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and retaining the position from first reading on Wednesday. After all, it is not credible to stand up for the health protection of workers on the one hand and advocate a continuation of the opt-out on the other. Indeed, it was not without reason that the ILO recommended the 48-hour week as far back as 1919. Worker stresses may be different nowadays, but they are no less serious. As I see it, it is pure cynicism – I say this with the Council in mind – to put the retention of the opt-out across as a social achievement merely because a 60-hour ceiling is also being introduced for the average working week. The fact that the agreement of the two sides of industry is to be required only where even longer working hours are concerned amounts to saying that one would be prepared to accept 60 hours a week as normal working hours – and this is surely unacceptable! Following the Council’s lead would mean trampling the health of our workers underfoot and abandoning the precept of reconciling family and work, which would be tantamount to betraying social Europe! Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would entreat you to give this some more thought. As regards on-call time, I would say to the Council that this must be recognised as working time as a general rule. There is no escaping this. Leaving the two sides of industry to evaluate inactive time creates sufficient flexibility for doctors, fire brigades and guard services.

 Mr President, my group and I would also have liked to have seen more than what has now been produced, but I think, nevertheless, that we have achieved a lot and have brought agreement at European level a step further forward. One thing is clear: in future, the European Works Council must be informed and consulted prior to any decision – and that is the important point – prior to any decision being taken regarding restructuring and then it will no longer find out about this via the newspaper. However, I would like to say something very clearly to the Commission: the sort of chaos we saw when determining who is actually negotiating here must not happen again. There must be a clear distinction between the social dialogue and the European Parliament. We sometimes had the feeling that the rights of this House were being nullified. That must not happen in future.
 Karin Jöns  (PSE

 Mr President, in order to bring illegal immigration under control, to meet the challenges represented by demographic change, to increase our competitiveness and, at the same time, to ensure a high level of social harmony, we need a joint immigration policy more urgently than ever. This House is in agreement on this point. For this reason, I would like to thank all four rapporteurs for their close cooperation. However, for my group, a joint immigration policy must include all migrants, otherwise it will fall short of our requirements. This means that the principle of equal treatment must apply to everyone without restrictions, in the case of employees’ rights, access to education and access to social security systems. Therefore, I would ask you to vote in favour of my group’s amendments tomorrow. The Framework Directive must also apply to seasonal workers, refugees or temporary asylum seekers. As far as the Blue Card is concerned, I would like to change the outcome of the vote of the committee responsible tomorrow in order to open up the European labour market not only to migrants from countries with which we already have partnership agreements. There must be no restrictions of this kind and it pleases me to hear that the Commission shares this view. Finally, another word to the Council. In view of the occasion, I urge you to adopt both directives together. If we are serious about equal treatment, we cannot adopt the principles of equal treatment first of all just for highly qualified workers and then later perhaps for other migrants.

 Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets for the fact that they broadly share the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ approach to the budget. Nevertheless, I would like, once again, to make the case for increasing funding for social dialogue appropriately, as we proposed. We cannot keep talking about how social dialogue is a pillar of our European social model, and then on the other hand reduce funding in exactly this area. At this point, I would also call on the Council to work with us to find a solution for the problem of the degressivity clause. It has a particularly dramatic effect on the work of the trade union institutes, and, over the long term, continual funding cuts are simply no longer sustainable. With regard the Committee’s two pilot projects, allow me to say one thing: there was a broad consensus in favour of a pilot project relating to posted workers, and I am sure that the results of this project will bring us important insights for our future political decisions on the Posting of Workers Directive. We will therefore certainly pay close attention to ensure that the Commission, in turn, turns its attention to those aspects that are important to us in this project, to prevent wage dumping and social dumping. The second project relates to violence against the elderly. This project confronts a taboo subject, and this is particularly important.

Mr President, I feel compelled to say that this social agenda leaves me stone-cold. Not a single nettle has been firmly grasped. This surely cannot be a serious attempt to reform European works councils, since it makes no provision for more meetings or for sanction mechanisms in the event of infringements. The absence of any willingness to reform the Posting of Workers Directive is equally unacceptable. Commissioner, the lack of a clear position on working hours in a social agenda is further evidence that this Commission does not baulk at the idea of 65-hour working weeks either. This no longer bears any relation to the European social model to which my group aspires and which we Socialists are seeking to establish. May I also say to the Council that it is intolerable how you are putting management and labour organisations under pressure – to put it politely – over the European works councils. My group will not have any part in this charade. If Europe’s labour force is not to turn its back completely on the European Union, we must afford it better protection from the effects of globalisation and waste no time in paving the way for cross-border collective wage agreements.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it seems that, once again, the Commission is merely paying lip service to the idea of a social Europe. You are responsible for the fact that we still do not have a proposal to reform the works councils, because it is the Commission, and nobody else, that is disregarding the ETUC’s statement that it does not want to enter into negotiations with BUSINESSEUROPE unless they are genuine. You are establishing completely new rules of play, as Article 138 of the Treaty does not provide for a third phase in the consultation process. There has never been such a phase. The Commission’s tactics are obvious – it is stalling for time. Is the Commission really siding with the employers again? Basically, nobody wants substantial reform of the works councils, certainly not before the next European elections. May I remind you that Jacques Delors already presented us with a proposal, just two weeks after the employers had refused to negotiate. You could have done the same. The end of June is far too late, not to mention the fact that a ‘balanced proposal’ means something else.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, closer cooperation between national administrations is, of course, right and proper. I welcome this. It is even essential. However, if we all genuinely want to avert a race for the lowest minimum wage in Europe, we need more, and you know that, too, Commissioner. According to the Rüffert judgment, there is only one solution in my opinion. We have to improve the Posting of Workers Directive. The Commission is also required to do this. We have to draw legislative consequences from this judgment because it reverses the intention of the Posting of Workers Directive. The freedom to provide services is placed higher than the protection of employees here. Even the planned change from minimum to maximum protection is explained. In my country, Germany, 8 out of 16 federal states are directly affected by this judgment. The regional governments just wanted to serve as models here on wage dumping matters. Based on the Posting of Workers Directive as well as on the procurement directives, they wanted to ensure compliance with certain social criteria, at least when awarding public contracts. They have therefore demanded compliance with local standard wage rates as a social criterion, since these are above the minimum wage. It is difficult for me to understand the decision of the Court of Justice. If we really want social criteria – and I think we all want this – then it must be possible to achieve even more than a minimum wage. The judgment should not entrap us into continuing to authorise minimum standards alone in future for posted workers. This is not the social Europe that my group wants. To be on the safe side, we also need to examine the procurement directives carefully. Back in Germany, the judgments of the European Court of Justice on employment addressed this evening have created a back flash in Europe’s acceptance. We are all now being asked to change tack again here.

Madam President, Commissioner, the media in my country are noting Germany’s successful record on mammography screenings. Once again the EU guidelines on quality assurance have proved their worth. However, demands are already being made to offer this to younger women as well. This shows how important European guidelines are. Therefore, in its motion for a resolution, too, this House will tomorrow be calling for the further development of evidence-based EU guidelines on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of all widespread cancers and the formulation of an urgently needed accreditation and certification procedure for relevant facilities. Criteria on their own are not enough here. Only in this way will we manage to put quality above populism and above class and market interests when it comes to the early detection and treatment of cancer. I would ask all my fellow Members – and the Commissioner, too – to continue to persuade and bring on board the Member States still doubting the need for an accreditation procedure.

 Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, I am much obliged to the Commission for the initiatives and to Mrs Lynne for her most excellent report. Anyone who wants to combat poverty – as Mr Fatuzzo has already said – must really focus more intensely on the older generation. We must stay abreast of demographic changes and also ensure, despite steadily rising costs in the health system, that it will be just as possible to age with dignity in the future. Older people have just as much right to comprehensive, quality-assured health care and long-term care regardless of their income or where they live. We urgently need a targeted exchange of experience amongst Member States as to how best to organise and secure high-quality, affordable care. In particular, we must take into account the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from dementia. However, to do this, we need sound data; that is also why we are asking the Commission to provide us with these data as quickly as possible. In a social Europe, all patients must have equal access to evidence-based medicines and medical products. It is simply unacceptable that the very same antibiotic costs EUR 3 in Belgium and EUR 34 in Germany, for example. Therefore I am glad that, with this report, we are calling for the Commission and the Member States to enter into intensive dialogue with us, and with the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups, in order to develop balanced guidelines for greater transparency as far as the effectiveness and price of medicines are concerned. This is another contribution to reducing the costs of health care for us all.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, wish to express my sincere thanks to Mr Piecyk for his really excellent report. I hail from a region with a deeply rooted maritime tradition. Overfishing of the seas and the bankruptcy of several shipyards has led to an unemployment rate of up to 20%. Nevertheless, shipbuilding is now taking place again. Instead of fish processing, biotechnology is the order of the day. Wind farms are being increasingly located offshore. Climate research is taking pride of place. This is the result of major investment, not only in research and innovation, but also in training. We must do more to promote training in maritime occupations, in order to create good, sustainable jobs. The growth potential for the next five years alone is estimated at approximately 15%, and I am pleased that Mr Piecyk’s report, unlike the Commission Green Paper, makes this a clear priority. In conclusion, I would appeal to all my fellow Members to support the amendment tabled by my group that seeks to put an end to the continued treatment of seafarers as second-class workers. The European minimum standards in labour law must apply unreservedly to them, too.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten very warmly on her excellent work. We simply cannot require workers to show increasing flexibility in the labour market and at the same time ask them to do more to provide for their own retirement, without giving many of them an opportunity to acquire occupational or supplementary pension rights. Around 20% of workers are now only offered temporary job contracts. As the Commissioner has already said, 40% now spend less than five years working for the same company. Against this background, describing occupational pensions as rewards for loyalty, as is the case in my country for example, is nothing short of cynical. The timing of the provisions urgently needs to be improved. Anyone who wants to keep long vesting periods and on top of that exclude dormant rights from the scope of the directive altogether, while at the same time delaying the entry into force of such an impoverished directive until 2018, has still not arrived in the real world. I actually wanted to say all of this to my fellow Member Mr Mann, but he has already left the Chamber. It is surely no accident that the positions of the Commission and Parliament are so close here. Our population is ageing and we have to act accordingly. In my country in 1970, for example, for every pension there were still eight people in work, but in 2030 there will only be two. That is why we urgently need to slam on the brakes. We must make it possible for all workers to have a genuine opportunity to make proper provision for their retirement themselves. Obviously employers must bear part of the responsibility. You cannot tell me that the rules that we are proposing – as they stand in the Oomen-Ruijten report – are going to drive umpteen thousand companies into bankruptcy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, uncertainty is always a bad thing, especially when it relates to the future of jobs. The sword of Damocles that being laid off represents has been hanging over the heads of thousands of Airbus employees since January. That is an intolerable situation. It is no way to treat human beings. In my constituency there was talk, with the advent of Power8, first of 1 200 job losses, then of 700, then of job losses solely amongst temporary workers and now we hear that Airbus actually wants to start hiring again! All of this cannot fail to make one dizzy. The approach taken by the top management at EADS is, as we all know, no longer an isolated incident. We have heard this a number of times today. The fact that something like this occurs despite the European Works Council Directive is simply scandalous and makes it glaringly evident that action is needed. For that reason, there is an urgent need to introduce specific measures to provide a stronger reminder to employers of their obligations in terms of informing and consulting with their employees. We must ensure, above all, that sanctions against contravention of the directive are rigorously enforced right across the EU and also that employees and their representatives are represented on the supervisory boards. Commissioner Špidla, I genuinely expect the Commission finally to get on with the long overdue task of updating this directive, for, as is well known, the EU’s competitiveness and productivity stand and fall by good, safe jobs.
 Karin Jöns (PSE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, full order books and its position as Boeing’s competitor for the number one spot on the global market testify to the high level of skills of Airbus’ employees and to their identification with their product. It is not the workers who are responsible for the mistakes that have been made; they have done a very good job, and are continuing to do so. The European aerospace industry will not, in the future, be able to do without this know-how – derived from France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany – any more than it has been able to in the past. Developing and assembling the wings for high-tech aircraft – which is what Airbus does in Bremen, where I live – calls for special skills. You cannot simply speed ahead regardless in an aeroplane. What we are dealing with here is grave failures of management. The failure of highly-paid managers to look far ahead cannot be a reason for sites to be played off against each other, which is what is happening now. Nor is it acceptable that Airbus should fail to give either its workers or the European Works Council plausible explanations of its decisions. To me, this makes it plain yet again just how urgent is the need for a revision of the directive on European Works Councils; it is overdue, to say the very least. I will also say once more to Mr Hintze that it is not acceptable that development times for new air technology be cut arbitrarily, and those who rely on market considerations alone will pay a bitter price for it.

 Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur. Social services of general interest are a core element in the social Europe. Being part of public services of general interest, they are meant to ensure that someone in need of support or help actually gets it, and, moreover, irrespective of where they live or of what they earn. Social services must not only be generally accessible and affordable, but also of particularly high quality, for – as has already been pointed out – they are personal and serve the common good, and that is why they must not be exposed to unfettered competition. What is needed instead is particular protection for them and for competition to be put within an unambiguous legal framework. What I would like to do right now is just to point out – taking the care of the aged as an example – that demographic change is presenting us with ever greater challenges. After all, in our society, everyone ought not only to have the right to, and a claim on, a dignified old age, but also the certainty of enjoying one.

 Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the chairmen of the three committees, Mrs Záborská, Mr Florenz and Mr Andersson, most warmly for their fantastic cooperation in preparing this debate. I would also like to thank you, Madam President. Breast cancer was on the agenda three years ago, and it is now time to take an initial look at the results, which appears to be urgently necessary. In the 25 Member States, 275 000 women contract breast cancer every year. The risk of dying from it is twice as high in one Member State as in another. To make it worse, younger and younger women are contracting the disease: just in the last few years, the number of women under 40 affected has doubled. Breast cancer is still the number one cause of death in women between 35 and 55. However, I am also shocked at how radical treatment still is in many Member States. In some countries, mastectomies are still the rule rather than the exception, even in the very early stages of the disease, even though in 80% of cases these days it is possible to operate without removing the breast. As you can see, then, we are progressing at a snail's pace. This is particularly true in the new Member States, where the missed opportunities and deficiencies throughout the chain of care are at their worst. However, at least in the old Member States, the fact that the structures remain, as before, inadequate to catastrophic has less to do with public budget problems than with the economic and class interests of the doctors. Let us begin with early detection: the development of an across-the-board breast screening programme according to EU guidelines will involve a one-off cost for the public purse of no more than EUR 1.25 per citizen. I am therefore sure that nobody in this House wants to claim that this money is not available. If we had an EU-wide breast screening programme, we could save the lives of 31 000 women in the EU a year, help to reduce healthcare costs and substantially reduce subsequent costs for the whole of society. To date, though, only 11 countries have a quality-assured screening programme, and these programmes are a long way from being continuous. In your country, too, Mr Špidla, you must put a stop to the practice of passing off opportunistic screening as EU screening. In Cyprus, too, Mr Kyprianou, progress is still very sluggish. Now we know, of course, that you are both on our side, but it would nonetheless have been nice to have the Commission's progress report now, instead of in the Spring, which is when it is expected. We also call on you to put greater emphasis on the option of using money from the Structural Funds to develop a screening programme. However, even the best early detection system is of no use if subsequent treatment is inadequate or inappropriate. Time and again, breast cancer is operated on and treated in hospitals with barely any experience. I would therefore specifically like to thank the Commission for the EU guidelines for breast centres, which we have received from you since last year. The ball is now in the Member States' court, though, because the only place in the whole of the EU with such centres at the moment is – amazingly – the United Kingdom. That is why we will also call today, in our joint resolution, for the Member States to establish sufficient breast centres nationwide by 2016. This is absolutely feasible by 2016. We would need around 1 800 such centres EU-wide. Then all women would have the opportunity to get the same optimum treatment, regardless of where they live. In order to ensure that these breast centres actually work in accordance with the EU criteria, that they really do perform a minimum number of operations on primary breast cancer, namely 150 a year in a single centre, that the specialists really have specialised exclusively in benign and malignant breast diseases and that they really do carry out interdisciplinary consultations before and after the operation for each case of breast cancer, we now also need guidelines for the certification of breast centres. In this connection, we would call on you in the Commission to embark on drafting these guidelines with real speed. We would also ask you to draw up guidelines for the job description of breast nurses, who have a very important role to play in these centres, as guides and mediators between doctors and patients throughout the treatment process. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that was a very important debate, and a very good one, for we have shown once more that this House really does stand alongside women suffering from breast cancer, and their families too. We are, by the way, as far as I am aware, the only legislature in the European Union to mark the international month of breast cancer by debating structural improvements in the treatment and early diagnosis of breast cancer. Today, while I would like to extend thanks to the Commission for having given us an undertaking that it will devise a certification procedure for interdisciplinary breast centres and for specialist nurses in the field, I have to tell the Commissioners that we really would be pleased if they were to put these guidelines on the web, which would not be an over-hasty thing to do in this era of modern communication, and that we have not given up the hope of their putting the existing guidelines on sale in something other than book form alone. This debate, though, has, for the first time, put the spotlight on a completely new angle, that being the question of how to deal with women with breast cancer in the work environment and their reintegration into the labour market, and calls have been made for a campaign to make employers aware of these issues. Commissioner Špidla has today – if I understand him rightly – promised us one, and many thanks to him for that. This highlights how important it is that there should be a charter of rights for people with chronic illnesses at work, and I think that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be concerning itself with that issue. Let me close by observing that the answer, to those who have no idea how to deal with breast cancer patients, is that they should be treated in exactly the same way as those suffering from other cancers; they should not be stigmatised – which is, unfortunately, something that still happens – but should, quite simply, be treated entirely normally, which will probably do them the most good.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a happy outcome is worth waiting for; we will, today, be adopting the European Union’s biggest-ever action programme in the fields of employment and social policy. As its name indicates, PROGRESS stands for progress and social solidarity, and that is why this House saw it as important that it should be rolled out, as planned, at the beginning of January 2007, and that is what we are, by this vote, going to be able to do, now that the Council has accommodated our wishes. I therefore want to thank all those who have played a part in making PROGRESS what it now is, namely a really comprehensive and, above all, well-funded strategic instrument that really can put the fight against unemployment, poverty and social exclusion on a more sustainable footing. I must, though, also reiterate my thanks to our budget specialists from all the groups, who, in the trialogue negotiations, had a hard-won fight to get PROGRESS’ funding increased by almost 20%, which amounts to doing the impossible. It was, in the past, repeatedly lamented that the previous multiannual programmes – which addressed the labour market, social integration, anti-discrimination and equality of opportunity – would not be enough to actually push through our social agenda in the way it had been planned for, that is to say, to facilitate a real and rapid exchange of political approaches, concepts and measures among the Member States and to bring them together in developing further indicators and more effective measures. It was agreed that what was more needed was an exchange that was organised differently and better structured, together with more rigorous cooperation, and it is precisely this approach that PROGRESS takes, and it does so by not merely bringing the existing programmes together, but also by improving the structures of cooperation and involving policy-makers at all levels. This, for example, involves the promotion of networking and mutual learning not only at the European level, but also across borders, and at the national, regional, and local levels. I am very glad that we eventually managed to persuade the Commission and the Council to continue fostering cross-border sharing of experiences, for where else are we going to get the European added value for which we are constantly crying out? In order, though, to circulate more rapidly the results of studies and analyses, experience gained and best practice, there will also, in future, be a forum tasked with the evaluation and implementation of the social policy agenda, which will also be involved in the further development of strategies and the setting down of new priorities. I also see it as vitally important that we succeeded in giving the social partners and non-governmental organisations a considerably bigger role than the Commission had originally envisaged, so that they are now involved in the constructive monitoring and further development of the strategies rather than being limited in their functioning to merely pursuing the European objectives. We have also extended Parliament’s influence, in that we are fully involved not only in implementation but also in evaluation, with, for the first time, the Commission’s reports on implementation being sent not only to the programme committee but also to us. Finally, I would like, in particular, to thank Commissioner Špidla, without whose support we would not have managed to incorporate in all language versions the concept – which is in fact more than a mere concept – of gender mainstreaming, as satisfactorily as we have now done.

 Mr President, Mr Špidla, Mrs Hübner, the fact that the Commission and the Council have accepted most of Parliament’s amendments on Social Fund reform really shows how well this House has worked. That we have also in the end reached a good compromise on all the points in dispute also shows how well the Austrian Council Presidency conducted the negotiations. All 25 states can be well and truly satisfied with the results of this reform. Initial and further training and retraining in promising occupations will continue to be supported in the future. But support is also given for the first time for finding better ways of reconciling family and working life, because, as we all know, we need to do more than just provide enough crèche and after-school care places if we want to get more women into work. What we need are new ways of working and new forms of support that are quite specifically geared to this. However, there also needs to be a closer link with European employment strategy, and social exclusion must be curtailed. In view of the 20 million unemployed and 68 million people living in poverty in the European Union as a whole, particular attention will in future also be paid to the integration of socially disadvantaged groups. The same is true for people with disabilities and now, at the insistence of this House, also for asylum seekers and not only for recognised refugees. At this point, it should also be pointed out that it will of course in future again also be possible to have projects to combat xenophobia and racism in training establishments and at the workplace. However, a sound general education is a basic prerequisite for good vocational training, and for that reason money from the Social Fund may now also be used to reform education systems. And for the new Member States I think it is particularly important that we have included the strengthening of the social dialogue and hence of the social partners. In future, no one will be able to steal away secretly, experience speaks for itself. Acceptance has been higher where the social partners have been tangibly involved in the development of employment programmes. (The President cut off the speaker)

 – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am opposed to second-class EU membership, and, yes, there must be freedom of movement for all workers in the EU, and as soon as possible, but there are reasons why the option was introduced of using the 2+3+2 rule to limit access to national labour markets, and it strikes me as pretty risky to attempt to draw from the experiences of three Member States conclusions that automatically apply to all the others. I greatly respect Mr Őry, and will say to him quite frankly that I well understand why he, and many other Members of this House, endorses the Commission’s line, but perhaps I might also say that it was the Czech minister of labour, among others, who announced, as long ago as the end of last year, that even his own country was giving thought to the possibility of making transitional periods for worker mobility applicable to Romania and Bulgaria. In contrast to the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland, Germany’s unemployment rate is running at 12% rather than a mere 5%. We have a country with 18% unemployment right on our own doorstep. I am sure it is understandable that that fact cannot do other than cause many workers to worry about their own jobs, and it is surely only right that a government should try to take that into account, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that Germany has already, in percentage terms, given the most work permits to citizens of the new Member States.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that demographic change represents one of the greatest challenges of the present day for all the Member States of the EU. However, demographic change should also be seen as an opportunity to achieve a new solidarity across the generations, which guarantees young people a good education, creates jobs for all and enables people to grow old with dignity. A very important step towards this would be to introduce impact on demographic change into the mainstream of all policy fields at both national and European level. That should also hold true for the work of the Commission. Furthermore, this is another field in which we should learn more from one another, and intensify the exchange of experiences not only among governments but also among the social partners. These make a vital contribution to the distinguishing feature of the European social model, namely social solidarity. That is why I welcome the call for Member States to enter into new partnerships with the social partners, and also the call for the social partners to be consulted without delay on the balance between family and working life.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to sincerely thank Mr Trakatellis for his excellent report. It is in fact very difficult to do the greatest possible justice to all legitimate interests here while at the same time remaining cogent. I therefore regret, for example, that cancer is no longer explicitly mentioned as a priority in the new health action programme. You are more than right, however, Mr Trakatellis, to point out in your report that there must of course also be sufficient resources for all the objectives we have set ourselves. At present we are a long way from that, however, not to mention the fact that we shall today be rejecting the Commission proposal for a joint action programme for health and consumer protection as totally unacceptable. In health policy, too, the public wants more protection from Europe, not less. Health policy takes fourth place among the European policy priorities you mention. That itself makes it a matter of urgency that health should be given its own action programme again. I cannot understand how even the Commission could propose such a low budget allocation or how the Council could cut it still further. We are therefore trying to remedy two cardinal errors here today. We want two separate programmes, and we want more money. I am saying that primarily to the Council. If the further reduction you want were to become reality, it would mean we only had one third of the previous funding for what will be 27 states. That would mean, however, that we would be completely unable to provide primary and secondary prevention of certain diseases or the urgently necessary protection against the risks of disease occasioned by globalisation.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pension policy, poverty reduction, and health and long-term care are key tasks for us and key issues for all citizens of the EU. Parliament must therefore considerably increase its involvement in open coordination in all aspects of social protection and social inclusion. The current procedure is totally unacceptable. The state of affairs we are discussing today is already outdated. The Council has already discussed the Commission’s follow-up communication. For this reason, an interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed. The Commissioner has said today that he is committed to a dialogue with Parliament. I am most obliged to him for this, but we do not want just a relaxed dialogue; what we really want is the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement laying down crystal-clear rules. Furthermore, in future, the issues of the reconciliation of professional and family life should increasingly be dealt with, and particular attention paid to childcare, within the framework of the open method of coordination in the field of social protection.

 The Commission proposal for a services directive aimed at social dumping and deregulation. I am glad that my Group has succeeded in turning this directive into its precise opposite. The country-of-origin principle has been dropped, to be replaced by market access without discrimination. The labour laws of the place where the services are performed are to apply. It is also significant that the directive on the posting of workers continues to apply without restriction and that there is a derogation for temporary work through agencies. It is now for the Council to desist from further blocking European legislation on this subject. Although I am glad that the directive no longer applies to services of general interest, I do find it regrettable that services of general economic interest are still subject to it to some degree. We urgently need a European framework directive to lay down rules in this important area. As the legislative process continues, a number of aspects will need attention. The fundamental freedoms of workers, as defined in the EU’s ‘Monti clause’, will need to take precedence over the rules of business life. The rights of codecision and codetermination, being founded upon the law, must not be undermined. Due regard shall consistently be had to the legitimate interests of the common good, as defined by Article 4.7a in conformity with the jurisprudence of the ECJ. Legally founded obligations in the interests of workers from a given country and from elsewhere (mandatory contributions to trade associations, holiday funds, etc.) must apply equally to those performing services both at home and across frontiers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this, today, really is the last time we will be discussing this directive, which has prompted so much public debate in my own country. Rarely, if ever before, have I known such distortion of what a directive is all about, and so I would like to go over once again why we Social Democrats eventually, in the course of the conciliation process, decided that we would rather leave natural radiation out of the directive altogether. We came to that decision simply and solely because we want the minimum standards that we lay down for health protection in the workplace to be applied equally and across the board in all the Member States. Where social policy is concerned, we do not want an à la carte 
Europe, which is what the outcome of the second reading would have given us, a Europe in which each and every Member State could decide for itself whether or not to oblige employers to inform their workers about the potential hazards of natural radiation. Even though the references to natural radiation have been removed from the directive, the framework directive is still in place and still obliging employers to protect workers from the hazards of sunlight. That has been confirmed to us not only by this House’s own legal services, but also by those of the Commission and the Council. The only thing we wanted was to give this obligation more concrete form, and, painful though it is, the conservatives and liberals in this House must now face up to the fact that it was they who made this impossible. The consequence of that is that employers are still uncertain of where they stand, legally speaking, as regards whether they need to take steps to protect workers from hazardous natural radiation, and, if so, what action they need to take. The bottom line is that the majority in this House has relinquished to the European Court of Justice the right to shape policy, and that really is very much to be regretted.

 The fact that members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have rejected paragraph 10 of the Svensson report or abstained from voting has to do with differing interpretations of the UN Resolution to which it refers and to the unfortunate fact that it was not possible, in the course of preparatory deliberations, to deal with the differences between versions of the report in different languages. In my capacity as the PSE Group’s shadow rapporteur, and in order to prevent misunderstandings, I would therefore like to make this clarificatory statement: It goes without saying that, if any person in my group rejects paragraph 10 or abstains from voting on it, it does not mean that he or she is in favour of human cloning. We unreservedly endorse UN Resolution A/59/516/Add 1 (‘Declaration on Human Cloning’), which states that practices contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning, must not be permitted. As we do not want to tolerate such things under any circumstances, it is more specifically demanded in the German version that ‘human cloning shall be excluded from support and funding under European Union programmes’. This demand is made explicitly in the future tense, as the intention is that such practices should never be permissible in the EU and that it should of course never be possible to fund them surreptitiously. It is regrettable that versions in many languages – English, French and Swedish among them – give the impression that we are today allowing EU programmes to promote the cloning of humans. That is self-evidently not the case, and for that reason, we have not agreed to paragraph 10 of the report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard again today, there is still a lack of any gender-specific health policy in Europe. That is why the report by Mrs Svensson is so important, and I am much obliged to her for it. It is really no longer acceptable that most medicinal products are still tested only on men – another fact which has already been mentioned – even though we know that biological factors mean that medicinal products work differently on men and women. It is also no longer acceptable that, for example, more women than men die of heart attacks, because the differing symptoms that occur in women mean that the condition is not diagnosed in time. It is equally incomprehensible, in my opinion, that there is still a complete absence of references to any gender-specific reactions in instruction leaflets for medicines. My group fully supports this report, therefore, as it requires Member States to finally take gender-specific health policy seriously. Many of the demands put forward in this report are not new. This just goes to show how slowly the wheels of bureaucracy turn in the Member States. Although EU guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer in women aged between 50 and 69 have been in place since 1992, comprehensive mammography screening exists in only nine Member States. This can reduce mortality by 35%. This report also calls for screening for women from the age of 40, subject to the availability of evidence-based data, as there are early indications that mortality can be reduced here, too, by up to 20%. Another issue we regard as important is that of chlamydia infection. This disease leads to female infertility in one third of cases, where it has not been diagnosed in time. Further data on this are urgently needed. By way of conclusion, I should like to draw attention briefly to a development that is going completely unnoticed by the public. Although Caesarean operations present an increased health risk to mother and child, the number of such operations is rising dramatically in several States. Causes seem to range from hospital doctors’ duty rosters, to supplementary income from private patients, to parents requesting particular appointment dates: holiday planning plays a major part in this. Therefore, my group supports the call – addressed to Member States, in the first instance, of course – for attention to be drawn explicitly to the health risks of Caesareans to mother and child, which are five times greater than with natural births. However, we also support the call for the Commission to further study this phenomenon and gather and pass on the relevant data. We also welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to take every possible step to ensure that women finally receive a full explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of hormone replacement therapy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my own country, we have, for several weeks, had to watch CDU/CSU parliamentarians making a truly grotesque attempt at using this directive on optical radiation for their own purposes in the German election. The amendment tabled by Mr Ferber and Mr Nassauer, with its aim of rejecting the Common Position as a whole, now marks the climax of this campaign, and it is truly a sad sight. One might have expected an amendment like this from the British Tories, but not from the CDU/CSU; with it, these Members are expressing their opposition to workplace protection in the EU as a whole, and it has to be said that their putting it up for grabs also runs counter to their former position on workplace protection. The CDU/CSU voted in favour of all three of the other workplace protection directives; it supported all of them. Can someone perhaps explain to me why they want to improve the protection of workers in the workplace from hazards arising from vibration, noise and electromagnetic radiation, but not from those resulting from optical radiation? To Mrs Weisgerber I have to say that anyone who refers, in the title of their press release, to a ‘sunshine directive’, is consciously aiming to misinform. You are well aware, Mrs Weisgerber, that this directive is primarily concerned with protection from artificial radiation, but you have nothing to say about that; instead, you take natural radiation and fabricate a bogeyman, hypocritically prating about being close to the citizens. All this is obliging employers to inform their workers about the health risks associated with sunlight, a point reiterated with great clarity by our PSE Group’s two amendments. Whether – and, if so, how – the workers protect themselves again the sun’s rays in practice is still left to them alone to decide. The handing out of notice sheets is surely not too much to ask. In the past, doing that sort of thing got a lot done on the workplace protection front. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also want to allow the Member States to define their own specific criteria for how the risk assessment is to be carried out. That does indeed take proper account of subsidiarity, but what we Socialists cannot go along with is à la carte
 workplace protection in Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like at the outset to reiterate my thanks to my fellow-members of the Committee for their constructive cooperation, but would also like to thank the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective, which has played a substantial part in ensuring, not only that PROGRESS is now a good instrument for the better implementation of the social policy agenda, but also that we will have enough money to be able to really ensure greater sustainability. PROGRESS represents a response to the results of the Eurobarometer surveys, for what the public wants is greater involvement on the part of the EU in the combating of unemployment and poverty. For that, though, a primary requirement is for well-organised and structured sharing of experience, with it being particularly necessary that we should promote to a far greater degree the process of learning from one another, whether by supporting European networks, setting in motion Europe-wide studies and analyses or even by means of conferences. This is the only way in which we will succeed in maintaining, in future, the highest possible level of social protection throughout Europe, on which, after all, the maintenance of a peaceful society and social cohesion in the European Union depends. That is something that the Member States now, at last, appear to have realised. Let me now turn to the Commission proposal, to which we have proposed a range of improvements and additions. The improvements primarily have to do with an increase in the overall appropriations and certain changes to the way in which they are distributed among the various areas targeted. What this boils down to is that we have now voted PROGRESS EUR 225 million more than the Commission originally allocated it, and I might also mention that this sum takes estimated inflation into account. There was one of the fields to which the PROGRESS programme applies for which we, together with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, had to fight particularly hard, and that was gender mainstreaming. Without wanting to reopen old wounds, I have to say that I am firmly convinced that, if there are in future to be no more officially free-standing action programmes to promote equality of opportunity, reinforcing this in all areas to which the programme relates and measures taken under it is what is needed to win over the Women’s Committee. Moreover, our Committee was not prepared to accept the cuts in the resources set aside for gender mainstreaming that the Council and the Commission sought. We are reversing many of these cuts, but, rather than taking the money away from other important target areas, we have done this by voting to make the very high flexibility margin of 10% less rigid and thus make it possible for the share allocated to gender equality to be increased by 4% to its present 12% share of the budget for PROGRESS. The Committee also regards five points in this programme as being particularly important, and I expect the Commission to support us in this. For a start, we want to make the individual target areas more visible, which means that the programme committee needs to have five sub-committees, and also needs to organise for each target area an annual exchange of views on the way in which the programme is put into effect, enabling each of these committees to join with the specialist committees in this House in debating it. Secondly, we want the transnational exchange to be maintained in future, for that alone will provide Europe with the added value that we want, and, thirdly, we want PROGRESS to help to really get the experience gained from the programme circulated among the Member States faster than the current programmes have done. We in this Parliament do of course now want – and this is my fourth point – to be more closely involved in monitoring the programme. As I see it, the mere fact that the programme is to run for seven years makes this an absolute necessity. We therefore believe that the distribution of the annual funding around the individual target areas should not be a responsibility for the programme committee but rather a matter for the Budget procedure each year. That brings me to my last point, the role of the social partners and non-governmental organisations. The Committee found the Commission’s desire to limit their role to no more than the pursuit of the EU’s objectives incomprehensible. We regard their involvement in the ongoing development of strategies as indispensable. The possibility of participation in PROGRESS must also be open to national and regional non-governmental organisations. It therefore follows that the maximum co-funding should continue to stand at 90% and not at something like 80%, which would be a cause of major difficulties to many EU networks. (Applause)

 Speaking in my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to point out that the Commission proposal covers all the categories referred to in Article 13, including, that is to say, the groups discriminated against on the grounds of their ethnic origin. The fact is, then, that PROGRESS will also give attention to the particular problems of the Roma. I find it a shame that nothing was said in the Committee about whether or not there should be explicit reference to them, for otherwise we would have had the time to discuss this there. Including a new group at this point creates problems, for we ought then, in fact, to keep on mentioning the other affected groups separately; so far, we have made specific reference only to people with disabilities. We should leave it at that rather than starting to include individual groups; Article 13 should continue to apply. I might add, by the way, that it was my group that, when we voted in June, stated that we would pay special attention in this programme to the problems faced by the Sinti and Roma. In view of all this, I shall abstain from voting.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, of course, would like to thank Mr Bowis for his splendid report, which will enable us to counter, yet again, the widespread prejudice according to which Europe does not care about its citizens’ actual worries and needs. While the public, without a doubt, fear unemployment, they also worry about not always getting the best possible treatment when ill and away from home. Anywhere in Europe, anyone can have an accident, become ill and need medical help and treatment, and so it cannot be acceptable that only two thirds of Member States should have their own legislation on the protection of patients in place. In my own country, for example, 90% of what patients are entitled to is founded upon widely-dispersed case law, none of which is summarised in a single, comprehensive and binding document. It is past high time for current patients’ rights and minimum standards to be brought into line across the EU. Everyone – irrespective of whether it is in Spain, Latvia or Poland that they fall ill – must have the same rights as they do in France, Finland or the Czech Republic, for example the right to expert advice that they can understand, the right to documentation relating to treatment and the right to see their patient records. What we also need, though, is greater transparency in the reimbursement of costs. Even though the ECJ has shed light on which of the costs incurred abroad are reimbursed, Regulation 1408/71 is still unequally applied. The existing legislation on reimbursement of costs needs to be approximated, and there is an urgent need for a single legal framework on patient mobility. The Internet health portal announced by the Commission also needs to be put in place as soon as possible to carry all the important information that is needed not only by patients and their families, but also by professionals – including such things as data on the fields in which hospitals and doctors specialise, as well as data enabling doctors’ performances to be evaluated and data on patient safety. One might say that what we need is a Europe-wide ranking of the kind that exists here and there at national level. If people are to make sound decisions on where and how they want to be treated, they have to be well informed, and one in every four Europeans already uses the Internet as a source of health information. Let me conclude by pointing out that we must not limit Centres of Reference to the treatment of rare illnesses; they are also needed to deal with all the other conditions that require a particular combination of resources and expertise, such as cancer, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. In a Europe in which patients are mobile, there will be a need for more legal certainty, transparency and even greater quality. Subsidiarity notwithstanding, this gives us our great opportunity to enable Europe itself to do much, much more for its citizens. Let us follow where Mr Bowis’ report leads in working towards this end.
 Karin Jöns (PSE

 Madam President, I shall be concentrating on on-call time. I do so because many Members are wondering why it is that this appears to be a particular problem in Germany, where the owners of hospitals are up in arms against the change proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, just as they once were against the rulings by the ECJ. So, for the sake of clarification, let me explain that the ECJ’s ruling has been implemented in Germany, too, since 2004, when German law began to treat the whole of on-call time as working time, in precisely the same way that Mr Cercas’ report demands. Secondly, in practice, too, this can be done without too much difficulty, as is demonstrated by a study to which even the German Minister for Health has referred. I might add that, in Germany, there has been funding available since 2003 for the introduction of much-needed innovative models of working time and for the recruitment of some new doctors. Even then, there can be problems, but it is for that very reason that our Committee wants the opening clause, which would state that alternative arrangements could be made by collective agreement – and only in an emergency by law – to make allowance for the inactive periods. The problem is not the European Working Time Directive; the problem is German hospitals’ aversion to reform. For example, one German region, while being much smaller than Sweden, has far more hospitals and hospital beds. The issue with on-call time is the safety of the patients. Even though staying awake for a period of 24 hours is equivalent, in terms of its adverse effects, to having a blood-alcohol level of 1 per thousand, doctors often work over 30 hours at a stretch, and that is what must be changed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having myself once drafted a report on this subject, I am of course particularly pleased by the considerable continuity that is still evident between Mr Cabrnoch’s report and our previous resolutions. For that, I would like to say how grateful I am to him. The Council’s eventual agreement, in October of last year, to the use of open coordination in health provision and the care of the elderly is another success chalked up by this House. I am confident that the PROGRESS programme, on which I am the rapporteur, will soon provide us with an instrument for organising the exchange of best practice, which is so urgently needed, and for pushing through a reciprocal and mutual process of learning from one another. At the end of the day, the Member States need to be helped to undertake reforms aimed at modernising and strengthening health systems, in which process particular importance must be attached to social cohesion and the principle of solidarity. If the Member States want to ensure, in future, continued universal access to their systems for health care and the care of the elderly, to guarantee their quality and secure their funding, what is needed above all is more prevention and greater transparency. Transparency is itself indispensable if quality is to be maintained and if the resources available to the healthcare systems are to be used in the best possible way. Assessing the quality of medical services must be made much easier; paying out large sums of money for poor-quality service must come to an end. Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and they must be more involved in future decisions on health policy. All the Member States wanted to go further by adopting a Patients’ Law or Patients’ Charter. They all also face major challenges where the care of the elderly and long-term care are concerned. We should join together in seeking strategies for improving the interaction between healthcare provision and treatment, in order to be able to improve care for patients in their homes and to provide sufficient care facilities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commissioner has said has not, in fact, persuaded me; I still have the impression that the Commission, by the decision it took last June, really was in breach of the agreement arising out of the 1997 trialogue. As far as I am aware, this House was given no advance information about this either, and it is pretty dubious that the decision to dismiss the teachers was taken at the last meeting of the Commission before the European elections, as if it had been assumed that we would then hear nothing more about it. The second thing I want to say is that I do not think it acceptable that the Commission, which is, after all, engaged alongside us in the fight for a social Europe, should ditch its social responsibility and its obligations as an employer when it comes to safeguarding its own interests. How else is one to explain the fact, to which reference has already been made in this debate, that the teachers were not informed in advance of their dismissals, not to mention the way in which, for years on end, returns to the Belgian authorities described them only as part-time employees, so that their actual working time could not be taken into account? We are told, thirdly, that teaching is, in future, to be provided only by language schools. The first tenders have already been invited, and it is reported that the first contracts have already been awarded. We can now therefore reckon with the possibility of some of the Commission’s language teaching being provided by the British Council, and, as that body has, as we know, a new head, it is interesting to consider the implications of this. I would ask the Commission to have an independent inquiry into this whole affair, in order, if possible, to conclusively refute the accusations that have been made.

Mr President, occasionally one hears that this Intergovernmental Conference will just be dealing with the technicalities of the Treaty. That is not true! You, President-in-Office, have shown that the political significance of the Intergovernmental Conference is that it will keep to the whole mandate and nothing but the mandate. The political significance lies in the clear determination to conclude the negotiations in October, and in seeking to convince all 27 Member States that this is the right way forward for Europe at this historic moment. I have no doubt that you will succeed, given the clarity of your programme and your firm political will. The chairman of my group has said that you just need to get the ball in the net from the penalty spot. Martin, let us not forget, this is not a penalty shootout, but a penalty awarded mid-game! The game will continue. There is still the whole second half, or the ratification process. Past experience has shown that a few problems may yet emerge. So I feel it would be good, President-in-Office, if you were to seek to convince your colleagues in the Council informally of the need for speedy ratification within the next twelve months. It would be good if the Netherlands and France, who voted 'no', could be the first to ratify. It would also be good, President-in-Office, if you could persuade the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, not to bring up the rear in the ratification process, but rather to lead the way. That would send a clear message to the whole of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having been in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the European Union from the word go, I still support their accession, and will continue to do so. I am delighted at the progress that both countries have made over recent years. Today, however, Parliament is being asked to vote in favour of Accession Treaties when the negotiations on these treaties have not been brought to a proper close. There are key aspects of the Copenhagen criteria that have not been met, and, by threatening to use the safeguard and postponement clauses, the Commission and the Council have revealed the political bankruptcy of the negotiations. To all intents and purposes, we are being asked to agree to an artificially propped-up accession. At the same time, however, the Council is pushing for the treaties to be signed in a hurry, and snubbing Parliament by nullifying its budgetary rights. We should not punish Romania and Bulgaria for this, though, and the exchange of letters between Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and Mr Borrell, the President of Parliament, has at least made it possible for us to cast our votes in favour, even though we are far from happy at having to do so. The President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner should, however, be aware that we are rapidly losing our faith in the willingness and ability of the Council and the Commission to conduct the forthcoming enlargement negotiations in the necessary fashion, or in other words fairly, responsibly and in the interests of everyone. I would advise you not to rely on this House’s constant forbearance and, above all, would ask you to confirm to the House in November, when you submit your report, that the countries are ready to join, rather than presenting yet another interim assessment. This House has always looked favourably upon enlargement in the past, but there is nothing to say that this will not change in the future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on their outstanding report. This Constitution is indeed our baby, and even if it does have a few flaws, there are no ifs or buts in our commitment to it. We want it to grow and flourish. Let me say, secondly, that the greatest challenge for the European Union is not Turkish membership in twenty years’ time, but the ratification of the European Constitution in two. It is by that that history will judge us, and – let me say – not just the politicians, but also the peoples of Europe. I have confidence in the peoples’ intelligence, and in that of their parliaments. In two years’ time, the Constitution will be in place. After all, what will happen if it is not? Those who believe that the status quo under the Treaty of Nice will continue to prevail in Europe are hankering after an illusion. Europe will not shake itself down into a core Europe and a fringe Europe, either; on the contrary, without a European Constitution, the European Union will degenerate into a patchwork Europe, confusing the public at home and destroying Europe’s credibility in the eyes of the world. It would be criss-crossed by the axes and alliances of what would claim to be strategic partnerships. If the Constitution fails, we will revert to a Europe of plots and counter-plots, the old Europe, and it is precisely that that we do not want. The Constitution brings to an end twelve years of intermittent reform, which have taken us from Maastricht to Nice via Amsterdam and from 12 to 15, and then to 25, Member States. Now at last, Europe can again give its full attention to the political challenges of the twenty-first century, which are enormous. We do, though, have a new basis on which to do this. The 25 different peoples, all of whom want to retain their identity – and will do so – who robbed and murdered each other, waged war on each other and laid each other waste for centuries; these 25 peoples are now indissolubly uniting their political destinies. No such thing has been done before in Europe’s history or that of the world. That is what makes our fight for this constitution so worthwhile. Let me say, fourthly, that European unification was, for fifty years, an inward-looking affair, focussing on the accession and integration of new Member States. From now on, it must look outwards. Europe is not a world power, but it does have a world power’s responsibility, and that responsibility we have to be able to live up to. The twenty-first century will present Europeans with immense challenges: globalised business and financial flows, international terrorism, climate change and the disasters associated with it, and the flow of migrants. A new world order is coming into being – not in ten years’ time, but now! Economically speaking, Europe is – still – a global player. Politically speaking, we are in the regional league. If we Europeans do not face up to these challenges now, we will be exiting the stage of world history – politically at first, and then – inevitably – economically. That is not the Europe for us to leave to our children. Europe’s response to globalisation is the unity of its peoples. That is our response to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Let me conclude by saying that the Constitution provides two guiding lights for the European Union’s actions in the future. In the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Constitution affirms that the EU exists not only to guarantee the freedoms of the market, but also so that the citizens may enjoy the freedoms to which they are entitled. Article 3 of the Constitution commits the EU to working towards peace, security and the sustainable development of the earth, thus affirming that the Union bears responsibility for our planet rather than existing for its own sake. Freedom for humanity and responsibility for the world – from these grows the new Europe’s identity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 and 2002 the Heads of State or Government entered into an international commitment to Turkey, which they must honour on 17 December. The negotiations must begin, not only to sustain the reform process in Turkey but also for the sake of the international credibility of the European Union. It will not, however, be a day of great rejoicing. For the first time in the history of the European Union, there is widespread public opposition to the accession of a state. People are not convinced that Turkey can become a truly European country. In the parliamentary debate too, whenever I hear anyone cite one of the benefits of Turkish membership, it is saddled with far more ifs and buts than are normally raised in connection with such a momentous decision. Moreover, no convincing argument has been advanced to demonstrate that Turkey would strengthen rather than weaken the cohesion of Europe. Some see Turkish accession as part of a global strategy to combat terrorism. The intention is to turn the collision of two cultures to advantage, but this bold strategic design underestimates not only Europe’s own powers but those of Turkey too. There is certainly one role that Turkey could never perform as a Member State of the EU: it could never be a bridge to the Middle East. It must be a pillar of the West in the Middle East; as a member of the EU, it would be a party to negotiations, not a mediator. One thing must be quite clear: if Turkish membership were to erode the European Union, that would be too high a price to pay – and not only for the Union, by the way, but for Turkey too. That price must not be paid. On 17 December, the European Council should lay down with unmistakable clarity that the decisive criteria will be not only Turkey’s readiness for membership but also the capacity of the Union to accommodate Turkey and preservation of the momentum of the European integration process.

Mr President, Taoiseach, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish Presidency of the Council was active in many areas, not always to my group’s satisfaction and not always successfully, but it is now my happy task, on behalf of my group, to congratulate you, Taoiseach, Mr President of the Council, on the historic and outstanding role you played as chairman of the Intergovernmental Conference that brought about the European Constitution. It was your astute, persistent and calm negotiation in the last six months that made this Intergovernmental Conference a success. It was a success for you, Taoiseach, and for your team. I also want to express my personal gratitude to you for the way in which you involved Parliament’s two representatives, and its President, in the Intergovernmental Conference’s work. As you know, we had a few difficult stages to get through, but our being able to do so, and do so successfully, is something that we owe not only, but particularly, to you. Indeed, not everything needed for the Constitution has been achieved, and I have to tell the House that not everything that was achieved was 100 per cent right. You know that as well as I do, as well as many others too. We did indeed have to make compromises, and some of them were hard for us, as representatives of the European Parliament, and for the governments of the Member States, to take. I am sure that you too, as head of the Irish Government, found some of the compromises difficult. It is also the case that some simple solutions that we arrived at in the Convention were made more complicated – there is a large number of supplementary protocols and declarations, restrictions on the one hand and exceptions on the other. That must not be allowed to obscure the big picture, the great achievement of the Intergovernmental Conference. Although public attention has, over the past months, been focussed on a few contentious points, the Intergovernmental Conference adopted over 90% of the Convention draft, virtually without any debate. In saying this, I am not doing as the former President of the Convention did and counting words; that is nonsense, or, to be less blunt about it, rather childish. Rather, I can see that the structure, coherence and substance of the draft Constitution produced by the Convention have not been touched. That is the first great success, which also confirms the methodology that the Convention adopted. The second is democracy; although there are some deficiencies in that area, the European Parliament’s new status as a legislator with full and equal rights, the fact that the election of the President of the Commission is to be proceeded with in future not only in the light of the European elections, but also following a consultation procedure before the candidates are nominated – that, too, I regard as a success. You yourself know, Taoiseach, that we, as representatives of the European Parliament, had to draw a red line when it came to the Budget procedure of the future. On a personal level, I am grateful to you for ensuring that we did not reach that red line, but instead were able to come up with a good, workable compromise in the teeth of all those finance ministers who, of all things, wanted to make changes to Parliament’s budgetary rights, and to change them for the worse. (Applause)
 The European Union has greater capacity to act and more transparency. Let me just say two things in general terms. We know that this is not the constitution of a European federal state; it is the constitution of a union of citizens and states, which will always be more than just provinces of a Federal Republic of Europe. The EU is not a copy, at European level, of the European nation-state of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is something sui generis
, and so we turn a deaf ear to the critics who keep on drawing comparisons between us and the American Constitution, saying that this draft Constitution is far too complicated, too long, and so on. None of that is fair. We must judge the Constitution in terms of what Europe needs. The Constitution must be judged by whether or not it manages to establish on a common basis the joining together of twenty-five different peoples and states that have plundered, murdered, waged warfare on and devastated one another for centuries. The Constitution must be judged by whether or not it can bring together on the basis of a shared constitution, twenty-five and more European states and peoples, all of which, while being bound together by their political destiny, want to retain their own identity, language, culture, and historical memories. Our having achieved this is a great and historic triumph in the annals of the European Union, one in which the Irish Presidency of the Council has played an outstanding part. What matters now is that the peoples of Europe, through their parliaments and through referendums, should make the Constitution a political reality. My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will play its part in this, and we will make sure that Europe gets a Constitution that will take it into the new century. (Applause)

 Mr President, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has provided a good contribution here towards ensuring a social Europe, and I would like to sincerely thank both of the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela and Mrs Lulling. For us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, two aspects of this matter are very important, as I would like to briefly point out. On the one hand, it is necessary to include fathers in the framework strategy to improve the balance between professional and family life. We do not, as the Commission states, want eighteen weeks of maternity leave, as this is already in place in almost all European countries, with the exception of Germany and Malta. We want to go one step further, namely to introduce two weeks of paternity leave. For us, it is also important for both directives to offer the same rights for same sex couples. This is important in the case of the directive on assisting spouses and the assisting member of unmarried couples. I would also like to point out that these protection systems must be obligatory, otherwise they become arbitrary. I would, once again, like to return to the argument put forward by the employers, namely that this directive on extended maternity leave would be too much for companies to cope with in a time of crisis. That simply cannot be the case. In Germany, we have a system where, in the case of a pay-as-you-go scheme, the costs are refunded - even up to a hundred percent! That is why I am also asking the Conservative group to show understanding and to follow us in improving legal protection for working mothers. Before the European elections, we want to send people, especially fathers and mothers, a clear and definite signal that, in times of crisis, the concept of a social Europe will not be abandoned, and clearly state that we aim to invest in people, in future generations and in demographic change. I would also like to ask Commissioner Špidla, in connection with the inclusion of fathers in the legislation, to think again and, together with us, to fight in the Council for progress with regard to maternity leave and ensuring a better balance between work and family life.

 Mr President, in light of the signing of the Shia family law, which shows contempt for women, in Afghanistan, I urge the Commission to make the rights of women a central part of its Afghanistan strategy once again. In November 2002, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sent a delegation under my leadership to Afghanistan in order to make sure that women were not being excluded in the reconstruction of the country. We held talks with President Karzai, numerous government representatives, women’s and human rights organisations, and we were very encouraged. An awakening to more in the way of safety, stability and prosperity for women, including without the burka, seemed to be within reach. The health system, education, training and the chance to earn a living were opened up to women after the Taliban rule. The highest child mortality rate in the world seemed to be improving. Through our intervention, a 25% quota for women was included in the new constitution for the first parliament that was to be elected and around four million refugees returned to their war-ravaged country. Unfortunately, however, very little has happened in the last five years. Warnings from women’s rights organisations, such as medica mondiale
, that violence must be stopped seemed to go totally unheeded, and at the beginning of April the radical Islamic Taliban in Kandahar murdered the German-Afghan women’s rights campaigner Sitara Achikzai. We were forced to discover that other women had been shot, such as the highest-ranking police officer. We must not sit back and watch this happen and do nothing about it. The civilian awakening is at serious risk. We must put a stop to this new Shia family law. The European Parliament resolution must state loud and clear that the law must be thrown out. If that does not succeed, international support for Afghanistan is also at risk if women’s rights are not respected. Either an awakening into the international community, which respects human rights, or regression into oppression by the Taliban is what is on the cards. This must be said loud and clear to Mr Karzai!

 Mr President, as the Committee on Culture and Education’s rapporteur for the new anti-discrimination directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, I warmly welcome the Commission’s proposal and would specifically like to thank Mr Špidla. Eurobarometer polls show that approximately three quarters of the population of the EU think that action needs to be taken in this field. The Committee on Culture and Education called for amendments and additions in three areas. Firstly, the inclusion of gender. We agree with the compromises achieved. We wish to guarantee access to media and education, and regulate against multiple discrimination; some good compromises have been achieved here. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported this comprehensive horizontal directive. If German conservatives and liberals now reject the directive in its entirety, they will be revealing their true colours: they want to continue to discriminate against gay people, and to broadcast propaganda. There is no need to fear extremists such as Scientologists under the new directive: it will still be possible to reject advertisements or refuse to book assembly rooms. The Committee on Culture and Education votes unanimously in favour of the horizontal framework directive.

 Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to vote in favour of this alternative resolution. However, we would like to state that in recital G ‘sexual and reproductive health’ should not be seen as a step backwards in relation to decisions that have already been made. It is important to us that the sexual and reproductive rights of women are recognised.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new proposal submitted by the Commission is urgently needed. The members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating to the proposal. It is essential that we go beyond the confines of the Daphne Programme and introduce legislative initiatives in the area of child pornography. Of course, this is also the responsibility of the users, but the states must take action. For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution. We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint European approach. We need more background information in the form of concrete studies on the social situation of the victims, because family members themselves are often responsible for abusing children and putting them on the net. It is important for us to make definite progress in this area. I hope that the Commission is prepared to work closely with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality so that we can resolve these questions together.

 Mr President, I am amazed that women are still so patient with us. We have been talking about pay inequality for 50 years, and nothing significant has changed. The numbers speak for themselves: 15% less for the same work. This deprives women of a fair wage, because, looked at the other way round, it means that women have to work one and a quarter times as long to earn the same money. Where do we stand in the European Union? The Member States need to do more in this respect, and I am grateful to Mr Špidla for taking on board our proposals here in Parliament and for showing the will to take legislative action. Evidently there is no other option. In Germany, one of the largest Member States of the European Union, the pay differential in the private sector is 23%. That is unacceptable, and means that we are bringing up the rear of the EU. We know full well that France and Scandinavia have taken positive measures. That is what it is about. We call on the social partners to take action, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament calls for transparency in businesses, so that bonuses can be seen clearly and be included in the official assessment, so that we can get a grip on it. Regular wage audits may reveal successes or failures in combating wage discrimination. In my view, a law for the private sector will be unavoidable in Germany. We must put more pressure on the Member States to introduce a statutory minimum wage, so that it can be taken for granted that women can earn a living wage, because that is the best safeguard against poverty in old age. I would, in any case, call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in order to retain this clarity in Mrs Bauer’s report, to withdraw its deleting amendments, which would further water down the report. Let us stick with the clear language it has at the moment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by supporting the Erasmus Mundus programme, the European Parliament is sending the right signal in times of crisis. Moving closer together through education and developing the EU as a centre of excellence in learning around the world are among the traditional demands of social democracy. However, the budget of EUR 950 million for this period seems modest, especially in comparison with the hundreds of billions now being spent as a result of the failures of bank managers. The objective of excellence that lay behind the first stage of the programme should be pursued further. The new programme also seeks to promote intercultural understanding and cooperation with third countries and boost their development in the field of higher education. The most important new points in comparison with the first initiative are the inclusion of joint doctoral programmes, increased grants and more intensive structural cooperation with universities in third countries. There has been progress in all three areas. Masters and doctoral programmes aim to promote the excellence of European higher education in the world. There has been progress on this, too. The increased expenditure on students from third countries has been taken into account and, thanks to our rapporteur’s negotiating skills, key criteria that Parliament wanted introduced into Erasmus Mundus III have been improved. Our aims – geographical balance, gender balance, removal of visa barriers – have won the support of the Council. We succeeded in this with the ‘Youth’ programme, and we must also do so here with Erasmus.

 Madam President, a few days before the European Football Championship gets under way, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – and I hope the entire European Parliament – is showing forced prostitution the red card once again. Up to 800 000 women throughout the world become victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation every year. This is one of the worst human rights violations today and even at major sporting events, quick sex around the venues of football matches is also linked to this modern-day slavery. Two years ago at the football World Cup in Germany, we initiated a wide-ranging debate here in Parliament and launched a campaign to ensure that the huge wave of forced prostitution the experts initially feared and the corresponding negative spin-offs were able to be prevented thanks to the support of the fans through the opinioned public. However, the subject then disappeared from sight again. We have introduced legal initiatives and, with the experience we have gained from the German campaign, supported very extensively by the women’s organisations, have managed to set up victim protection measures and demonstrate the plight of the women who usually come from Central and Eastern Europe. They are in dire straits as criminals on the one hand, since they do not have any residence permits, but as victims, on the other hand, because they are mercilessly exploited by the human traffickers. We have moved on a step further with the victim protection measures, cross-border cooperation and the legitimate issuing of residence permits. We now want to use the public at matches in Austria and Switzerland to highlight the subject again. In Germany the Socialist Minister of Justice has announced draconian penalties for punters of forced prostitution. There are still, however, many loopholes, and Parliament has to ensure that these loopholes are closed. I would ask the Commission to support us in this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Lynne for her report; it comes just at the right time. A word to all Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: wage discrimination against women has been included in the Treaty for the last 40 years, yet, nothing has essentially changed. If you in the PPE-DE Group wish to abide by your rejection of a horizontal directive, it is very clear to me that your values and principles relate to fine words and celebrations in the European Union. You do not want equal treatment at all! You accept discrimination against gays and lesbians, for example. You want this to be a political culture. No, that will not do for me! Equal opportunities encompass all the criteria of Article 13, and multiple discrimination ultimately has to be included, too. Anti-discrimination policy can only be credible if it itself does not discriminate further. There has been a flood of proceedings and actions in the European Union. This was all propaganda aimed at avoiding certain minimum standards. The Member States that have stopped short of this just have to make haste. Infringement procedures have been initiated, even against my own country, Germany. I now appeal to the Commission, to each individual Commissioner, to state clearly that they are in favour of a clear horizontal directive and putting paid to a hierarchic arrangement of human rights in the European Union. We have to implement our EU policy in accordance with the Treaty. Article 13 is part of the Treaty and must therefore encompass all this, as stated in the Lynne report.
 Lissy Gröner  (PSE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure Mrs Kauppi of the full support of our Socialist Group on all the points she addressed in her report. The equality report is appearing during the year of equal opportunities for all, and we can also mark 50 years of equality policy in the European Union. Unless pressure is exerted and things change, women will no longer trust the European Union. It was also announced that the year 2007 would see the setting up of the European Institute for Gender Equality. What is the situation as regards appointments to the Board? Here our Parliament has a right of say. Where are preparations actually under way to ensure that the Vilnius institute can become operational before the year is out? The EU has not made use of its key competences in the field of equal pay – a major area, which has been addressed by many female colleagues. I find it scandalous that 15% of women are still paid less for their work than men. Sweden is the only country where things look better, with a figure of just 10%. In my country, Germany, the figure is 26%, and I am no longer prepared to tolerate that. This is a case where the Commission has to muster up the courage to exert pressure on the Member States. Reconciling professional and family life: Mr Špidla has taken measures in that area. I am glad. We support the fact that fathers are also having to do their share. Undertakings also bear great responsibility here. That is why our Group has launched a Europe-wide campaign of support. We want a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of measures we take under, for instance, the Structural Funds. A recent hearing in the Committee on Regional Development showed that hardly any account has been taken to date of the fact that women benefit far less from the EU budget than men. Gender budgeting is, therefore, another key demand of ours. The Commission has announced measures in two areas: the implementation of legislative measures to combat multiple discrimination and to combat violence against women. We have scarcely touched on that today, but it is a burning issue that needs to be resolved.

 Mr President, Commissioner, may I express my particular thanks to Mrs Batzeli for this report, which was drafted on the initiative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. The group was delighted to receive this motley and very comprehensive catalogue of proposed measures to deal with juvenile delinquency today. Implementation, of course, is primarily a matter for the Member States, but we in the European Union also bear responsibility for tackling this growing phenomenon. The Commissioner, as you know, presented a strategy for the rights of children. That is undoubtedly another contribution to the effort to develop something together. We must not wait until city suburbs are ablaze again before we do anything. Above all, we must have an integrated approach to the solution of social problems. We must ensure that youth unemployment is reduced, that poverty among young people is alleviated and that social imbalances are redressed. We also have the structural funds, of course, which we can continue to use; in this respect the Member States have numerous options. As you made very clear, Commissioner, the Daphne programme offers a wealth of really good ways in which we could tackle the phenomenon of violence on a cross-border basis, and the Youth in Action programme also offers useful measures to that end. I believe, however, that the Member States should offer far more in the way of efficient psychosocial care for problem families. We must strengthen the role of schools in the fight against violence and juvenile crime. It is our responsibility to provide assistance through our Lifelong Learning programme. I believe the responsibility of the media must be more strongly emphasised. This includes a responsibility to cut down on scenes of violence. I believe it is imperative that there should be a ban on violent videos and violent games for young people. Let me close by thanking the Commissioner. The telephone hotline for children and young people is an important contribution that provides assistance and allows young people to be heard more clearly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report marks a further milestone in the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. We see from the Green Paper on Demography that the life stages of young people – of students of both genders, that is – are being completed later when it comes to work and family, and women have seen in this process the opportunity to have, by means of ‘second chance’ education, a better life, a life of their own choosing, and they have seized that opportunity. Women, accounting for 59% of those who complete higher education, have in that respect overtaken men, but the position is nowhere near as favourable when it comes to decisions taken later on, where the glass ceiling again comes into play, and only 43% of doctoral candidates are women, with the figure falling to a mere 15% for professorships, and lower than that – to 8% – in Germany. Is anyone surprised, then, that women, particularly academics, are more and more likely to decide against having children? We need to work towards overcoming gender stereotypes and the social divisions between the worlds of women and men, and must adopt measures to improve compatibility between family and working life, for example by means of affordable facilities. That point has been made, and I am glad that the Commissioner has expressed the intention of doing something about this, but, with the best will in the world, that is not on. What is needed is for pressure to be brought to bear. People will decide for themselves how many children they want, or, indeed, whether they want to have any at all. I do not know whether young academics will be aware of our debate here today, but we have to respect their right to come to their own decisions, and make the choice easier for them. We also have to respect the desire of more and more people today to live alternative lifestyles and their abandonment of the traditional family model; I might add that that most needs to be taken into account by our governments, not least the government in Poland, and it makes me positively furious that the Poles are yet again standing aloof from this. Many friends of mine in Poland have asked me to make this point today, and I stand here to speak out for the people in Poland who have the same right to free personal choice as anyone else.

 Madam President, standing as I do, not in a full Chamber, but in more of a family atmosphere, I rejoice that this is a good day for the millions of women, children and young people who are on the receiving end of violence, for we have adopted, in an accelerated procedure, the Daphne programme for the prevention and combating of violence and for the protection of its victims, for the 2007-2013 period as a part in its own right of the framework programme for fundamental rights and justice. At the very outset, it did not look as if we would manage it, and I want to thank Commissioner Frattini for having taken on board this House’s arguments and rejecting the original plan, according to which Daphne would be run in tandem with the anti-drugs programme. By means of intensive negotiations with, among others, the Council and the Commission, we have succeeded in putting together a clearly-defined programme, Daphne III, as an important element in managing the rising tide of violence in an enlarged European Union. Parliament having achieved a policy agreement with the Finnish Presidency of the Council as long ago as November 2006, the Council then, in its Common Position of March 2007, adopted most of the amendments from first reading – not, admittedly, word for word, but the principles contained in them. I would remind the House that, for many women, their own homes are the most dangerous of places; for many of them, from every Member State, abuse meted out to them by husband, partner, father or brother is a fact of daily life. One out of every three to four women has already experienced some sort of physical or sexual abuse; what they have gone through in their minds cannot be measured in figures. The things we are talking about here know no borders: trafficking in women, with the women getting younger and younger; genital mutilation among immigrant communities; violent crimes committed for the sake of honour; the online trade in child pornography; homophobic violence – the list of areas in which action under the new Daphne III programme is needed is long, and the one I have given is far from complete. Having, as rapporteur, fought for Daphne for years on end, I rejoice that the increased budget of EUR 116 million makes it possible for us to reach far more NGOs; the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality insisted on more transparency, on the removal of bureaucratic obstacles and on easier access with the smaller organisations in mind. We have also managed to retain the helpdesk service and to bring together the expertise available in all the Member States and among our partners outside the EU, drawing on it in a multidisciplinary think-tank with the aim of keeping it better in step with our political efforts. My expectation is that the Gender Institute, which is soon to be established, will continue to devote itself to this priority of combating violence. It has to be said, though, Commissioner, that there are two other aspects that have to be addressed without delay, for you promised us, in the debate on the Daphne programme’s first reading, that you would endeavour to establish a legal basis for the campaign against violence, yet, now, in 2007, we find ourselves in the position – which I, for one, find intolerable – that Daphne III has to be founded on Article 152, which has to do with health. This is where it would be appropriate to take another step forward. Secondly, it was planned – as recorded in the Council’s additional statement on the Daphne programme, and as promised by Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, on 8 March – that an initiative would be set in motion for a European Year against the violence suffered by children, young people and women, which occurs in very many different ways. Having gained experience from getting Daphne I and II really up and running in every Member State, many of which have benefited by having adopted for themselves the Austrian exclusion law, we will continue to fight for the benefits of shared experience at European level, and for the introduction of national plans of action and legislation in areas that were formerly taboo, by which I mean the private battlefields onto which we hope to shed some light where that was formerly unthinkable. I therefore recommend that this honourable House extend Daphne III without further amendment, thus enabling us to proceed speedily with its implementation and bring private terror to an end.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as far as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is concerned, this report, which puts women who have to live with disabilities at the heart of our work, is extremely important. There are a range of legal instruments, such as the UN Convention, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 13 [of the Treaty on European Union] and the Manifesto of Disabled Women which we should observe very closely. At all levels, it is clear that women are not victims; rather, they are repeatedly disadvantaged. This multiple discrimination must also be reflected in measures adopted by the European Union. We have designated 2007 as the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities for All’. Here too, however, women, especially women with disabilities, constitute a marginal group. As has been stressed so unequivocally by Commissioner Almunia, 80% of women with disabilities are also victims of violence, everyday violence. They repeatedly experience violence and, above all, sexual violence on a very much more frequent basis. The DAPHNE programme must therefore put a stronger emphasis on combating this violence and we must also strengthen the networks of women with disabilities. In their working lives, women have it doubly difficult if they suffer from a disability. They already suffer in any case. Unemployment levels among women are above average and the social exclusion of disabled people is increasing at a rate which is no longer acceptable. We must therefore use the best model from all European countries as an example and make much better use of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund for promoting model projects and remind Member States of their duties. We have written gender mainstreaming into the structural regulations but do not have the funds available to proceed with sanctions against the Member States which do not abide by it. This is a fairly central requirement. It is clear that greater pressure must be applied here. We require integrated education. This is necessary for both sexes. It is a very important learning curve for people both with and without disabilities to be prepared as early as Kindergarten to live an independent life. To this end, we must not let charity prevail and we must quite definitely help men and women obtain their rights as well as establish barrier-free access for them, and not just to buildings and public local transport, but to new media as well. I also hope that the Gender Institute can help bring the organisations and best practices together. Every one of us may wake up tomorrow suffering from a disability. What matters is strengthening each person’s individuality and valuing his or her uniqueness. Then we really will be in agreement on many issues.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, this evaluation is not a simple matter, for we have already, and repeatedly, urged that gender-specific data are needed if the expenditure is to be assessed, and, to our regret, such data is still not available, and so there are still limits on the amount of gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming that it is possible to include in the assessment. We ask that these data be submitted in the next Budget discharge reports. It is particularly in Structural Funds programmes and the like that precise data is vital if we are to see how much, in the final analysis, is allocated to the equal support of women. It has turned out that the flow of funds in the Daphne programme has been blocked, and that is a major problem, for we know that violence is going on against women, children and young people on an enormous scale. We know that the projects proposed were very good ones, yet even so the money has not been flowing, and that means that help is needed here. In the actual case I am thinking of, a range of trans-European projects was rejected. We are in the course of preparing a European Year against Violence, and the Council of Europe has started up a campaign. There is massive need in this area, and the Commission must get a move on.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say ‘thank you’ to Mrs Bozkurt for having now presented the second report on behalf of the women’s committee and for her very judicious and expert approach to the subject. The possibility of Turkey joining the European Union means that we in this House must give pride of place to respect for human rights – and in this specific instance women’s rights as an integral element in them – as an indispensable precondition for its accession. Speaking as a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I see three great blocks on which work is urgently needed. The first is education and the world of work; the unfortunate fact is that the presence of women on the labour market has decreased from 35% in 1998 to 25% today, even though there are hopeful signs in some areas – in the number of women practising as lawyers and physicians, for instance – but, if the Lisbon Strategy’s targets, which include 60% participation of women in the labour market, are to be met, none of this fits together, and, if Turkey wants to be a candidate, it has to be well aware of that. Education is a key to bringing about development and change; unfortunately, particularly in eastern Turkey, a very large number of women are still excluded from it, and 25% of them are still illiterate. More also needs to be done – and as a matter of urgency – where the combating of violence is concerned. Mr Erdoğan has committed himself to more being done on this front, but that is far from enough; the establishment of women’s refuges would be another step in the right direction, and the public debate on violence against women and ‘honour crimes’ must go on. Finally, I have an appeal to make in relation to the Turkish elections; it is that there has to be discussion of quotas if Turkey is to continue to make progress. The existing level of women’s participation in parliamentary life – 4% at the national level and 1% in the municipalities – is unsustainable, so urgent action, including such things as a quota system, needs to be taken to deal with this, and that will do a great service not only to women but also to cooperation between Europe and Turkey.

 Madam President, I, too, am glad to see you in the Chair today, and warmly congratulate you on your election. So far, this debate has been conducted in the absence of the Commission and the Council, and that was only right and proper. Its subject is the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the committees, and, more specifically, the first interim report following on from the report I produced and which was adopted in 2003. This report highlights very well how we should implement gender mainstreaming in this House, and, while it was right that we should concern ourselves with this, I do now rather fear that we have missed an opportunity, since we are all talking about everything under the sun except what we can do in this Parliament of ours. What has become of its Paragraph 1, with its action plan for a policy of gender mainstreaming, that is to say, equality in every evaluation and analysis and the new development of concepts for the equality of women and men in Parliament? There is still a very great deal left to be done, and no actual plan of action. And what of the second, with its priorities for equality issues and a high-level working party? This working party has done its job very well, and the right procedure was followed, in that reports were produced by all the committees. As we have heard from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, some of the Vice-Chairmen of committees have done very good work, but what they did was sometimes exposed to ridicule. What has become of our demand for women in decision-making positions within Parliament? No definite action has been taken to make that happen. The groups and the national delegations treated this demand with varying degrees of seriousness, but no proper strategy has been forthcoming. What, then, of the analysis of the Budget procedure? Here, too, no definite action has been taken, although the policy of gender budgeting was meant to have been given tangible form. What progress has been made towards achieving an effective press and information strategy – something else that we called for in 2003 – which is another area where there are still considerable deficits? Now that we are to conduct a proper analysis and evaluation, I very much hope that we will be helped, in the analysis of the committees, by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which we have recently voted to set up. It is to be regretted, though, that the report has far from enough to say about the state of affairs in the groups, the delegations and the substance of policies, and so I should like to see us taking a more ambitious approach and managing, by 2009 – when elections are due – to achieve real agreements that make gender mainstreaming possible and put women in positions of leadership. Grateful though I am for the work that has been done, we must still make very considerable effort to get anywhere near achieving the goal that we set ourselves in the 2003 report.

 This report is an evaluation of gender mainstreaming policy in the European Parliament, further to my report on that subject (A5-0060/2003
). The present report on ‘gender mainstreaming in the work of the committees’ takes up issues raised in the 2003 report, evaluates the efforts made to date, and seeks to highlight the future prospects for the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted in such a way as to cause the deletion of essential passages from a report that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality had adopted unanimously, such as, for example, those highlighting the roles of the high-level working party, gender budgeting and personnel policy. Being persuaded that the Záborská report, in significant respects, does not go as far as the Resolution of 2003, I have voted against it.

 Madam President, the Committee on Women’s Rights, too, is grateful for the good cooperation and willingness of the Commission's rapporteur. We do of course seek to maintain European quality television, which means securing the diversity and independence of the media. The revision of the directive must not, however, be allowed to open up new grey areas, which is what we fear where product placement – formerly scorned as advertising by stealth – is concerned. Product placement will now, in principle, be banned, yet numerous derogations make it possible for the Member States to blur the clear dividing line that separates editorial independence from the influences exerted by commercial advertising. We, in the Women’s Committee, have firmly repudiated product placement, and also want better protection for the young, with pornography, gratuitous violence and images derogatory to human dignity banned from audiovisual programming. We also want to see restrictions on advertising. Advertising must not be free to do as it likes. We must ensure that advertising periods are not extended. I am in favour of retaining the 45-minute rule, and also of alcohol not appearing in programmes broadcast during the day, in the interests of better protection for children and young people.

 Mr President, I start with many thanks to my co-rapporteur and to the Commission. We have worked together very well in attempting to get the Institute up and running as soon as possible, and we have been very successful in this. I would, however, ask, Mr President, that all services be again reminded to check that versions of the report in all languages use gender-sensitive language, which is not universally guaranteed in my own language – German – despite repeated calls for this. For as long as the European Parliament has been in existence, we have presented ourselves as an engine of equality. For ten years now, we have been discussing how best to facilitate the establishment of an institution that would pursue gender mainstreaming and draw on the best outcomes from all countries in performing its horizontal task. Following a feasibility study, demands were made for the Gender Institute, to which the Council acceded nearly two years ago now, when it resolved that the Institute would be set up, and on a budget-neutral basis. What does that mean? In practice, it means that the Gender Institute will be funded from what was the gender equality programme. The Budget was halved, and what was left of the programme then became part of the social action programme ‘Progress’. Such is the price that women have had to pay. If certain parties are going to claim that the Institute costs too much, the response will have to be that, on the contrary, women have paid a lot for it. Here in this House, though, with a great deal of support from women’s groups, we have managed to advance the Institute’s cause. We want it to work independently in facilitating the centralisation of information on tried and tested model procedures for the best possible equalisation of opportunities. We would like to see these examples collected from all countries and the abolition of the gulf between the legal position with regard to equality of opportunity – as found, for example, in the European treaties, as Article 3 once more confirms – and the discrimination that actually goes on from day to day. We want women no longer to earn something like 30% less than their male counterparts. In the case of those who preside over this House, that may well not be so, and may even be cause for amusement, but when a woman working on a production line earns 30% less than her male colleagues, it is not funny any more. We want all the Member States to have access to information on how to successfully combat violence, forced prostitution and sexual exploitation, along with a Europe-wide exchange of information on how discrimination based on gender may be brought to an end in the twenty-first century. I have already stressed that the agreement we reached in committee came about rapidly. The Commission was highly supportive in accepting at once 35 of the 50 amendments that we adopted at first reading, although there were others for which we had to fight. We had to fight hard to get a hearing for the head of the Institute – and I want to emphasise that I am not gender-neutral about this, in that I expect the Director appointed to be a woman – but we did manage to get it, together with a smaller Management Board. It is far from clear why each and every Member State should be represented on the Management Board, for the end result of that would be that only 13 people would be doing the work, with 33 monitoring them, and that makes sense to nobody. We want the European Gender Equality Institute to do groundwork of the European institutions, and the assistance of experts to enable us to do our work in this House more efficiently. How, though, can it be – and this I see as the big drawback – that the Council should decide, as it did last week, that the Institute should end up in Vilnius? That is a long way away from the places where decisions are taken. A working institute such as the Gender Equality Institute does not have any representative function and should not go where it can boost a country's image, but should, on the contrary, be close to our spheres of government; the effect of this is to weaken it. We wanted to see the institutions supported in their work and that work being efficient and helping to make equality a political reality. That is why I think the proposal we produced is a good one, and am asking this House to agree to the compromise we have worked out with the Council, and for broad-based support for the European Institute for Gender Equality. We have opened up the way to an early agreement, and I again thank all those who had a hand in this, particularly the Commission, which made repeated attempts to bridge the gulf that divided Parliament and the Council on this. I reiterate my thanks to all those who worked with us, in particular the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups. One can expect the Gender Institute to achieve lift off some time soon, and that will represent the passing of a milestone, but there will still be much work to be completed if the great tasks are to get done. Grateful though I am for the willingness to work together with us on this front, I do want to ask who would actually be able to head up this Institute; it would have to be someone capable of offering not only expertise, but also the necessary insider knowledge of the European institutions, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality will take great care to ensure that the Institute does not end up with someone from the Council or the Commission who is incapable of performing this function. If we manage to get to grips with the maintenance of a large-scale network of women’s organisations – which is what we envisage doing – that will make the establishment of this Institute an enormous leap ahead for the women’s movement in Europe.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today we have been hearing the overwhelming figures that bear witness to the effect that breast cancer has on the lives of both men and women. It is a matter of pure chance whether treatment is started quickly and efficiently and therefore how high the woman's chances of survival are. As the coordinator of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I have been working on this topic for many years, and we have gained a great deal of experience. We cannot leave it at that, though. We have had the EU guidelines for quality mammography for over ten years now. In Belgium, where I have my second home, I am invited for routine screening, while in my homeland of Germany nothing is happening. The lives of mothers, daughters and wives could be saved, and the trauma reduced. However, we are still only progressing at a snail's pace. The Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality presented an excellent report in 2003, but very little has happened since. I think there is a lack of political will in this matter: I can tell that the will is there at European level, but in the Member States much still remains to be done. The Seventh Research Framework Programme now once again gives us the opportunity to exert pressure so that more money goes into research. In the case of other women's diseases, such as migraines, too, there has been little political pressure applied to move forward and take interdisciplinary action. As over 20 years of experience in the United States have shown, interdisciplinary breast centres can provide very efficient assistance. We now also have such centres in Europe, but here, too, I do not see any sign of the political will to really implement that. Let us therefore work together, here in the European Parliament, to fight against the trauma of breast cancer, and do so for everyone, not just those who can afford it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of Members present in this plenary is certainly no indication of the importance of this issue, and the ‘Youth in Action’ programme for the period from 2007 to 2013 is certainly a milestone for our young European fellow-citizens. I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their very constructive cooperation. At first reading stage, we worked through 58 amendments, most of which found their way into the draft, and it is through this result of informal negotiations that we now arrive at the Common Position, which we are able to accept and on which we are able to agree at second reading. Working both with and for young people aged between 15 and 18, the perhaps some 170 million citizens who are the European Union’s primary concern, all three institutions have endeavoured to find a solution that makes Europe real for them, that helps to make the programme less bureaucratic and makes access to it easier for disadvantaged young people. We have, with this programme, had a number of general objectives in mind. First among them is the fostering of citizenship. We want to make it easier for young people to work together as members of society while also offering them the opportunity to cooperate at European level, thereby, among other things, overcoming voter apathy and awakening in them an interest in politics. Secondly, we want to promote solidarity and tolerance among young people, particularly as a means towards greater social cohesion in the EU. In this way, it will be possible for young people, together, to develop new lifestyles and models of coexistence. We want to promote mutual understanding between young people and the multicultural diversity that we in Europe treasure. We also want to promote systems for supporting youth organisations and young people’s civil society organisations and cohesion among young people even beyond Europe’s borders. It is with those purposes in mind that we have negotiated a budget of EUR 885 million. In my capacity as rapporteur, I have proposed the submission of minimum budgets for the following five headings. Of the funding available, 30% is to go to the traditional youth exchange ‘Youth for Europe’. The object of ‘European Voluntary Service’ is involvement, for a period of between two and twelve months, in non-profit-making activity for the common good in a country other than one’s own, and this project is to receive 23% of the funds. ‘Youth for the World’ is a new project intended to awaken understanding of other peoples in a spirit of openness, which is very important at various levels, and to which 6% of overall resources are to be allocated. The ‘support systems for youth’ are to receive at least 15%; by this is meant the European Youth Forum and the network of youth organisations and persons active in this field whom it supports. It is intended that 4% of the funds should go to support European cooperation among young people, which would amount to the dividing up of 76% of the sectors, and that would offer the Commission sufficient flexibility to become more actively involved where necessary. Facing up to challenges is the right approach. We have the funds to support the special project ‘European Youth Week’, and we want the Pact for European Youth, concluded by the Council in 2005, to come alive. It cannot be acceptable that we should look on and do nothing while disorder breaks out among young people and while young people in the European Union lack jobs and prospects. We must ensure that young people have something to look forward to, and we want the Member States to give these projects their wholehearted support, for we cannot deal with the problem on our own. I am therefore appealing to the Member States to get stuck in. I recommend that this House agree to the compromise we have arrived at and adopt the Common Position unamended.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Trüpel for the outstanding cooperation, which smoothed the path towards agreement at first reading. Globalisation presents us with huge challenges; ordinary people are obliged to adapt themselves with ever-greater speed and flexibility to new conditions, and in this, education – in both the social and economic sense – acquires strategic significance. If you want equality of opportunity in Europe, you must ensure that education is made accessible to all and that disadvantages – whether resulting from personal, social, cultural or economic circumstances – are minimised, and this is particularly relevant in view of the forthcoming ‘Year of Equal Opportunities for All’. In view of the Lisbon Strategy’s ambitious goal of making Europe the world’s most dynamic knowledge-based economic area, making outsiders of wide swathes of the population is something we cannot afford, and so we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, welcome the reference framework that Mrs Trüpel has outlined, which includes the eight key competences. It is particularly such disadvantaged groups as those whose parental homes or lack of primary education denied them the opportunity of secure and sound vocational training who must not be excluded. People with learning disabilities, those who dropped out of school, the long-term unemployed and those returning to work after having a family – which means primarily women – not to mention older people, migrants and the disabled, must be supported in their endeavours by targeted policies and programmes, such as those for lifelong learning, although we are well aware that the regulation of education systems is largely a matter for the Member States and is also highly diverse. It is only recently that educational matters in Germany have, by means of the reform of federalism, been transferred from the national level and handed over to the regions, and so I urge that agreement be speedily reached on a European frame of reference. To take a narrowly and pettily national view of education and of lifelong learning would be to capitulate in the face of the challenges of today’s world, our response to which will, at the end of the day, determine whether the European economic and social model proves to be a success or a failure.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission’s original proposal was that Daphne should be a joint programme for combating violence and both educating people about drugs and preventing the abuse of them. Getting it to withdraw this proposal took a determined campaign, with joint statements by the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality and women’s organisations, and I really am relieved that they have avoided the issues of drugs and violence being confused and enabled us to press on with what is one of the EU’s most successful programmes. To date, however, it has been possible to use Daphne I and II to fund only some 17% of the good proposals that have been submitted, which is a demonstration of how enormous demand is, and it is for that reason that the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality is calling for additional resources. Today sees us sending out two very clear messages. The first is that Europe will attach greater weight to the campaign against violence and refrain from conflating it with other aspects. The second is that we acknowledge and support the valuable work done on the ground by organisations such as women’s organisations, numerous self-help and human rights organisations, youth associations and their networks. Violence is on the increase in daily life, particularly those aspects of it that cross borders, and it is this that the Daphne programme addresses first, having come into being in response to it. The women’s movement made a priority of such matters as domestic violence, child abuse, and the trafficking of women for their sexual exploitation, and we have been able to develop many good projects to deal with these things, while also raising public awareness of them – and not just since the World Cup. Daphne I and Daphne II have yielded valuable knowledge, one result of which has been that all the projects have been summarised in a user-friendly ‘tool kit’, which it has now been possible to pass on to the various professional organisations; studies have also been made available to a wide professional public, along with contacts far beyond Europe’s borders. Now, though, we have new tasks to which to address ourselves. Daphne III makes cross-border ‘networking’ much more important. New things are happening in the migration field, and there is much important work to be done on the people-trafficking front. We have proposed financial support for a network of ombudspersons for children, and a single number for children's emergency telephones throughout Europe. We also want to reinforce the networks of organisations dealing with violence on the Internet. The various activities make up a long list, and so it is not unreasonable to do as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has done and demand EUR 120 or 125 million for them, and I hope that this House will help to meet the need that this demand reflects. This House, during the last stage of Daphne, managed to secure the establishment of a helpdesk, and we have had a very positive experience of this. It has helped organisations to establish contact with one another across borders and to find the right people to talk to. When considering the establishment of a ‘think tank’, we should also have recourse to the immense reserve of knowledge to be found in the organisations, drawing on this knowledge and deepening it. I do not, however, wish too great a burden to be placed on Daphne, and so I would ask you to be careful with Amendment 56. It is intended that it should clearly define Daphne’s main target group as being children, women, and young people, and should make clear that such categories as social workers, frontier personnel, and the police are not included. My message to you is that there must be no doubt about the fact that Daphne is mainly targeted at women, children and young people, although the others can be involved, as is made clear in Amendment 57 and elsewhere. We continue to demand a European Year against violence against women; it is something that has been being called for for a long time, not least in Daphne I and II, and we are being persistent and consistent in continuing to do so. I will take this opportunity to ask that all forms of violence, without equivocation or exception, be targeted. This is something that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has worked through with the Commission, and I hope that we will be able to come to a final agreement on it with the Finnish Presidency of the Council by the end of the year, as we are indeed willing and ready to do.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, to thank you and seriously urge you to do what you have just been talking about by drafting a legal instrument to actively combat violence against children, women and young people. Today, there was support for this proposal from almost all the groups in this House. I ask you to take up this debate now in order that we may achieve a result without delay. You can rely on our cooperation.

 Mr President, what is at issue here is the funding of the programme. When we vote on Amendment 74, which has been tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we will be voting on the sum of EUR 125 million, and so I ask that we vote on this amendment first. If it is adopted, then Amendment 71 – which refers to the sum of EUR 120 million – will lapse.

Homophobia and racism have no place in Europe. Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community prohibits any discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Particularly following the scandalous and distressing events in Moscow which took place on the fringes of the Gay Pride rally in May 2006, it is imperative that we send a strong signal regarding tolerance in Europe. Last Saturday in Warsaw at the equality parade, I demonstrated against the increasing homophobic tendencies that are particularly prevalent in Poland, which is an EU Member State. The right of European citizens to sexual self-determination is a human right which is defended by us social democrats here in Parliament, whether in Warsaw, Riga or Frankfurt. I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution.

 Mr President, actions speak louder than words, and I want to thank Mrs De Keyser most warmly for her very compact report, which considers every angle, not least the imbalance of power between women and men as the cause of many conflicts. While we see women as both perpetrators and victims, we also see solutions, and it is most important that we should recognise that women are often among the first victims of conflicts between states or within them, since they are among the weakest members of society, yet, paradoxically, they find themselves playing the role of the strongest in coping with conflict situations. It was women searching through the rubble of a Germany devastated after the Second World War who were the driving force behind that country’s reconstruction, and yet they were, true to form, again excluded from political responsibility. Wherever in the world there is war, the norm is that women become the victims of sexual violence. In countries such as Iraq and Palestine, they are excluded from assuming political responsibility; in the conflict in Sudan, sexual violence is getting out of hand. For social democrats such as ourselves, then, it is for this reason that the participation of women, through gender mainstreaming, in all missions, as described in UN Resolution 1325, is so enormously important. We want them to have an equal say in all areas of diplomatic policy even before conflicts set in. It is an unfortunate fact, Commissioner, that only three EU missions around the world are headed up by women. Our group is continuing to work on this issue, and we will be using the Gomes report to pursue at greater depth in the diplomatic field, an issue that is of enormous importance for us as a group. We have been addressing the issues of reproductive health, of suicide bombings, and of anti-personnel mines, from the after-effects of which women and children continue to suffer. What we can be sure of is that this report shows us not only that women are per se 
better people, but we want to get actively involved in playing our part, we want to play it ourselves, and this is where Europe must lead the way.

 Mr President, I am glad indeed that Mrs Plassnik and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner are still here. Last weekend there were violent excesses against peaceful demonstrators in Moscow. I think it is most necessary that we as the European Union say that this should not be allowed to happen in a country that currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. This issue concerns a strong partner of the European Union. We will be demonstrating on Friday afternoon in Brussels and in many other places in Europe against the violations of human rights committed against peaceful demonstrators. On the weekend after next in Warsaw, Gay Pride will take place, and I have heard statements from officials in Warsaw that there could be excesses here too and that anyone who participates must be prepared for the possibility of violence. I will march and fly the flag for the rights – guaranteed by Article 13 – of everyone in the European Union. I hope that many people will take part and say: there is no place for intolerance in the European Union. Let us fly the flag!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the programme to promote active European citizenship, used correctly, has the potential to become a very valuable tool for bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens and combating Euroscepticsm. With a budget of less than EUR 300 million for seven years and with 36 countries involved, expectations are high. Nevertheless, in view of its four different action fields, implementation will be difficult. For this reason, I should like to thank Mr Takkula, who has made real efforts to achieve a balance and also to refrain from making any cuts in the small budget, for example in the field of town-twinning activities. These are citizens’ projects that strengthen European consciousness and identity at grass-roots level. We want to promote the active, civil-society projects in the EU, in which there is so much idealism: they need our attention and support. We want to support the public-relations activities of the Europe Houses and of the institutes operating throughout Europe. I would ask the Commissioner to incorporate our proposals. The fourth action is also very important to me, as a German Social Democrat. I hail from Nuremberg, the city of the Nazi Party conferences. In the present day, the city is making efforts to shake off its old image and restyle itself as a city of human rights. Anyone wanting to actively shape the future needs to be aware of his past, which is why action 4, ‘active European remembrance’, is so important. We need to remember the victims of the violent Nazi and Stalinist regimes, and also the relevant places and memorial sites. We also need to remember all the victims of dictatorships, however, and therefore I would ask you to support Amendments 54 and 55 by my group. The reason for this request is that we should be very careful not to play victims off against one another.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this House has, for a long time, been calling for an Equality Institute; not only do we raise this demand every year on International Women’s Day, but we also want to see real improvements in the quality of equality policy, and that is why we endorse the Commission’s proposal. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with the object of guaranteeing broad support, entrusted the work on the report to the two major groups, in the persons of Mrs Sartori and myself. We agreed on compromises and jointly tabled a series of amendments generally aimed at slimming down the administration and ensuring the primacy of policy-making. We want to avoid duplication and prevent overlaps with other agencies. We want to ensure that all the expertise on equality issues that is to be found in the national institutes – the gender experts, the universities, the non-governmental organisations – can be drawn together into one network. We have proposed additions to the Commission proposal with the intention of involving civil society in an advisory role. The Gender Institute will have a very important role to play in ensuring that we, as political decision-makers, can speedily draw on the results of gender research and thereby improve the lawmaking process. It is intended that the Institute should be a centre of excellence, and independent, although it will, of course, follow the guidelines set by the European Union and by our policies. It will be a milestone, and will have an effect far beyond the borders of the European Union, but there is a risk that people will say – as some Members of this House are already doing – that we do not want an institute specifically for gender issues, but that it should, instead, be combined with the Human Rights Agency. The great danger of that, I think, would be that it would no longer be ensured that the European Union’s programmes were visible to the public. As with the equality programme, what is needed is an instrument with an outward effect. I do not believe that PROGRESS has enabled us to ensure visibility, and we must have the certainty that the Equality Institute will do that. What is needed is a small, high-class institute that works to powerful effect. Saying ‘no’ to it today would be a major setback to the European Union’s equality policy, and a major setback too to the equality roadmap that was so convincingly presented last week. It was Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, who set out the timetable last week. Let us, by saying ‘yes’ to the Sartori/Gröner report today, ensure that the timetable can be kept to and that there are no delays.

. – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the football World Cup is being held in Germany under the slogan, ‘a time to make friends’. The sporting community is getting ready for it, but so are organised gangs of traffickers – getting ready to ship thousands of women to Germany and exploit them there. These women will be enticed to Germany with false promises and then forced into prostitution. Poverty is one of the main causes of this, and that is where we must start, but making people welcome in Germany must also mean protecting women in need rather than turning a blind eye to their plight. Up to 800 000 women worldwide fall victim to people-trafficking, and 100 000 of them come from the EU. Although nobody has any idea how many of them will be in Germany this summer, we should show the people-traffickers the red card. What I expect you to do, Commissioner Frattini, is to take the proposals that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality put forward in the Prets report and in the plan of action against trafficking in women, and use them as the basis for practical action. If the women’s organisations’ campaign for multilingual telephone hotlines is to be supported, it will need funding. Victim protection schemes need to be put in place. Reference has already been made to the way in which the Member States have been no more than half-hearted in their transposition of the 2002 Asylum Directive, and pressure needs to be brought to bear upon them. Belgium has said that the right to remain will be accorded to women who are willing to take the witness stand and who want to get out of prostitution, and that they will be given help in order to do that. That is quite splendid. If the modern-day trade in women is to be effectively combated, then Europol will have to become more involved, and there are of course things that the sporting associations can do; that is why we rely on their cooperation in appealing to the fans to keep their eyes open and do their bit, as they must. To demand special visas for women is to shoot from the hip, and I am not in favour of that, so please give some more careful thought to what you propose to do.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Social-Democratic Group has taken on the task of drawing up Mrs Estrela’s own-initiative report and carrying out the mid-term review, and it has found that the gender dimension is being short-changed in the Lisbon Strategy. The motto ‘equal pay for equal work’ has already been mentioned. We have had that on paper for years, but it has not been put into practice. The reality is an EU average of 15% to something over 30%. Things cannot go on like that. In business, women are largely absent from executive positions. We even have good models outside the European Union – take Norway, for one. In Norway, the government has passed a law requiring 40% of supervisory board members in quoted companies to be women. Have the courage to take such initiatives, Commissioner, and make this part of the road map. The demand for independence must not be left only on paper. The social partners must be more active here. I am getting sick and tired of always hearing that it is because of women’s qualifications. As we have already heard, women are now better educated and there are far more women graduates than male graduates, but we have still not broken through the glass ceiling. There must therefore be other reasons why women are not coming through, and I have to say there is a lack of political will here. Again and again there has been much talk of good will here in this House and in the Commission. So where is the snag? Why is it that women – even in politics – are still not achieving the breakthrough? Here Mrs Estrela’s report is helping to stir us up again and to ensure that the role of men changes. Reconciling family and working life and gender mainstreaming are not matters for women alone. I am therefore asking you to increase the pressure. I am asking the Commission at long last to present the road map and not merely to describe the facts again but to be really courageous and move forward. The new Gender Institute will be an important and courageous step. It will enable us to demonstrate that Europe is taking equality seriously. I am therefore asking you to translate words into action. The Lisbon Model and the Lisbon Strategy can only be successful if women are fully integrated.

 Mr President, attacks on homosexuals are bad news, and we are getting that news from every corner of the European Union. The Vice-President, Commissioner Frattini, has told us what means the Commission has at its disposal to deal with homophobia and what it is actually doing with them, but what I should like him to tell us is whether that is meant to be enough. Are we really meant to find it acceptable that discrimination in the Member States should go unpunished and that they should fail to transpose the anti-discrimination directives? That is why there is a need for a build-up of political will, and this debate helps to bring that about. Five groups have come together and agreed on a text that denounces discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and which is intended to protect homosexuals, lesbians, transgendered people and bisexuals. The fact is, though, that more needs to be done; transposing the anti-discrimination directives cannot be something that Member States are left to do as and when they feel like it, and – as has already been said – if their authorities interfere with the right to demonstrate by, for example, banning gay pride marches, then they have to be called to account. Fundamental rights need to be reinforced and must apply not only in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain, where the rights of same-sex couples are fully recognised, but throughout the European Union too. I am absolutely outraged by what I have just heard said about the right to adopt being under attack. What determines whether or not a child will develop and flourish is the parents’ love and devotion, not their sexual orientation. That is where discrimination starts, and, although – thank God – we punish it, there are powerful voices in places like the Vatican who speak out in its defence, thereby encouraging even more flagrant manifestations of homophobia. I will therefore close by saying that morality is a private matter for private citizens themselves, but what we in this House have to do is defend the law, and that is what five groups are doing. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I speak for the Socialist Group in this House when I say that we are grateful to Mrs Prets and all the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights for their collaboration on this report. We have tabled many proposals as to how the battle against trafficking in women may be waged. We are alongside you one hundred per cent, Commissioner Frattini, if you take decisive action against this modern scourge. We have to drain this swamp and take action, and, with the action plan and with the help and cooperation of other bodies such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the United Nations, we will be able to do just that. There are plenty of proposals in the report that we can take up, and they need to be implemented now. Funding needs to be made available; Europol must be equipped with powers to act; a police task force needs to be set up: all these things can help. During the December part-session, half of the Members in this House supported the establishment of helplines for children. We want the Daphne programme to carry on being an effective instrument, but as something separate from the prevention of drug use. That is another issue, and every bit as important, but it needs to be dealt with separately. Where this is concerned, Commissioner, you have our backing. None of these things can be delayed for any longer. This was an issue that concerned both your predecessor, Mr Vitorino, and Mrs Gradin; thank heavens there are rather more people interested in it now. We also, however, have the World Cup football to look forward to, and that will prove to be another test. Germany is expecting no fewer than 40 000 additional prostitutes, supposedly to meet the needs of the men who will be going to watch the games, and the fact that these women will not be working of their own free will means that something needs to be done. We will continue to consider this issue in the Women’s Committee and will not stand idly by. What should go forth from today’s debate is a clear message to the organisations that we support women in their campaign and will not shrink back from raising the issue of demand for prostitutes in specific terms. Let us address this problem together and, not least by collecting the relevant data, as also with concrete policy measures, at last make this grey area the subject of headlines and make the public aware of it.

 Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude to the House for the endorsement given to this written statement by some 400 Members. There has been support across all party and national boundaries for the idea that there should be one telephone number in Europe that children can call in order to express their worries and needs. In so doing, we are giving hundreds and thousands of disadvantaged children a great big Christmas present, and I hope that the Commission is listening very carefully to this appeal. I hope that we will not leave it at that, but that the worries and needs of the weakest members of our society will continue to spur us into action. My warm thanks to all those who have made this commitment and will continue to do so in future.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner: it is nice that she is introducing the draft to Parliament after the press is already familiar with it. The enhancement of European content will meet with ample support, and two readings will give us sufficient time to then discuss this in detail. Variety is Europe’s strength – we cannot compete with the US market there, nor do we want to – but it is of course also its weakness. In my opinion, we cannot have product placement in films in the same way as the US. After all, the market always determines the way products are represented in films. There are no objections to a person driving a car, but when it comes to a situation where product placement is only available to those with the fattest wallets, something has gone wrong. We also agree that advertising has no place in children’s programmes. It is only the boundaries that are blurred; that much is clear. Where should the boundaries be drawn? I think that, once the door is opened to this, it will no longer be possible to contain it. Therefore, there will be very great resistance to product placement and the blurred boundaries. We shall have to discuss that further at the two readings.

 Mr President, having just come through, I find myself momentarily rather beside myself because there is, in the passageway from the Winston Churchill building – through which I have just come – an exhibition that lumps together the termination of pregnancy and concentration camps. I am outraged that such a thing is again being allowed in the European Parliament. (Applause)
 Even if this exhibition has been authorised, I ask that a stop be put to it at once. There are pictures there that dishonour all women, and I ask that they be removed right now. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, there is much agreement in this House where your proposals are concerned. Cooperation has been excellent. We have heard what young people have been saying to us, first through the European elections and then through the referendums. If we want to make a success of European policy, it is with young people that we have to start. The new ‘Youth in Action’ programme gives pride of place to the promotion of active citizenship, and the 73 amendments that this House has put forward are intended to make some further improvements to your proposal. We want to respond to what young people themselves told us in the course of the consultation process, and in so doing we are taking the most important step, namely fostering solidarity and mutual understanding among young people, supporting the new neighbourhood policy and bringing together the various interested parties at national, regional and European level. As regards the five actions comprised in the new programme, and which you, Commissioner, have just outlined, we have proposed – in contrast to ‘Lifelong Learning’ – that minimum funding be provided for each individually, with at least 30% of the budget going to traditional youth exchange in Action 1, 23% to the European Voluntary Service, and 4% to the new ‘Youth for the World’ action, which does of course have a similar end in view, not to mention 15% for Action 4, ‘Youth workers and support systems’, and at least 4% for support for policy cooperation, which includes Youth Week. Those who are any good at mental arithmetic will have figured out that some 24% of the overall budget is left over, and this is in order to give the Commission flexibility and to make it possible for more to be set aside for Youth Week in one year and to do more for voluntary service or direct youth exchange in another. It is vitally important that flexibility should be built in. What we also require of the Commission, though, is that this programme be made less bureaucratic. We want the youth associations to be able to plan ahead with confidence, to be able to plan for periods of several years rather than for only one. We want them to get the money without delay and for no more than four months at the most to elapse between the application being made and the money being paid out. This sort of flexibility makes a positive impact on associations, particularly on the smaller youth associations, and enables us to achieve our objectives. As you have mentioned, we want, as before, to prioritise the original age group for participants. The focus should therefore not be on the borderline cases, the thirteen and thirty-year-olds, who might perhaps be able to take part under special circumstances, but should, as before, be on the core group of those aged between 15 and 18. We would like to see a rather larger budget; to give one example, I find it incredible that we, in the European Union, spend EUR 6.5 billion on subsidising sugar production, but, when it comes to learning throughout life, youth exchanges, and culture, our investment still amounts to peanuts. It is for that reason that Parliament advocates, for ‘Youth in Action’, an increase in funding and the relaxation of the constraints of the Böge report to EUR 1.128 billion. I regard that as modest enough, and we have to set down clear markers here. Anti-discrimination policy and youth seminars get a good reception from young people and our amendments are intended to put them centre stage, along with the involvement of disadvantaged young people and the opportunity for all young people to participate, not merely theoretically, but also in practice, irrespective of their nationality or race, of their gender or sexual identity, of where they live, of what they do for a living, or even of whether they are out of work. This is about the building up of intellectual activity, linguistic skills and intercultural learning and their implementation in practice. Ought young people not be at least as much worth to us as a fraction of what is spent on subsidising the cultivation of tobacco? I intend to make a nuisance of myself, particularly to the Council, for as long as it takes for a change of mind to kick in. It is not enough to conclude a Youth Pact; it also has to be implemented! That is the first step.

 The right-wingers’ rejection of the directive to protect workers from optical radiation testifies to a high degree of cheap opportunism on their part and represents a stab in the back for those affected by it. Serious consideration of the dramatic increase in the incidence of skin cancers among workers – over 90 000 cases according to German trade associations and a figure that has increased tenfold since the 1970s – cannot but result in action! To radiation, national borders present no obstacles. That is why I vote for European regulation to protect workers and against the Christian Democrat motion for the rejection of the Common Position. I cast my vote in favour of a European solution that lays down the maximum level of protection for workers who are exposed to optical radiation. Dramatic changes in climate make it necessary that more attention be given even to natural radiation. The rapid rise in the incidence of skin cancer in Australia should be a warning to us in Europe.

 Mr President, one of the fundamental principles of Community law is the equal treatment of women and men. All the directives relating to this have made a decisive contribution in improving the position of women, who make up 52% of our population and thus constitute the majority. Grateful though I am to Mrs Jöns for having reinforced this aspect of the PROGRESS programme, I do take the view that the amalgamation of the five areas of the social agenda is politically mistaken and must not be allowed to remain unchanged. Gender equality should have a free-standing programme of its own. There are six arguments in favour of this: firstly, the Constitutional Treaty reinforces equality policy; secondly the equality programme, like the budget for it, was formerly a matter for the Committee on Women’s Rights, and quite rightly too. Thirdly, the awaited creation of the Gender Institute, gender mainstreaming and a relevant and free-standing equality programme will, in matters of equality policy, make the EU and this House of ours very visible to women; all women will see that Europe is actively working for them. Fourthly, the Women’s Committee remains a driving force for the rights of our female citizens and will not agree to those rights being undermined by such things as the planned amalgamation, with effect from 2008, of the DAPHNE anti-violence programme with the programme against drugs, which amounts to an open assault upon women’s policy. Fifthly, gender mainstreaming must be consistently applied in all PROGRESS’s pillars, whether in employment, social protection, working conditions or the fight against discrimination, for women are still subject to discrimination in many areas, and, sixthly, what is currently going on runs counter to the Barroso Commission’s commitment to putting equality high up the agenda. Although PROGRESS puts women back on the social agenda, pigeonholing them under ‘social issues’, the solution to the equality problem is political in nature. We women may have lost the first round, but Parliament’s amendments – and thanks again to Mrs Jöns – have prevented drastic cutbacks in the area of equality of opportunity. Let me warn the Commission, though, that, if equality policy becomes even less visible and is taken even less seriously, then support on the part of women will diminish as well. PROGRESS depends on them.

 Madam President, if Europe wants to be accepted by its citizens, we have to be perceived to be working for them. This is most evident in Category III, and it is there that the Council has made the most swingeing cuts. If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-led and dynamic region in the world, we have to put aside more money in the budget for this. Mr Böge’s report serves to show Parliament the way to go about this, with investment in education, research and youth, and consistent application of gender budgeting – from which, however, we are light-years away! Plans, the Lisbon Strategy, the Youth Pact, ambitious action programmes in research, culture and the media – all these things you adopt and then slash the funding needed for their implementation. If we want people to approve of our policies, we have to act in accordance with them. I am grateful to Mr Pittella for laying bare the contradiction in what the Council is doing, and I call on the Commission to join this House in taking an approach that will equip us with a good budget that will come across clearly to the public.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend to the rapporteur the congratulations of the Socialist Group on her report, which is timely and very sound, and we have had innumerable discussions both with the women’s committee in Turkey and in this House. We have had talks with the NGOs and with the political class and the social partners. All these have resulted in a wide-ranging debate in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and a report supported by almost all the groups. It is very clear from the report that much has been done in Turkey towards complying with the European Union’s acquis
. The new penal code entered into force on 1 June. It must now, of course, be put into effect, and there must be no let-up in the pressure for it to be so, but Turkey must also be given the time in which to do this. From now on, marital rape will be punishable, and honour crimes are now stigmatised as the thoroughly dishonourable and criminal acts that they actually are. It is now for Turkey to take the next step and appoint women to political office. A 4% quota for women in the Turkish parliament is not feasible; a 1% quota in municipal council chambers is minimal to the point of insignificance. This is where Turkish women need our help, and, with the aim of getting this House to send a clear message, the women’s organisations have sent us an urgent appeal, begging us to support them with quotas and with best practice, but above all to put it in a resolution. That, I think, is what we should do. We should also, again and again, denounce violence against women and put it on the agenda. Negotiations are due to commence on 3 October, and this report will have an important contribution to make to them.

 Mr President, this directive deals with the position of women in the labour market. It is therefore primarily addressed to women, and it is we women whose cause is yet again being advanced by the completion of the bonfire of red tape that we promised the public. I hope that we will vote as one tomorrow, and also that the reference to the anti-discrimination law was a bit of verbal skirmishing on Mr Wuermeling’s part. A national election is already underway and it has nothing to do with this directive. According to Article 119 of the Treaty, European law promises women equal rights, and they need to see these put into effect. Many women Members of this House have made reference to the areas in which they have not been, and to the need for awareness to be raised of the direct and indirect discrimination that goes on. Discrimination may well begin in people’s heads, but its removal requires that we change the rights, and laws and their transposition into national law will follow. There is a need for political will, and this Commission has demonstrated that it possesses it. This House is contributing its own. I hope that, tomorrow, we will be able to get what we want and send women in the EU the message that we are still the engine that moves women’s rights forward in Europe.

 This House has for many years been calling for a single Statute for its Members. We have, on innumerable occasions, been critical of the extreme divergences in the remuneration of those who represent Europe’s people. The process of making the EU more democratic must be of equal value to all its Member States. Now, for the second time, the Council has presented us with a compromise proposal, which we, the elected Members of this House, are supposed to agree to. It envisages basing MEPs’ income on a good third of the income of a European judge. Absent from this proposal, in my view, is any clear statement about what value Europeans themselves attach to the financial independence of their MEPs, and these same MEPs are instead exposed to an unworthy media campaign. At a time when all pro-European forces are concentrating on overcoming the problems involved in modernising the new, enlarged Europe, I do not intend expending any energy on ‘Project Statute’ if it means that we are reproached for feathering our own nests. I will be abstaining from the final vote.

 Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament strongly supports the new proposal to extend the framework programme on gender equality by one year and to secure funding for women’s organisations active at European level, as well as the moderate increase in funding of EUR 1.5 million. The Commission has put forward proposals in the 2007–
2013 Financial Perspective for a new programme for employment and social policy under the name of PROGRESS, however, and this is where our views diverge. PROGRESS provides for substantial cuts to the budget for equal opportunities, which is the fifth pillar of this programme. At the same time, however, the equality of men and women is given pride of place as one of the EU’s values and objectives in Articles 1 to 3 of the Constitutional Treaty that is currently being put to popular vote. The Constitution also sets out the measures that we should take, and so it would be a serious mistake to consign women’s issues to the field of social policy. Women account for 52% of the EU’s population, which means that this is not a question of minority rights, or of social or employment policy. While gender mainstreaming must be implemented in all these fields, for example anti–
discrimination and employment, equal opportunities must continue to be an issue in its own right, and one that is visible to women. Our main priority is that we should work together towards this goal and use the time remaining until 2007 to present a separate programme. We need to understand – and this is a point I should like to make to Commissioner Špidla and the House – that women are watching us. We have always said that our strategy was twofold, namely gender mainstreaming in all policy areas and separate EU–
sponsored programmes to promote women’s interests, until such a time as equal opportunities become a reality. I would urge you to take this factor into consideration, and to help ensure that a separate programme is drawn up.

 Neither of the two candidate countries has made the expected progress in implementing the acquis communautaire
. The issue of women’s rights has been neglected during the accession negotiations, whether with regard to the labour market, participation in social processes or violence against women. Improvements in the situation of children leave a great deal to be desired, particularly in Romania. I believe that human rights and humanitarian issues such as these are more important than problems relating to the EU’s institutional framework, for example the question of Parliament’s budgetary rights, even though it was only when Parliament had made certain that these rights would be fully respected that a last-minute compromise was reached. Furthermore, as I have already stated on several occasions, I do not feel able to vote in favour of another enlargement until the Constitution has entered into force. It is for these reasons that I will vote against Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU, particularly since we are still 20 months away from 2007, the envisaged date of accession.

 Mr President, today being International Women’s Day, it is an important opportunity to draw attention to the fact that women around the world are insufficiently involved in decision-making. I am glad that the Commission, too, will now be joining in our debate, as the questions raised will focus on how the evaluation of the platform for action at Beijing ten years ago has developed as our most important foundation for measures in connection with women’s rights around the world. As I speak, the UN is in session in New York, assessing the outcomes of the Platform for Action, and in this the European Union has a very important part to play. As a rapporteur in Beijing, I did of course follow closely what the European Union was doing and the action it was taking; I did so again five years later at ‘Beijing + 5’ in New York, and now, with a delegation from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am doing the same with ‘Beijing + 10’. We see it as an important step, and one on which I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency, to use good and adroit negotiation as a means of defending women’s rights there. The United States of America has pushed hard for the platform for action to be renegotiated in order to spark renewed controversy and gain renewed influence, particularly in matters affecting twelve critical areas – prime among them being reproductive and sexual rights, which, in practical terms, means abortion. The negotiating skills of the Luxembourg Presidency, among others, made it possible to prevent this, but I find it regrettable that the Commission did not put on much of a show in New York, being represented only by one Commissioner, or, perhaps on one occasion, by Mr Barroso. The questions that we are putting today to the Commission and the Council in those twelve different areas must serve to evaluate progress and, of course, also to highlight the deficiencies in these areas that have yet to be made good. Here in the EU, we have had one report from each Member State; the Luxembourg Presidency has held a conference to collate them and to undertake an assessment. Progress has certainly been made. Where political participation is concerned, we have been successful in raising consciousness. In some countries, there have been breakthroughs; in your country, Mr President, that being Spain, the government is establishing parity between men and women. In the last elections to the European Parliament, we did not experience the invasion we had dreaded and expected after the ten new Member States sent observers of whom only 14% were women. Here, then, things really have been moving. European countries have performed very well in the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s assessment of participation in governments, even though women’s participation stands at only 10% in France and Italy. For that reason, women, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, are still calling for quotas, which are necessary if women are to have a share in political decision-making processes. To that our European anti-discrimination policy has given a great deal of impetus, even though its implementation in the Member States still leaves much to be desired. Our various actions against violence, such as the Daphne and STOP programmes, have highlighted the need for violence to be curtailed. We have afforded ample consideration to trafficking in women, thereby making it clear that we cannot accept a situation in which up to 500 000 women are smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited. We find it completely unacceptable that practically one woman in five in Europe should be at least once in her life, the victim of some form of violence. What we want is a Gender Institute to underpin our work and supply us with statistical data to help combat various forms of discrimination in even more practical and tangible ways. Alongside the integration of women in the labour market, the encouragement of women in time-tested ways, and gender mainstreaming as a framework policy, we want an equal opportunities programme. Something that we certainly want, and on which neither the Commission nor the Council have budged, is a European Year for Combating Violence, which ought to be announced in 2006. Nothing has happened so far; we do not even have practical proposals as to what form the Gender Institute should now take, and so this is where the Commission and the Council still have a great deal of work to do on implementation. Goodwill is not enough on its own; what we need is action. Symbolism is fine on one day – International Women’s Day; we now have 365 of them, full of work to be done. (Applause)

 Mr President, millions of people around the world are currently observing International Women’s Day, and that includes Turkey, where, as we have heard, their demonstration was brutally suppressed. I thank you for responding so rapidly and for sending out the right message. We have to see the women of Turkey given their democratic rights, or else the country’s accession will come to nothing. Something else I would like to mention is that this House will, tomorrow, be discussing the outcomes of the UN’s ‘Beijing + 10’ Conference. The debate will begin tomorrow morning with an oral question, and the vote will be held at midday. President Barroso has now sent out invitations to an exchange of information with ten members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality to be held at that same time. This I regard as an affront, and none of our Members should have any part in such a meeting, held here in this House but ignoring the vote. I ask that it be made clear to Mr Barroso that we have to do our duty here in the plenary, and it is there that we will be debating women’s rights.

 Mr President, Commissioner, you have depicted for us the situation ten years on from this House’s adoption of the report on combating poverty among women in Europe, and have taken stock of it; I have to say that we have achieved a fair bit, and a lot has happened in Europe. One might say that, at the Beijing World Conference on Women, Europe stood out as a beacon of women’s rights. We have always spearheaded them, and thus it is particularly painful that we have been unable to bring about any decisive reduction in the gap between the poor and the well-off in Europe. I see poverty as having a woman’s face, and the facts make it apparent to all that there is still much to do to change that situation. Women still make up the majority in the groups at risk: the long-term unemployed, the lone parents and the impoverished elderly. It is particularly painful and tragic that children are at particularly high risk of poverty in our prosperous society, and let me just say that I was therefore particularly outraged by Mr Buttiglione’s discriminatory remarks about mothers who bring up children on their own. That is something we must not put up with nor allow to go unchallenged. It is in education that the gender gap becomes glaringly apparent. A reading of UNESCO’s figures reveals that the lack of education is one of the key factors forcing women into poverty. Another factor in Europe is that we women are employed under insecure conditions; there is also the exceptionally high incidence of violence in these social groups. Maternal mortality is on the rise, and the lives of women living in poverty are at particular risk. Women are also especially hard hit by the epidemic of HIV and Aids, currently representing the majority of those newly infected worldwide. All these aspects we have to take into account and redouble our efforts to deal with them. The economic losses resulting from them are enormous, and so, when implementing the Lisbon strategy, and on the points to which the Commissioner referred, we should really press the point home that the key element underpinning the European social model is, in the final analysis, women’s development and support for them, and that we in Europe really do have the most generous resources for further empowering women and thereby making European society more human. We on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality demand that these points be incorporated in future major projects on the European social model, in the Progress programme, in the Structural Funds and in the new employment guidelines. The Constitutional Treaty provides us with good instruments for this purpose; let us make it come alive and, by means of gender mainstreaming, give women pride of place in our deliberations.

 Mr President, I too wish to thank the Commissioner for having, over recent years, supported the Committee on Women’s Rights in its endeavour to advance gender budgeting. As our committee does not have that many Budget lines to administer, this horizontal policy is of particular importance to us. I have to say, however, that I agree with Mr Prodi’s assessment that successes have not been conclusive everywhere. As with the Lisbon strategy, we have given gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming a fixed place in the Structural Funds, but, at the end of the day, only 6% goes to gender-centred projects. Hence it has been our great concern that the amendments should be used to achieve progress in this area by laying down minimum margins in the major programmes, in MEDA, in the major cooperation programmes, including those with other countries, in aid for Afghanistan and for Iraq. It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets was unwilling to go down this road; it stated that part of these sums was to be used for gender-centred projects, but actually lacked the courage for this. If we really want change, minimum rates must be laid down. I think more debate on this is called for, and we need to muster the courage to do this. Where the Committee on Women’s Rights does have competences is in the field of gender mainstreaming under the Framework Programme, but it is again and again becoming apparent to us that we lack reliable data on how EU funds are spent on women and on men. It is therefore very important that we should get the gender institute started. Although the Council has voted in favour of the idea, the whole thing is meant to be run in a budget-neutral way, in other words, it is not allowed to cost anything, and women are allowed to do as they like if it does not. That is not acceptable, so what we want is to introduce at least a token entry for the gender institute. I would also like to mention a project from the DAPHNE programme, that being the European Year against Violence against Women. Many approaches have been made to the Commission seeking its support for this, but if you want something done, you do it yourself, so let us declare the ‘Year against Violence’!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Parliament, too, ‘Women on Waves’ are having an impact. Why is this so? Ever since the end of August, the Portuguese Government has been preventing the Dutch vessel Borndiep
 from entering a port on the west coast of Portugal. This Dutch vessel belongs to the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation, which Portuguese women’s organisations have invited to Portugal to give out information on abortion, contraception, and the RU 486 abortion pill, which is the least traumatic method of terminating pregnancy. The Portuguese Government evidently regards this as putting Portuguese women in grave danger, or else it would not have taken this drastic course of action. The Portuguese Government thought it was worth violating two of the European internal market’s fundamental freedoms: the right to information and the right to freedom of movement within the EU. This is a serious political incident; never before has the right to freedom of movement been violated for purely political reasons. We in the Socialist Group cannot accept this, and so we are asking the Council and the Commission what they are proposing to do to prevent this unprecedented occurrence in the history of the European Union from being repeated. I see this as an important question and one that has to be put to the incoming Commission right now, and we want to see it made perfectly clear that this is not acceptable. The incident has had repercussions right across Europe; it is all over the media, for there is of course more to it behind the scenes. The fact of the matter is that women in the European Union really are having their freedom curtailed, and we cannot accept the creeping rollback that is going on here. We see from the Treaties that, at the level of the nation state, the freedom of movement may be restricted only in the case of a danger to public safety, from terrorism for example, but is that what is at risk in this particular instance? Is women’s health threatened by an epidemic? If so, perhaps it is an epidemic of free thought or of the freedom to decide; I adopt this rather ironic tone in view of the very different views expressed even in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, where the Christian Democrats wanted this case to have a lower profile. I do think, though, that it is a very important one, and one that needs to be dealt with here in the European Parliament. We want all women in Europe to know how to get access, in the safest possible way, to contraceptives and terminations and to information about them and the safest ways to use them and then to be free to decide for themselves what they want. It is clear that this case, at the end of the day, not only has the most profound effect on individual women’s right to choose, but that it is also and at the same time a highly political act, and that is why we cannot accept the violation of two of the four basic freedoms. Although we want Mr Barroso to say where he stands on this, I would also ask Commissioner Wallström to add her weight to the women’s case. Mr Barroso is presenting eight women as Commissioners and claims to want to give women a better future, but it may be that the substance of his programme will suffer a setback. That is something we want to prevent, and that is why we are having this debate today. I hope that both the Commission and the Council will clearly state their positions on this. If they do not, then I think the Borndiep
 or the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation ought to write a thank-you letter to the Portuguese Government for giving us the opportunity to discuss the principle whereby women must be able to decide freely when and how they want to receive information on the termination of pregnancy and what they do with it, and, at the end of the day, also have a free choice as to when and how they want to have a child. This is a fundamental issue, and it needs to be discussed in this House. (Applause)

 Mr President, one aspect of this debate that angers me is that neither the Council nor the Commission have had a word to say about women, who make up the majority of the population in Iraq, not a word about their exclusion from the transitional government or the process of democratisation. OK, so we want free elections, but what about Iraq’s female majority? The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality organised a hearing with Iraqi women, at which the hope was expressed that we would provide outside help, highlighting painful issues as we did in Afghanistan, and that women could be involved in the process of democratisation. For that reason, we women in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want this aid with reconstruction to be tied to the stipulation that women be fully involved. No matter what the terror, hope must not be allowed to die, and it is through women and children that it lives on – the hope that they will again be able to work as police officers, as politicians, as doctors, and as university professors, as they did under Saddam, dictator though he was. That, I believe, is why we must not forget, while demanding the immediate release of the hostages, that Iraq’s women, too, have to be set free.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the conciliation procedure relating to the Working Time Directive has failed. In this case, Article 65(5) of the Rules of Procedure provides for the Chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee to make a statement in plenary. For this reason, I will now make a brief statement on the progress of the negotiations on the Working Time Directive. After several trialogues and three sessions of the Conciliation Committee, it became clear in the last session shortly after midnight and shortly before the expiry of the deadline that it would not be possible to come to an agreement. The European Parliament delegation had previously voted with a clear majority of 15 votes in favour, none against and five abstentions to oppose the final conciliation attempt of the Commission. This proposal was not accepted as the basis for a genuine compromise. At the same time, it was also rejected by the Permanent Representatives Committee which was meeting in the neighbouring room. In a letter dated 29 April 2009, the two co-chairmen of the Conciliation Committee informed Parliament and the Council of Ministers that it was not possible to come to an agreement on a joint text within the deadline specified in Article 251(5) of the EC Treaty. I very much regret that the two institutions did not succeed in finding any common ground. However, if we consider the three points which remained in dispute until the end – the opt-out from weekly working time, the conditions of on-call time and the multiple contracts per worker – the differences in positions were so great that there was no possibility of reaching an agreement which would have been compatible with the European Parliament resolution of 17 December 2008. The Council in particular did not move an inch on the question of the opt-out. Parliament offered several compromises which would have given the employers’ side a great deal of flexibility on working times. Parliament was particularly cooperative on the question of the conditions of on-call time, because the majority of Member States, in this case nine, use the opt-out exclusively for on-call time. However, a blocking minority in the Council prevented every attempt to introduce a derogation. Not even a suggestion of an end to the opt-out was accepted. On the subject of on-call time, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has made it clear that on-call time is working time. Even the inactive part of on-call time cannot be considered in whole or in part to be a rest period, as the Council demanded. It was also obvious to the Parliament delegation that on-call time is necessary when a continuation of work is required. The Council was not prepared to accept this restriction. What is the result of this? If a waiter sits in an empty restaurant, this counts as inactive on-call time which will, of course, be evaluated differently. This must not be the case. Taking a flexible approach, Parliament also supported the proposal for a maximum working time of 48 hours per worker and not per contract. In this case we could not even agree on this principle being laid down in a recital. It was clear to the Parliament delegation that no compromise is better than a bad compromise at the expense of the workers. Parliament submitted numerous proposals to the Council until we felt that we had reached the end of our tether. However, there was a group in the Council that was not prepared to compromise in any way. I also believe that at some points the Commission could have submitted proposals which offered more of a balance between the position of the Council and that of Parliament. During this parliamentary term, Parliament has adopted 389 legal acts in the codecision procedure. Of these, 24 were concluded at the third reading following successful conciliation. This demonstrates clearly that there is a culture of cooperation between the institutions. For the first time since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Conciliation Committee has failed to reach an agreement in the case of the Working Time Directive. I hope that the new Commission will very soon present a new proposal which will, I hope, lead to an agreement. Finally, I would specifically like to thank the Conciliation Committee secretariat for its excellent groundwork.

Chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee.

Madam President, I have asked to make few more brief remarks because I believe that it is necessary. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Sedláček, has told us that the Council accepted the proposal at the beginning of last week. I must state quite clearly that the information which we were given in the trialogue was quite different. We received the information that the Commission proposal would not be accepted, that there would be no possibility of an opt-out during the trial period and that the period of six months would not be accepted. It was also made clear that on-call time would not be regarded as a necessary continuation of working time. We were also told exactly what has been said here, that there was a willingness to toe the line. This was not the position of Parliament. I would like to make it clear that we did receive this information. The problem may be that you came later, not until after midnight, but we did receive this information. Secondly, Mr Bushill-Matthews gave the impression that the negotiations were biased and one-sided. I would like to explain one thing. The negotiating delegation consisted of the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, the chairman of the Committee, the shadow rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda, from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself. We were in agreement on every single case. The guidelines in this House ensure that my group does not have the majority in the delegation to the Conciliation Committee. The results were quite clear: 15 votes in favour, none against and five abstentions. The debate today has quite clearly demonstrated that a broad majority of Parliament supports this position. I would not like anyone to go away with this impression of bias.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, may I express my thanks to the rapporteur, Anne Laperrouze, for the truly cooperative manner in which our deliberations were conducted? Let me also extend my thanks to the staff of the secretariats for their invaluable contribution. Against the backdrop of the latest gas crisis, the Second Strategic Energy Review is extremely well-timed. Security of supply and solidarity among the Member States must be at the heart of the European energy policy. I firmly believe that it would make a distinct improvement if the call contained in this report for greater diversification of the gas corridors were answered. Moreover, before the end of this year the Commission must also present a proposal for the revision of the Gas Directive of 2004 in order to incorporate a requirement for binding and effective national and EU emergency plans. However, as members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we attach fundamental importance to the duty of EU Member States to keep a special eye, even in normal times, on the most vulnerable consumers in society, namely those who are victims of fuel poverty. There is still a lack of national strategies for tackling this problem. That is why my group has tabled an additional amendment calling on Member States to make real efforts to address this problem. The report emphasises the particular importance of energy saving and energy efficiency. The most efficient and cost-effective ways to improve security of supply are quite clearly to increase energy efficiency and to make energy savings. At the same time we must have ambitious and realistic aims for Europe’s future energy supply. I am pleased to see that we are moving in this direction, for example by calling for the target of a 60% share of renewables in our energy mix by 2050. The report also emphasises the special significance attaching to local initiatives in the quest for a successful climate and energy policy. The Covenant of Mayors has a key role to play in this respect, but it is also important to support other, similar approaches, like the idea of a Covenant of Islands. The bottom line, however, is that our objectives will be difficult to achieve without investments in the infrastructure of energy networks and further liberalisation of the internal market. We need a functioning single energy market with fair competition and with guaranteed free network access and equal distribution rights for all producers. The coming weeks will be crucial in this respect. What we need are the creation and development of a smart electricity network comprising ICT-based combined power stations and decentralised energy production. That is the only way in which energy resources can be efficiently channelled into the areas where they are really needed. We need a European ‘supergrid’ that taps into and links the enormous potentials in the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean region. Where the report is untenable, however, is in its call to the Commission to draw up a specific road map for nuclear investments. For this reason my group has tabled an amendment that clearly underlines our common interest in nuclear safety while emphasising that whether Member States invest in nuclear energy must remain their own sovereign decision. My own personal opinion is that we do not need nuclear energy.
 President. − 
 My pleasure!

– The next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and on the French initiative at the UN on the decriminalisation of homosexuality. We have one small problem: the Council representative, Mrs Yade, cannot join us yet. She is on an aeroplane somewhere near Strasbourg, but is unable to land. I suggest that we start with the Commission and then proceed to the debate, and that Mrs Yade be given the floor in due course.

 Mr President, first, my compliments on the rapporteur’s splendid work. My dear Claude, a most sincere thank you! These guidelines now offer a great opportunity for us to push ahead with a new impetus with the energy changes that Europe needs. We know that climate change, which is proceeding dramatically, demands a clear focus on renewables and energy efficiency. What has been presented to us today as a compromise with the Council is a very good result. The threat posed to successful national support schemes by the certificate trading that the Commission proposes has been deleted. The flexibility that is essential if we are to reach, and I hope exceed, the 20% target together is provided by genuine cooperation mechanisms. What is more, the national action plans that set out the strategy for the increase in renewables have been significantly sharpened. On the one hand, the European Parliament has considerably improved the ecological criteria for biofuels, and on the other hand, it has added social criteria. I therefore thank the rapporteur and I thank the whole delegation for this outcome.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, warm thanks to the rapporteur, Britta Thomsen. It is a good report. I hope it will be adopted on Wednesday by as clear a majority as in committee, for in spite of the somewhat critical remarks by Mr Chichester we achieved a broad, almost unanimous majority in favour of the report in committee. As I said, it is a good report, and it is also an important and necessary one. You know that the Commission is currently preparing a framework directive to implement the spring Summit decisions on achieving a target of 20% of renewables by the year 2020. The Commissioner has spoken to you about it and it was good to hear him say clearly that the Thomsen report will play a relevant role. What is the issue now and what is really important? Firstly, we have successful directives, especially on electricity but also on biofuels. So the important thing now is to take up and to strengthen and improve those successful directives, as pointed out in the Thomsen report. Secondly, we must commit ourselves to what the Commissioner already agreed in plenary last year, which is to include the area of heating and cooling, in order to minimise the deficits we have in that sector and improve market penetration. Hitherto we have taken a clear sectoral approach, and I believe we must not forgo this. It is also extremely important to ensure that the national action plans include really clear sectoral targets, binding targets, to ensure that here too we have a broadly-based development of the various technologies. It is most important to decide how the 20% are to be assigned among the Member States. That really means we must ensure a fair distribution of burdens, or rather opportunities, a distribution that really is based only on potential and on what has already been achieved, what already exists in the countries concerned. So we really must take a very clear approach here. I am glad that the report states very clearly that we are concerned here only with renewables and not with low-CO2 
energy sources. May I thank Commissioner Piebalgs once again for making that clear. I believe the Commissioner has a major responsibility here. We have seen a genuine new impetus, with the presentation of the electricity directive. I hope the same will happen after the framework directive, which, I hope, we can expect before the end of this year.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said in a smaller round that this debate on the energy package is not necessarily an issue of black or red, left or right. It is, however, full of ideology. We have seen this again today. I would like to bet my fellow Member from Germany, Mrs Harms, that in four years’ time we will not be tabling a fourth package, but will be managing with the instruments that we have: regulating the market, making the grids more accessible – things that have already been successful in the Federal Republic of Germany. It is possible to see positive examples. I am in favour of us simply keeping things as they are and using the instruments that have been given to us, ensuring that they are implemented. Secondly, I would like to argue in favour of the newly founded Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators receiving and utilising definitive powers and applying best practice from the Member States. If that happens then I have no doubt that we will achieve a good result.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, CO2
 is not poisonous, nor is it explosive, but CO2 
does have one unpleasant property: if it gets into the atmosphere in large quantities, our climate changes, which is why carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is an important bridging technology. In this respect, Mr Hoppenstedt is right; it is a bridge for the next 50 to 80 years. It is not the non plus ultra
, but it is one part of the solution to our problems. I think we have found a good compromise, at least in terms of the link to the emission trading scheme. The emission trading scheme guarantees that resources will be made available for CCS, and CCS also guarantees that we shall make headway in reducing CO2 
and shall be able to achieve our targets. I think that, alongside efforts by industry to construct this demonstration plant, the Member States need to make an effort to get national legislation transposing this directive under way. Above all, we all need to pursue clarity, for public opinion and for industry, in order to ally people’s fears about CCS. CCS is not a dangerous technology; it is a helpful technology.

 Madam President, I do apologise for my late arrival. There are some very long distances to walk in this building and the lifts can be very slow sometimes. The matter we are discussing today and will vote on tomorrow is not necessarily a question of left or right – although it is true that we also have that type of debate in this Chamber – but rather a disputed question about what instruments will achieve our goal. We are agreed on the goal, and Mrs Niebler has just underlined it: we want more competition on the European market; we want prices to be more transparent; we want pricing that is easy to understand. The instruments to achieve this vary greatly, however. I am among those who proceed on the basis that the option of finding a third way can also be an instrument. We have included these suggestions here and emphasised repeatedly that this has not only initiated the third way, the Council’s original suggestion, but that we have also introduced additional regulatory components because the third way that came to us from the Council was not enough for us. From this angle, we should talk about it again, take stock of ourselves and allow this second and third way as an additional option. What is even more important is that we in Europe achieve uniform regulations, and that the regulatory authorities in the Member States are given consistent competences and independence to implement what we decide here, because in the end, they are the ones who have to respond on the ground. Recent weeks have given us two succinct examples of the Commission’s function of overseeing cartels and competition, although the timing does allow pause for thought. However, a company that violates antitrust law deserves to be punished; that is all there is to it. I do not make any concessions here. Nevertheless, we should discuss whether ownership unbundling is really the instrument we should be equipping ourselves and the regulators with, or whether we should offer more flexibility. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be such that we still achieve a compromise. Otherwise, we will definitely have to work with the Council to seek and find a compromise. Thank you very much and apologies again for being late.

Mr President, Commissioner, Galileo could also be subtitled ‘The Neverending Story’. I hope this subtitle will no longer be an issue after today’s discussion and tomorrow’s vote. The neverending story is now becoming reality. I should like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky specifically for her helpful cooperation, not only in the trialogue negotiations, but also in recent years. She has always been a fair partner and we have found reasonable and sound compromises. Thank you also, of course, to the Presidency and specifically to the representative of the Presidency, who has been conducting the five trialogue negotiations with us. A highly competent, committed woman who, it is safe to say, had quite simply – I suspect – not found this compromise in the Council. My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has always backed the Galileo Project and we are now also backing the result that has been established. I can assure you that there will be no dissenting votes tomorrow from our group and we shall all be voting in favour of it. We must also register the fact – and I would ask you to register this just once more, and it must not appear in the Minutes – that some of the German representatives had to lead the battle with their own government in order to get this going. Mrs Niebler is smiling because she knows what I am talking about. We have managed with this regulation to define clear structures, to find clear responsibility between the Commission, the Supervisory Authority and the ESA. We have the Interinstitutional Panel, on which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have witnessed the progress of this project. We shall be meeting four times a year until 2013 and we all assume that 2013 is a date that we shall likewise be keeping to, and that we shall also be keeping to the budget of 3.4 billion, otherwise it will become difficult to argue. Galileo is – as my fellow Member Mrs Niebler has just stated – not only a satellite navigation system, which enables some citizens perhaps to arrive more quickly at their destination. Galileo is an important technological development for us in Europe and we must maintain our know-how in astronautics, in navigation technology and in electronics. It is therefore important for us to carry out this project here. It is now particularly important that the Commission finalises the call for tenders before the summer. This will be a very difficult task. There will be a decisive settlement. We must give the industry a second chance and the industry must grasp this second chance. I hope that the industry representatives know what is in store for them. We cannot afford a second failure as a result of industry difficulties. I am very anxious about the proposal, the Commission’s action plan and above all about the financial perspective from 2014. Let us in conclusion together assert once again: the PPP is therefore not ultimately washed up. As from 2013/2014 we shall be able to apply the PPP again when using the model. I would not now want to write the PPP off entirely.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly a bit frustrating to see the pretty pass we have gradually come to because of the delay in the Galileo project. It is unquestionably an ambitious venture to conduct a PPP project on a European scale for the first time. However, the small and medium-sized enterprises that took part in the survey conducted through the Green Paper are waiting for the go-ahead to devise, produce and market their applications, so that the jobs they all expect to create can actually materialise. The business community expects us to keep it free from political interference. 'Business does business' is a familiar saying. Time and again, however, although I personally am always very business-friendly, I get the feeling that, whenever the business community hits difficulties, it reverts to appeals for political assistance and shies away from taking risks. Fair sharing of investment, risks and profits is of paramount importance in the PPP model. The proposal in the opinion delivered by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy that funds be held in reserve for the Supervisory Authority in the first instance was intended by us as an admonition to all parties to move forward and make up for lost time. We know full well that this is rather like kicking the dog and meaning the master, to quote an old proverb, but unfortunately we have no other means of exerting pressure. We remain optimistic, and our Socialist Group in the European Parliament also continues to support the project, but our patience is not inexhaustible. I hope the time limits and deadlines that have been set will now serve to bring together the business participants and the requisite consortium. To close with another proverb, actions speak louder than words. It is time to let them speak.
 Norbert Glante,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we keep on reminding ourselves, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe’s economy, employing most of Europe’s workers, yet still not without their problems. I want to point out that the first communication from the Commission in which many problems were addressed reached us in July 1994, followed by recommendations in December of the same year, a second communication in 1998, and then, in 2000, experts found out that not even half of the measures were being put into effect in the Member States. It is necessary to note that, even today, only 55% of them have been, so the Member States have to back up their words with actions. I would like to say something about the transfer of undertakings, which is an important matter to which too little attention is given when considering the problem as a whole, not only on the part of the authorities responsible for Member States’ tax laws but also by the enterprises themselves, which have to start work in good time on the business of transferring their enterprise to a new owner. There is work to be done by all parties involved. Not least in the Seventh Research Programme, this House has taken action in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises; enough words have been bandied back and forth, so now is the time for some action.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group endorses this own-initiative motion, and also the question to the Commission, to which a clear answer has been given, and I hope that this common strategy will enable us to make headway. I have been a Member of this House for quite some time and can remember many attempts being made at this. I also recall the problems to which Mr Belet has just referred. Technological neutrality is a very important term where competition is concerned. We had this sort of problem several years ago, when we realised and addressed that the importance of frequency interference with analog broadcasting, could even, to some extent, hamper our development. I believe we must give a great deal of attention to ensuring that it does not do so. Along with our group, though, I think it very important that the point again be made that we have to succeed in informing the consumers, the public in the European Union, in a transparent, frank and fair manner, and in good time, for it is they who are meant, in due course, to buy and use this technology, and it is their fears that need to be allayed and their resistance that has to be overcome. If you go, as I do from time to time, into the relevant shops, you can see what the manufacturers have on offer, for the digital television sets are there already. The customers have a look at them; they watch a digital-format DVD and enthuse about the picture quality, and then they see an analog TV programme on the same screen and are astonished at how great the difference is. I believe that, if the public are told about the benefits and are given details of when this changeover is to take place, and if the industry aims for market penetration by charging fair prices for these devices, I am optimistic that we will, by 2010, have caught up with our competitors in this field in other parts of the world. What I do see as important, though, is that we make sure that we do not miss the boat when taking our people into the digital era. Quite apart from that, let me say how grateful I am for the customary warm, close and good cooperation with Mrs Barsi-Pataky.
 Norbert Glante,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must, of course, extend particular thanks to Mrs Barsi-Pataky, with whom I have had a very good working relationship. I have been familiar with this subject area for a number years and it is one I have often had to handle. Mrs Barsi-Pataky has got to grips with it with astonishing speed and her cooperation with the shadow rapporteur has been very frank and transparent. The result of that has been a very solid vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, with no votes against the report. What that also shows is that this House is still backing this project, albeit with misgivings here and there. Buying a project, a device, or a system is one thing, but it is just as important to develop one’s own systems and perfect one’s own technology. That I see as being the most important thing about this project. As has been said, the civil project in the European Union is meant to be set up as a public-private partnership, and the experts believe that it will create up to 150 000 jobs. For once, I believe them: their prognosis may well be accurate if we manage to get the project up and running relatively quickly, to find applications for it and produce this solution in Europe rather than importing it. If the forecasts are to be realistic, we simply have to succeed in this. Having a third of the EUR 3.5 billion subscribed from public funds and two-thirds derived from private sources gives Europe the chance of getting this project on its feet. I am optimistic about the prospects for the capital being put up once the projects and the concession contracts are in place. What is, of course, important is that we make the public funds available, and that is where I think we may still come a cropper, for the Council has not yet been able to agree on the Financial Perspective, one of the items in which is – of course – this EUR 1 billion for this project. We have already done our homework, but if the Council cannot manage to make these resources available and to secure funding by the end of the year, then it will be possible neither to get the concession contract signed nor to put any satellites into orbit. If nothing happens by December, then the frequencies are lost to us. We have, I think, had more than one moment of decision with regard to Galileo in the past; it is unfortunate that it was always the Council that put the brake on developments for a while. I hope we will make it this time. My group is giving this proposal its wholehearted backing and will be voting in favour of it. I am aware of Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s oral amendments; having conducted negotiations, I think we can go along with what she proposes. I do very much hope that the Council’s mind will not be as narrow as the checks on the shirt I am wearing today, and apologise for not having had the opportunity to change. I will look more respectable tomorrow.

 Many thanks, Madam President, many thanks, Commissioner. As Mr Surján said, the available budget is tight – 1% of gross national product. Thus we must be all the more careful with the funds, particularly in view of the crisis weighing on people’s minds. We should also attempt to come to decisions together. There is one part of this report on which no joint decisions are possible. This concerns energy supply and energy security. I ask myself whether, at a time when we have to account for every single euro, we should really be investing money in fields where there are market players making billions in profits. Support is being proposed for gas pipelines such as the South Stream project of the Italian group Eni, which made a profit of EUR 10 billion. Nord Stream is a project of E.ON, a German group making a profit of EUR 5 billion, and Nabucco brings together a German, an Austrian and a Turkish company with total profits in excess of EUR 6 billion. Should we really be putting taxpayers’ money into fields in which profits are made? Should conglomerates perhaps be making the relevant investments themselves, and should we perhaps be involving ourselves in only those fields in which support from taxpayers is really desirable? We should not be throwing more money at those who are earning enough as it is. Hence the question: is this really what we want? My second question is as follows. If we do support companies, why Nabucco? Why do we want to create imbalances in this regard? Why do we want to favour a Hungarian company over an Italian one, for example? What is your justification for this? Competitive neutrality is a must, but it is infringed by what you are hoping to adopt. My third point is that the money must be spent in Europe. What is the use of our investing in Azerbaijan? In the face of the crisis, our European citizens want us to provide solution mechanisms. They expect us to provide assistance. We cannot support the Surján report as it stands, as this would mean promoting competition-distorting measures and throwing more money at high-earning institutions and industries. The European Union, with its scant resources, absolutely cannot afford this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, I would like to thank Dan Jørgensen and Alexander Stubb, as they matched the intentions of the Committee on Development one to one. We are very thankful for this because we in the Committee on Development worked very hard on this question. The European Union – the budgets of the European Union itself, combined with the budgets of the Member States – is by far the largest donor of development aid in the world. Nevertheless, with what is happening currently, we find that it is still far too little, and that we really ought to do more. We cannot wait until food and energy shortages in the world blow up in our face and then be surprised that people take to the streets. The money that we donate – and, as I said, we are already the world’s largest donor – needs to be targeted more precisely so that we know that the money actually reaches those who need it and that it is not dissipated and does not disappear. Therefore, we have devoted a great deal of energy to checking whether the funds that we deploy are in fact used for the intended purpose. A key emphasis for Parliament and the Committee is that 20% of the funds have to be used for basic health care and basic and further education, so as to establish a foundation for the future. Thus we have made some progress, but the Commission is still a long way from where we would like it to be. You need to do more work on it; we will keep at you. We called on you to reduce backlogs of payments from the past and indeed, arrears from before 2001 have been reduced by 39% for Europe Aid and by 49% for the European Development Fund. These are good figures, but of course they can only ever be an interim stage. In relation to development policy, we have repeatedly pointed out that it makes no sense at all to maintain two complete systems running in parallel – one for the European Development Fund and one for development aid. It must be integrated in the budget! This is a demand that we are making now and that we will make in future negotiations on financial forecasts. My last point concerns budget assistance. Increasingly, the Commission is granting countries general budget assistance. It is possible to do this, but be careful that you do not experience what we experienced with the current Member States in relation to the Structural Funds – that we transfer responsibility because the states are supposed to take responsibility, and then find out that the systems are not functioning and that ‘nobody’ was responsible for this. Hence my advice: please be certain about what you are doing from the very start. We will be with you all the way, critical but also positive. Overall, sincere congratulations to the rapporteurs and thank you very much for the cooperation.
 Ralf Walter  (PSE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Development is making an effort to set priorities with its expenditure estimated in the budget. We know that development aid, therefore our aid for the poorest people on the planet, is not something that happens by a snap decision and the results appear from nowhere, but there are processes here and we must work continually on these processes. We have emphasised that we want to combat poverty. This means we have to provide people with an education and ensure that they are healthy so that they are able to develop within their own environment, their own country. We have invested a great deal of money in the past to combat malaria, tuberculosis and Aids and we want to help these countries genuinely develop through preventive measures such as, for example, the abolition of small arms, land mines and ABC weapons by setting up a conflict prevention network and cross-border cooperation between the developing countries. It should not be the case here, however – and these are my two pleas to the Council and the Commission – that the Council – simply because a new topic appears on the agenda – says quickly: now we are starting to reorganise everything. We must help Kosovo and we must help Palestine, and we fully agree on this. We have to do this but we should not do it by extracting money from the poorest of the poor and by believing that we could detect something like continuity in this switchyard or that people outside might have the feeling that we are working on helping the poorest of the poor there in a really concentrated manner. New money needs to be forthcoming here and I know we are talking about our taxpayers’ money, but they have to be told this explicitly. If we do this, we shall also be successful. The second item is directed at the Commission. You know exactly what our priorities are for combating poverty. I have just referred to them: provision of health care and basic education so that people are able to earn something themselves at home. We have put a great deal of money into the reserve and we shall not release this money until you have made it clear that you have accepted and adopted Parliament’s priorities. It is not micromanagement that we want to introduce, but we have made a political evaluation, which you have agreed. We shall insist on it and implement it so that, as in other cases of foreign policy it, too, becomes reality and we shall therefore avail of our budget rights and opportunities to exert the appropriate pressure on you.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my warm gratitude for the cooperation between the Committee on Development and the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the two rapporteurs Mr Camre and Mr Garriga Polledo. It is good to see that the House is taking full account of our observations in reaching its decisions. The function of our Committee on Development is to check to see that the funds that we disburse in order to give the world’s most vulnerable people a helping hand and guide them towards self-sufficiency, are put to proper and appropriate use. Public acceptance of this is to a very large degree dependent on the impression not being communicated that this is about this or that potentate getting their bath taps gilded, but rather that the money really does get to the people who actually need it, and so this is what we have scrutinised in very considerable depth. As in so many other contexts, the Court of Auditors has ascertained that serious errors were made in the way the money was spent. We have looked at them all individually and have, of course, been forced to note that errors were made in the procedure for spending the money. Rather, though, than being the sort of errors that might prove disadvantageous to the European Union, they were in fact procedural in nature and in need of improvement if we are to be able to say unequivocally that the funds have been properly used. It has to be said, though, that the discharge process also possesses a political character, in that we are examining whether the Commission has indeed done that which we intended when the Budget was drawn up. We therefore examined whether the environmental legislation really had been made a priority, whether any real improvements had been made on the crisis prevention front, and whether – and about this there was serious disagreement – it was indeed the case that 20% of the funds for basic education and health care had been spent in the developing countries. It has to be said that the figures are on the up, but they are still a long way off the 20% on which we had agreed. The statement that this is all tied together with there being so many donors and institutions to coordinate is reassuring only to a very limited degree. I have to make it clear to the House that the European Union – together with its Member States – is far and away the biggest donor in the world, and that is something we can be allowed to say with self-confidence. At the same time, though, it is not acceptable that someone should get up in front of this House and tell us that they have concentrated on other subject areas, and we hope that the priorities laid down by Parliament and the Council in the framing of their resolutions will eventually be set as such. Our cooperation with the officials from the Commission went very well; firm commitments have been made to the effect that we will, over the course of the year, be given the information and indicators that we need and that there will be evidence of marked improvements. Speaking as someone who has always put a lot into the Budget process, I can spell it out to you that I shall also, when the next Budget is drawn up, be seeing to it that we keep a very close eye out for the improvements in Budget implementation that have been heralded – not only as regards the use of the funds for their intended purpose but also the achievement of policy targets – and that our behaviour, as a parliament, will be determined by whether or not you actually do as you have undertaken to do.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it has to be said, with all due respect, that there is such a thing as the European Parliament and that decisions on Europe’s finances are not left to the Council alone. (Applause)
 I believe that the reason why this House, through the negotiating process, achieved important improvements simply because, from the word go, we did not work on the basis of ‘Here’s the money, now work out how to manage on it’, but instead paid attention to the structures. We took care that we did not, as we had done in the past, fight to put plenty of money in the Budget lines – as we had done with the last, 700 billion, perspective – only to end up with the actual expenditure totalling just over 550 billion; what matters, then, is the quality of the expenditure, and that is why we insisted on making headway on the Budget Regulation front, making things less bureaucratic, less tangled. The money must actually be able to flow, and we must be sure that it gets to the right people; that is why it was vital that we should ensure that the Member States, too, paid attention to the quality of each item of expenditure and considered whether it was getting to the right people. We attached, then, great importance to the quality of the expenditure, and that also means that we want to prevent margins needed elsewhere from being eaten up by the constant creation of new agencies or extensions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy; that is why we had to set boundaries. We have therefore made sure that budgeting will be done in a more structured way in future and that the money can actually be made use of. Secondly, we have made sure of sufficient flexibility in the Budget for new things. Where the Council, regrettably, had left nothing over in the ‘Citizens’ Europe’, we have created a margin, in order that not everything should be used up in the multiannual programme, with no chance of doing anything more. We have improved and extended the pilot projects and the preparatory measures, thereby giving this House greater scope for influence, and we have added 5% for the sake of greater flexibility to the budgets of the multiannual programmes, enabling us to respond to challenges with greater flexibility and precision. We have also managed to achieve things of importance in the individual subject areas, such as lifelong learning, about which everyone always has great things to say, and where you, Mr President-in-Office, seem to believe that there are only 140 000 students left, whereas we have increased their number to 210 000. We have also achieved increases in the trans-European networks and in PROGRESS, the programme that, by combating social exclusion, sends a message to Europe that we are not merely an economic union, but also spare a thought for, and help, those who have problems to contend with. We have also managed to get more money for Health and Consumer Protection, for cross-frontier cooperation and in many other areas. If you were to ask me whether I would like to see more than what we have achieved, I would tell you, without a doubt, that, yes, I would have liked more, but that I know that there are always two, or sometimes three, sides to a compromise, and that is why we were as tough as possible in negotiating, for we were negotiating with people who drive a hard bargain. The result that emerged is one with which not everyone can be satisfied, and all the things we would have liked, which we described in the Böge report, will be back on the table in the next few years, and these requests will keep coming back to you, whether for own resources for funding agricultural policy or for other areas; we will be asking you how you propose to meet your commitments – by which I mean to GALILEO – and you will then come to us. Let me say in conclusion that this compromise may well not be the stuff of my dreams, but I wholeheartedly endorse it, and ask my fellow Members of this House to approve it.

Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, our discussions on the Financial Perspective are about to take place. You said at the beginning, Chancellor, that you were familiar with annual budgets from working with the national budget in Austria. We have one of those at the European level too. The difference is that we also have to try, within the framework of a voluntary Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council, to lay down common rules for a period of seven years governing both the volume of resources and their use. Since this is a voluntary agreement between two institutions, it is hardly surprising that one of the institutions is not prepared simply to accept the figures adopted at a summit meeting of the other institution on the basis of an assurance that the latter had gone as far as it could and that there was no more to be had. That would be the last straw! Any Parliament that relied on such an assurance would be jeopardising one of its fundamental rights and reneging on its corresponding legal and practical responsibilities. Let us take a close look at your figures. We adopted the budget for 2006 only a few weeks ago. It amounts to 1.09% of GNP. In the Council, you said we should have to make do in future with 1.045%, which is considerably less. At the same time, we have major tasks ahead of us that have to be accomplished. These, however, can either not be adequately funded from a budget of this size, which would mean disappointing people, or else we must think of ways to achieve greater flexibility, so that we can keep our promises. Your pruning strategy gives us decisions to take. In which areas do you actually want to make cuts? In the fight against terrorism? I have heard that Europol is to be reinforced. In the realm of air safety, for which we are setting up an agency? I do not believe we can afford to make any savings in these areas. What about exchanges of school pupils, students and trainees, who travel to other European countries to develop their own skills, work in a European environment and make themselves competitive in years to come? Surely these exchanges are essential! Research, you said, should be a national responsibility. Satellite navigation, large-scale lasers, neutron sources, genome banks: should research in all of these fields be limited to national efforts? I do not think that is the way forward. We have done a great deal of work here to put a good proposal on the table. We shall negotiate responsibly with you, in a spirit of mutual trust, to determine what is possible. As Europeans, however, I believe we, all of us, should consider what this Europe is actually worth to us. Before any figures in billions are bandied about, let me say that I worked this out for the other German Members and myself. Our proposal means that every German would have to spend ten euros a month in future to make all these things happen. Anyone out there who says that we are utterly irrational in the European Parliament or that we are overshooting the mark really has no idea what Europe is worth.

 I am in favour of the Members’ Statute being adopted without delay. All Members of the European Parliament should, as soon as possible, be subject to uniform terms and conditions. I will not, however, be participating in the vote, as I shall not be availing myself of the new arrangements. I took my seat subject to the former conditions and will continue to regard myself as bound by them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is success in the European Union, it is in community, in cooperation, in a common interest in the ongoing development of the kind that is before us. We have to consider how we are going to deal with what we face in the years to come, and the public are watching us closely as we do so. What do our actions do for our credibility? We know that there are tasks awaiting us that will call for courage and a pro-active approach, that will require that we spell out the fact that this European Union is an economic community with an interest in success. While the consequence of this is that we have to invest in the future by stepping up research and improving education and training, we also have to take care that, in this economic community geared to economic success, people and regions are not left behind, and so there is also a need for assistance for those who may, in the course of these changes and developments, have got into difficulties or are already living under problematic circumstances. It is there in this report. It is because the report that Mr Böge has presented specifically aims to set out guidelines for this and to make available the resources that we need that we are prepared to support it, but the public also expect their representatives – for such is what we are – to think not only about how to spend money where necessary, but also about the supply side; in other words, they want to know where the money is going to come from. It is, after all, the public who have to foot the bill for all this. It must therefore be acceptable to ask at European level whether the burden of these tasks is equally shared. It is quite clear that nothing now justifies the British rebate. We all have to go out and show the people of Europe, in all our countries, that we are ready and willing to make the necessary funding available. At the same time, we are ready and able to ensure that the resulting burdens are shared out fairly and in a spirit of solidarity. Solidarity means not just joining together in sharing out resources; it also means making sure that individuals are not overburdened while others stand aside and bid them manage as best they can. We want to ensure together that Europe changes for the better.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am glad to be able to greet you again so soon and to be dealing with you. As many have said, what we are dealing with now is one of the greatest challenges we face, second only to the annual deliberations on the Budget. If one is to accept such a great challenge, one already associated with such bellicose language and accompanied – in that figures have already been produced for our consideration – by the opening of many secondary theatres of war, it is a good thing to keep a cool head and work through things in a systematic fashion. I can assure you that there are many in this House who will approach this matter with a calm mind, rather than allowing themselves to be distracted. Our task is to see to it that this House is sufficiently involved, and we will of course insist on that through the proper channels and press the point if the need to do so arises. My colleagues and I are very grateful to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for having refrained from playing games with numbers and for having adopted a ‘building block’ approach, which focuses attention on matters of substance. You have said that we have to closely examine the individual policy areas in order to see what we can actually do, and what we want for Europe in the future, and the work you are doing reflects that. We will work in parallel with you and make proposals where necessary, hoping that you will take account of them in your calculations during the process rather than only when it is drawing to a close. There will inevitably be many questions in our own minds, those being the questions raised by the European policy of the future, and the public demand answers to them. We will, in future, have new tasks to take upon ourselves, and we will also have to talk about whether the existing policies as set down to date were shaped in the right way. We will not be abandoning principles, and one that we do not believe can be abandoned is that of cohesion in this Europe of ours. It is in areas such as this, for example, that there is discussion as to whether we want to make universal provision – as we have done in the past – or whether we want to promote lighthouses and centres of growth. This we will have to discuss with you, and a discussion of this kind, dealing with details and substance, calls for courage. It will demand courage of the Council, for it is the Council that will have to say when certain things are to be sold to the public as European tasks, one example being the reinforcement of security in the wake of 11 September, and another being cooperation in the foreign policy sphere, for which funding will be needed. We, Members of the European Parliament, will also need the courage to repatriate to the national level certain things that are not best performed at European level. We will have to have a debate about this. I would like to give brief consideration to the issue of duration, which two speakers have already addressed. The fact is that the seven years we are talking about – a period running until 2013 – amounts to nine years from today. Just bear in mind that it is for a period of nine years that we will be making estimates; nine years ago, Michael Jackson’s Earth Song
 was number one in the hit parades, the word ‘euro’ had only just been invented, and it was nine years ago that Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the European Union. That was nine years ago! As we now have to talk in terms of that sort of period running into the future, I do think we have to watch out. We should in fact be putting this duration back under the microscope. Four years or three years would be something else. It was four years ago that we adopted the Treaty of Nice. That is a manageable period of time, so let us talk about the periods for which the Financial Perspective might run. Let us also, though, discuss the issue of flexibility, which we need. The European Union’s development is not linear; we need change. Over past months, we have had, again and again, to make use of the flexibility instrument. You know every bit as well as we do that discussion of that is on the agenda. I also want to address the issue of the revenue side, for an MEP cannot be happy to be always given the task of maximising expenditure, that being assumed to be the only thing we are interested in. Such is not the case! If we are to talk in terms of net contributors and net burdens, we want to know whether the engines pulling us are capable of having more wagons attached to them until they are incapable of moving, or how we can raise the money. So something else we want to discuss with you is the mechanisms that the revenue side requires, and what I would like you to tell us is whether you are willing to have us involved over and above the extent specified in the Treaty, whether you are willing to talk to us and take us seriously where expenditure and revenue are concerned, or whether that is where you want us to be completely detached. If you want results, I can do no other than urge you to cooperate with us. We will have to fight it out among ourselves at various points along the way, but I do believe that results are achieved when self-confident people deal with one another, each of them knowing what he is capable of and what is expected of him.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my high regard for the work done by the outgoing Commissioner. Over the past five years, I have been able, as spokesman of my group, to work closely with her, and I can say that I have the greatest respect for her and for the work she has done, for hers is not an easy portfolio, and she has not always had the steady support of those around her; on the contrary, she has often had to make a very great effort, and that is why we respect her so highly. Let me also pay tribute to my two fellow-Members who are now this House’s rapporteurs – Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo, and Mrs Anne Jensen in particular, who took over the work of rapporteur only a month ago. Making such a good job of it without preparation is remarkable in itself, and so every respect to her. The Budget before us is not some sort of abstract entity with nothing but figures floating around in it; on the contrary, it reflects the sort of policies we want to make and on which we have decided; it reflects how we want the European Union to further develop, and what we want it to be like. At the same time, we must always bear in mind that it is the taxpayer’s money that we are spending, and we are obliged to be very careful in what we do with it. It can, I think, be said that this House has, over recent years, been a very careful steward of the European taxpayers’ resources. If the impression is communicated every year during the Budget debate that Parliament wants more to be spent while the Council, representing the governments, always wants to cut outgoings, that amounts only to fake frugality on the part of the Council. This, I believe, is where we have to ensure that the funds we need to make the policies that we want to happen are actually available. Let me clarify that by using two or three examples. Over past years, we have again and again seen the categories narrowed down. It has just been said that Category 4 has become more and more restrictive. Commissioner Schreyer rightly pointed out that Category 4 used to include not only foreign policy, but also Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans as well. All these things were to be paid for using the same funds. The Council wanted more to be spent on its common foreign and security policy, but the things we wanted, it cut – such things, for example, as funds that would have been made available for democratisation or for conflict prevention. That is just not on! You cannot fund what you are promising for the future with money for promises made in the past; it merely baffles the public, who no longer have any clear idea of what the European Union actually stands for. This we will not go along with, and we will keep on telling uncomfortable truths. In the other field, that of internal policy, which has also just been mentioned, we have created several extra agencies. These agencies exist to perform administrative tasks, but they are introduced into a portfolio with which we want to make internal policies, environmental policy, policies on research, development, and education. All these things are crammed in on top. Additional tasks are transferred and the whole thing is rubber-stamped by the Council, which then comes to us and tells us that we must be more careful with money! We will tighten our belts, even in this Budget procedure. We will look to see exactly what we need. In this Budget procedure, then, we will take up our positions, exert our influence successfully, and make it clear to the public that what we have announced in the past we will stick to and make happen. There will be no blank cheques handed out, neither in the 2005 Budget procedure, nor when it comes to the future funding of the European Union. You can expect this House to stand firm; we will tell people what is needed and also where we can make savings. (Muted applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, the displacement of freight from road to rail and internal waterways or short sea shipping is a slow burner in our transport debates and has been for decades. Now, in the context of the climate debate, this debate has naturally taken on new importance. In the meantime, we have arrived at this shift via various political approaches and instruments. However, if we look at it carefully, traffic is very difficult to shift in practice and this is only achieved in very rare cases. Firstly, because connections between the modes of transport are still not sufficiently harmonised; secondly, because rail and inland waterways are still not sufficiently established as European service providers, and thirdly, because the environmentally-friendly forms of transport obviously cannot essentially provide a door-to-door service. All these difficulties are being further exacerbated in the present recession by plummeting prices in road freight transport. Marco Polo II has also felt the impact of all these problems. That is why we transport politicians are urgently interested in a solution, because our stated target, namely that Marco Polo should help to displace 60% of the increase in road freight traffic, is now a long way away. We therefore need to switch direction before the end of this parliamentary term and we have therefore found a most reasonable compromise. What is to happen? Firstly, the Commission instructed an agency to take over the administration of the programme and to simplify the administration procedure even before this regulation was proposed. That makes sense. We have found and jointly negotiated a whole series of points in the compromise in order to make the programme more attractive. Firstly, the threshold for Motorways of the Sea has been reduced from 250 to 200 million tonne-kilometres a year; secondly, the threshold for traffic displacement projects has been reduced from 80 to 60 million tonne-kilometres, as has the threshold for inland waterway projects, where Parliament pushed through a reduction from 17 to 13 million tonne-kilometres. We have also increased the permissible funding level for additional infrastructures from 10% to 20%. That makes sense. Finally, we also successfully argued that economic crises such as we are experiencing now can also be cited as grounds for extending the term of contracts. So we have made the programme considerably more attractive. This compromise which we reached was also made possible by a high degree of consensus between all parliamentarians, who put aside justifiable considerations and fundamental debate at this point, in order to quickly get the programme started again. That is why, before the Commission tables a Marco Polo III proposal, we really need a general debate so that we can reintroduce all these points which are necessary to our future orientation. Moreover, we naturally want to know how the adjustment we have made now will work out. This is the subject of the vote and I hope I shall have your support tomorrow.

Madam President, Commissioner, I agree with you. We can send out a positive message tomorrow, namely that we are able to make citizen-friendly and sensible amendments to our legislation when it is necessary to do so. We should not only send out this message; we should also start up an information campaign in the countries of Europe, so that we can capitalise on the attractiveness of this programme, because we really have made all the necessary adjustments. Now there are real deals to be had at bargain prices. If we cannot manage to shift anything now, then we really do need to question the entire programme. I hope, Mrs Jensen, that we shall not have to put the money into other programmes, because this is an important concern. We must and will displace traffic wherever possible, but it is difficult. Mr Blokland, you have already had an answer. We re-negotiated inland waterway transport and forced an additional compromise on the Council, as it were. Our concern was to finish at first reading. That is why we could not take too radical an approach and had to negotiate with one eye on compromise and consensus. As a result, we achieved a great deal. I look forward to the fundamental debate which we shall have shortly on the third programme, on the basis of a communication which the Commission has promised, so that we can discuss all the fundamental questions, everything that we have listed in a joint motion for a compromise, such as whether we should split up the programme for individual modes of transport and so on. Then it will become exciting again. Now it just has to work, so that it does not grind to a halt and projects already under way possibly fall by the way-side in this crisis. That really would be a pity, hence this compromise. My thanks once again to everyone for their input.

Madam 
President, in competition with road freight traffic, freight traffic on the railways only stands a chance if it really is established throughout Europe, which is why I welcome the introduction of cross-border freight traffic corridors, on which freight traffic will be optimised. That is what it is about. With this report, we have defused justified concerns about a reduction in the standard of passenger traffic with fixed priority regulations for freight traffic. However, we shall have to do more work on the report, because we are process workers and we are only at first reading. In future we shall have to also take account of how the Member States react. We need a different basis on which to calculate the number of corridors. Parliament has proposed one per country. I think that we in Germany would need a north/south and an east/west corridor. Secondly, we need to consider if alternate corridors are possible in areas which possibly have less mixed traffic. Thirdly, it must be clear that the overall capacity of rail transport must not be reduced. Last but not least, many citizens worry that more freight traffic on the railways will bring more noise with it. That is why we must start with sensible legislation on noise reduction in freight rail traffic straight away in the next parliamentary term. I look forward to more work. We still have things to do. My thanks to the rapporteur, because this really was a good compromise on a very contentious issue.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I know of a song which contains the line ‘There must be unlimited freedom in the sky’. This is simply not true. The European sky consists of a patchwork of 60 national control centres. This is twice as many as in the USA, but with half the amount of air traffic. In addition, military no-fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another. This is not sustainable, particularly in the light of the fact that the volume of air traffic doubles every 10 to 15 years. When the amount of traffic doubles, the safety risk increases fourfold. This led us in 2004 to initiate the single European sky concept. Unfortunately the Council of Ministers insisted at the time that Member States should agree among themselves which airspace blocks should be created. This was a mistake, because the Member States have now wasted a great deal of time and become bogged down in issues of national competence. Now the Parliament and a good rapporteur have put in place a regulation with clear objectives and ground rules for the introduction of these airspace blocks by 2012. This makes a contribution to safety, to climate protection and to reducing the costs of air traffic. Flights which are 50 kilometres shorter, a 12% cut in CO2
 emissions, savings of EUR 3 billion for the airlines and fewer delays for passengers. In brief, I hope that this sectoral reform in the sky will finally be successful and will take us a step further.

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank Mr El Khadraoui. He has achieved a workable compromise under really difficult conditions. For us transport policy makers, it is a quantum leap forward that air pollution, noise and congestion can now also be included in the tolls. This reinforces the polluter pays principle. The polluter pays principle prevents profits going into private hands while the damage is paid for by society. That is a social democratic concept. Parliament has resolved to introduce this principle to all modes of transport step by step. There will then, at long last, be fair competition between the railways, lorries and inland waterways. It must also be made clear at this point that it will be entirely up to the Member States whether or not these additional tolls are implemented. Nobody will be forced to do so. All we are doing here is setting up the basic framework for it so that there is no patchwork of different toll models across Europe, thereby avoiding discrimination, as road haulage should be treated in a comparable way throughout the internal market. For us, this is not about additional income streams but is, instead, about directing transport more strongly by means of price signals. The Committee on Transport and Tourism is right to want to see the mandatory ring-fencing of this additional income for use in reducing external damage. However, there is still one fly in the ointment, as I see it. Unfortunately, the committee decision, as it currently stands, links the introduction of congestion costs for goods vehicles to the inclusion of other modes of transport, such as passenger cars. That will prevent the introduction of congestion costs in those Member States, such as Germany, that do not want a toll for passenger cars. That therefore denies us an important instrument of taxation in the field of transport policy. My conclusion is as follows: tomorrow’s vote offers a breakthrough in transport policy after decades of discussion about external costs. I hope that we will receive the necessary majority to achieve that breakthrough.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this very moving issue, we now move on to more technical matters. We want to pass the directive on airport charges at second reading tomorrow and, after the clear vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am certain that we shall be able to do so. What is this directive about? It introduces uniform principles and procedures throughout Europe for levying airport charges. This means that transparent bases for calculation, non-discrimination against airlines and a set consultation procedure are some of the factors used to establish fair airport charges. An independent supervisory authority can resolve conflicts which arise on the basis of clear rules. This will strengthen the systemic partnership between airports and airlines and prevent any possible abuse of market power. What was the starting point? Over the past 15 years we have made two attempts to reconcile the conflicting interests of airports and airlines in this area. One of the reasons they failed was because we have totally different procedures and structures in the Member States. In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a strict regulatory authority which can set ceilings, in five Member States we have airport networks and the practice of cross-subsidy, we have parliaments which decide on airport charges, decentralised competences in Germany and much more besides. Nonetheless, we have managed to negotiate a sustainable compromise with the Council. What now are the components of this compromise? We have set the scope at airports with over five million passengers a year, plus the largest airports of a Member State. At present that means that the directive applies to 69 airports in the European Union. We have introduced a compulsory procedure for regular consultation between airports and airlines and, at the same time, we have laid down a structured arbitration procedure with deadlines and, of course, set up the supervisory authority I referred to. What do we now mean by fair charges? Airport charges should have a stronger cost reference in future, must be substantiated by transparent calculations and must refer to the agreed level of service. At the same time, there is a strict ban on discrimination. What this means in principle is that we have the same charges for the same services for every airline at the same airport, with the possibility of differentiation. What pleases me is that we have allowed this, first and foremost, for noise and pollution. Some countries will continue to have common charging systems for the aforementioned airport networks and for what are referred to as airport systems in towns and conurbations, but these too must meet the transparency requirements of the directive. We have tried, by providing for pre-financing of infrastructure through charges, to respond to certain concerns of our colleagues from the eastern European Member States. This will be possible, even if difficult on the basis of national criteria, provided that ICAO standards are met. What do we expect from the effects? More competition between the European airports, more competition between the various airlines at an airport, perhaps gradually falling ticket prices if the airlines pass the lower charges on to passengers. The directive has to be implemented in two years’ time. My thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for our successful negotiations and to the Slovenian President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission.

 Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the controversial problem of the definition of parent companies. The purpose of the definition is indeed to prevent airlines with shares in a CRS abusing their position. At present this palpably concerns Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa, which have a minority holding in Amadeus. The current practice of the Commission examining this on a case-by-case basis when abuse is suspected has been proven. Cases of the abuse of influence have been resolved and prosecuted. To date this has occurred on two occasions. There are no reasonable grounds for changing anything in this essentially proven practice. The definition found of a parent enterprise based on the expression, with regard to competition law, of the determining influence complies with this proven practice. The term has been proving itself for 40 years now. Some Members, however, want every airline with a capital share to be automatically defined as a parent company. For the air transport market this means massive and unnecessary interference in the current competitive situation. Nor would consumers obtain any advantage from this. The four winners would be, for example, British Airways, American Airlines and others that would benefit from such a shift in the competitive situation. In addition, the only European computerised reservation system would have to accept a competitive disadvantage with regard to US competitors on the hotly contested European market. This I consider politically unreasonable, even negligent, and I therefore recommend that the compromise found be accepted.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank Mr Degutis for his good work and, of course, for the good cooperation. We are at last adopting the necessary update to the third liberalisation package. This recast text injects new clarity and efficiency, especially in regard to authorisation for placing in service, aircraft leasing, traffic distribution and air service safety. It also makes it clear that EU and national social legislation must be applied properly, regardless of the Member State in which the airline has its operational base. Nevertheless, the social and working conditions in European aviation remain a problem and need to be put back on the agenda. The text could not resolve the question of the insurance model in the event of airline bankruptcy either, because of its complexity. That is another task for the Commission. The adoption of rules on price transparency is a great success. In future, it will no longer be possible to con European citizens with tempting offers. All customers will now be able to see not just the final price but also the proportion of the cost that goes to the airline, airport and state. That is a major contribution to consumer protection. Once again, I thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation.

Madam President, Commissioner, if there is any chance of a risk to human life, we have to take rapid and preventive political action. There is no other option. Obviously that also applies to children under the age of two in aeroplanes. First, I want to thank Mrs Lichtenberger warmly for giving us access to the video showing crash tests of loop belts. I also want to thank the Commissioner for delivering an opinion that is very much in line with our question, although a few points remain to be clarified. These new requirements for the transportation by aeroplane of small children will be entering into force at the end of next week. Member States will then have the choice between child seats and loop belts. As we have seen, however, loop belts can be life-threatening. My first question is: when at the latest will the Commission present a proposal making it mandatory always to use child seats in aeroplanes? That follows the same line as Mr Jarzembowski’s question. My next question is: what is the Commission’s current implementing strategy? Will it present a regulation or how does it intend to implement whatever findings the survey may produce? Thirdly, if we continue to allow parts of the necessary EU OPS regulation to be adopted under the new comitology procedure, how can we be sure we can still get and consider a regulation on safe child seats during this legislative term?

Mr President, I wish to drop a few more flies into the ointment. After the major crisis we now have a good and balanced proposal for a regulation, which in my view will secure the construction phase. To do this, however, we should not run over the agenda. The project has been put back five years, with the operating phase planned to begin in 2013. Our industrial policy strategy is therefore failing, as regards being ahead of GPS 3 on the market with Galileo and setting the standards worldwide. I therefore believe that we still need a detailed analysis of the crisis the Commission itself has created, because we have to learn from the breakdown of the PPP model, since another PPP model is available with Caesar. We now no longer have any competitive edge with Galileo, so marketing the system is clearly becoming more difficult. For this reason we must have a discussion in sufficient time about the public costs of the operating phase after 2013 and we should concentrate on how we can establish publicly funded systems for Galileo such as tolls, eCall and Caesar. Finally, we are now already in need of a programme for the combined use of Galileo and GPS signals. We have to concentrate on this because therein lies the added value.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course it is always better when the Commissioner is present, as there are some critical points that I would like to put to him directly, but I will have to do this at a later time. For more than 15 years we have been trying, or rather the Commission has been trying, to lay down a regulatory framework in the form of an EU directive on airport charges. Two attempts have already failed because of the conflict of interest between the airports and the airlines and between the different Member States. On this occasion, too, there was a great deal of conflict and I cannot recall a single one of the 189 amendments in committee that was generally accepted by all the parties involved. Many airlines want to see as much cost transparency as possible from the other side, the airports, and a regulatory authority that would ultimately set the prices, along with the introduction of the ‘single till’ system. Many airports would prefer no change whatsoever to the status quo. Moreover, the negotiations were also hampered by the structural particularities that exist in various Member States. The United Kingdom, for example, already has a rigorous regulatory authority, the CAA, while at the same time most of the airports want to be deregulated and indeed the trend is in that direction. In Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Finland and Spain many of the airports are operated in a system of airport networks with standard airport charges, which means cross-subsidisation and often results in little transparency. In Spain airport charges are even laid down by Parliament, in other words the Members of Parliament decide on the levels that will apply. In Germany this area has been controlled at federal level and not by a national authority, while in the new Member States airport charges are needed to a large extent to develop the airport infrastructure. I mention all these different interests if only to demonstrate how complicated these negotiations have been. What we have achieved to date has therefore been primarily directed at settling these conflicts of interest, for we in the committee are of the opinion that such a regulation is needed and that every effort should be made to agree on one. So what has been achieved so far towards settling these differences? We have reduced the field of application to airports with either five million passenger journeys or more a year or 15% of the national passenger throughput in the Member State concerned, for in the case of regional airports with less than five million passengers a year the risk of an abuse of market power is either small or absent. Secondly, we have stipulated that airports will be free to choose their preferred business model, and thirdly, we have included airport networks generally within the scope of the directive. Fourthly, we have firmed up the role of the regulatory authorities and allowed them to delegate all or part of the provisions to regional regulatory bodies. Fifthly, we have introduced stricter requirements for the intervention of the regulatory authority and, sixthly, we have again allowed airport managing bodies to pre-finance infrastructure projects via their airport charges, as had been possible in the past, though subject to certain conditions. We want to see differentiation of charges based on objective criteria and according to the level of services provided and the environmental performance, and we want to see a system for defining and concluding an overall service level agreement. The compromises that have been negotiated were adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism with only one dissenting vote. That is a real achievement, considering the starting position, and on this point I would like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for their close and constructive collaboration. We now have to lay down standardised principles of transparency, non-discrimination and regulated consultation and notification when setting airport charges in Europe. This will help reduce future distortions of competition and make it more difficult for those who might seek to abuse their market power. The directive will, in my opinion, make a significant contribution towards stabilising the inherent partnership that exists between airports and airlines and at the same time will strengthen Europe’s position as an air transport hub. I therefore call on Members to support the Committee on Transport and Tourism in tomorrow’s vote on the directive at first reading.

Finally, I have one more question: what is your position on the differentiation of charges according to environmental criteria? These are the questions that I would still like to see answered.

We still have a certain distance to go together and there will be some hard bargaining when the Council presents its common position. In recent weeks it has become apparent that the Council is coming over to our way of thinking on several points, including the scope of the directive, the subject of airport networks and the rejection of ‘opt-outs’ by national states. However, there are also some new points that have not yet even been discussed, such as setting national upper limits on charges. There therefore needs to be further internal discussion on these matters. It will first of all be important to reach as much common agreement as possible on these points tomorrow so that we have a strong negotiating mandate when presented with the Council’s position. I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the detailed position that you have presented. I would just like to conclude by explaining why infrastructure pre-financing is so important for this Parliament: for one thing, it is possible under the ICAO; secondly, we naturally do not want to see a sudden escalation of charges when the new infrastructure comes on the market; and finally, of course, there is a large backlog demand, not just in Eastern Europe but in other new Member States too. However, I know that this is a contentious issue and we will have to wait and see what progress can be made here. Thank you again and I look forward to further discussions with you and with my fellow Members here. May I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation. (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion is the exact opposite to that of Mr Bradbourn, but, before I proceed, may I add my thanks to Mr Leichtfried for the report and, of course, for the skilfully negotiated compromise. Extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is a step towards guaranteeing the highest possible standards of aviation safety, uniform pilots’ licences with equivalent training standards, licensing of airlines from countries outside the European Economic Area and uniform training of cabin crew as well as responsibility for the implementation of EU-OPS. By enabling EASA to impose fines for non-compliance with safety regulations, I believe we are considerably enhancing its enforcement powers. This, I hope, will soon put a stop to the sometimes unnecessary and unproductive rivalries and power struggles between the national authorities and EASA. The rapid growth of aviation in Europe makes it essential that EASA should be a strong body with centralised responsibility for overseeing technical safety. In my view, this also means that the funding of EASA must be put on a stable long-term basis. I believe that one of the next steps will be to ensure not only that the work of the national air accident investigation authorities in Europe is coordinated but also that their findings are analysed by EASA. That will enhance safety in Europe and prevent whitewashing by the affected Member States. In the long term, and I emphasise the long term, we need a model in Europe that will not only make the national tier superfluous but will also deal jointly with matters relating to safety and accident prevention, as the Federal Aviation Administration does in the United States. That is my vision.

Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Commissioner for his remarks. As you know, Commissioner, we have been having this discussion about the assessment of external costs since the 1920s, and we Members also proposed various models when we were adopting the Eurovignette Directive. However, since we did not succeed at that time, for political reasons, in incorporating external costs to any great degree into the method used to calculate the road tolls for heavy goods vehicles, we reached an agreement that you – the Commission – would present a uniform method by the summer of 2008. That agreement assumes particular importance in the light of the present discussion on climate change. This being the case, we now have questions to ask. Some of them have already been aired. Firstly, will the Commission present a universally applicable and transparent model for the assessment of all external costs by June of next year, a model that may be regarded as universally binding? When I hear of a handbook, it sounds good, but the term tends to suggest a pick-and-mix catalogue of good practices. What we want, however, is a universally binding method that will not subsequently be called into question. Secondly, will this model take account of the climatic and environmental objectives set by the EU? That is what my honourable colleague Mrs Ţicău asked. In terms of method, that would no easy matter, because all the existing approaches focus purely on the inclusion of current costs and not on the achievement of environmental goals. If the pursuit of these goals were factored in, it would create a prescriptive element – a normative dimension, as it were – whereas the debate has so far been confined to current costs. Thirdly, it goes without saying that we want a legislative proposal at the end of the day. May I therefore ask when the Commission intends to revise the Eurovignette Directive? Is that its intention, or is this still entirely up in the air? Fourthly, when will this method or model start to apply to the assessment of infrastructure charges for other modes of transport too? That precise question has been exercising us, as Georg Jarzembowski said. We want to get rid of the distorted competition between modes of transport and raise them all to a common comparable level.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapidly growing aviation sector must be integrated into the emissions trading scheme as quickly as possible. That will mean that this form of transport also starts making a contribution to the reduction of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. From the point of view of transport policy, our legislative task now is to refine the framework conditions. These framework conditions must be defined in such a way that the possible impetus for savings is provided via an appropriate price per tonne of CO2
, without drastically limiting the number of flights. To achieve this, when the airlines are first issued with allowances, for example, this must be done in such a way that the lack of such allowances can be realistically balanced out on the market, otherwise flights would have to be cancelled, and I do not know how much of that we and our society could cope with. Even if airlines were issued with 100% allowances upon entering the scheme – and none of us is asking for that – an annual growth in aviation of 5% would require an equally high volume of savings in terms of CO2
 emissions. That is no small challenge. The greatest potential for reduction is in the realisation of the Single European Sky, which means that it depends on the political will of the Member States. The airlines’ only option for the time being, therefore, is to update their fleets, if there is sufficient capital left over for this purpose after the planned auction sums are taken into account. That will hardly be the case for regional airlines.

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his clear depiction of the situation and the position taken. First, the positives, which have also been mentioned by the previous speaker. With the open skies agreement between the US and Europe, we now finally have the opportunity to establish airline routes from the European Union via the United States to third countries such as Mexico and South America. It also offers the opportunity for any carrier based in the European Union to fly from anywhere in the EU to anywhere in the US without any restrictions on capacity or prices, and I agree with the previous speaker: these opportunities must be utilised. In the area of investment in US airline companies, too, progress has been achieved with this agreement. The Open Skies Agreement thus takes the first important step towards an Open Aviation Area without any restrictions on either side. It can thus create useful new air routes and a large number of new jobs. On the other hand – as has already been said – it must be made clear that this is only the first step and cannot be regarded as a final agreement. We expect the Commission, in a second stage, to negotiate unresolved issues such as cabotage, right of establishment, ownership and State aid with the US. The potential for conflict has already been made very clear by the Commissioner, but I hope that the work in the transatlantic committee will make progress so that we ultimately have reciprocal rights which can be implemented and an Open Skies Agreement which is worthy of the name. In parallel to this, the committee should push for the inclusion of flights from the US in emissions trading, for we know that we did not achieve very much at the ICAO meeting, as you have mentioned. Of course, it should also give emphasis to our demand for one-stop security.

Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for your speech and for the Green Paper, the details of which we are still not familiar with. It is true that more and more people are living in cities and conurbations, but there are also, of course, specific problems associated with shrinking cities, which should not be completely disregarded. My first question is: are they also in our field of vision? We have capacity overload in the inner cities, primarily associated with individual private transport resulting in very high emissions, particulates, noise and also safety problems. Secondly, if we now want to increase public transport, and networking it intelligently plays a crucial role in the solution, the question then arises, of course, whether we will be able to use capital from the Structural Funds for this purpose at all. Thirdly, as regards the many individual proposals for freight transport logistics and so on: do we also have a forum for exchanging best practice models, in which this exchange can take place in an organised manner?
 Ulrich Stockmann  (PSE

 Madam President, Commissioner, we regard the Single European Sky as the most important project for the future of air transport. The Commission always emphasised its importance under your predecessor and I also believe it to be the case. We adopted the 2004 package of regulations. We still have a kind of patchwork in the sky, with 58 national airspace blocks, even though we know we would really only need one, or to be generous perhaps three to six. We know that this patchwork – the figures were given earlier – has adverse effects on safety, and of course also on the economy and consumers. We know about the stacking and congestion in the skies and nowadays we are putting far more emphasis on emissions. We have realised that we can take a big step forward here. In its progress report, the Commission showed how slowly the Member States are moving, even if there are some initiatives, and proposed a few ways of exerting pressure. Now I am not saying that is meaningless, nor ‘I told you so’, but as early as 2003 we said the bottom-up approach would not work, because even at that time we suspected that Member States would get embroiled in discussions about areas of sovereignty in regard to service provision and that such crucial matters need to be regulated by top-down legislative rules. At the time we thought perhaps Eurocontrol could propose rules and make a proposal based simply on the substance, on functionality, which the Member States could then quarrel about, rather than waiting until they themselves had created another kind of patchwork, in a bottom-up approach. What is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework. That would be the only way to exert real pressure and bring about the necessary changes.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Commission proposal and also, of course, the rapporteur’s report, as both make a contribution to the completion of the European internal market for air transport and to increasing safety levels. I should like to mention and highlight four points. Firstly, the provision on price transparency that has been adopted is a clear victory for consumers. It will no longer be possible in future to lure citizens with false bait advertising. Irrespective of the sales channel, all air fares are to be set out comprehensively and in detail. Naturally, air traffic control prices are estimated on a flat-rate basis – although, at the end of the day, prices must be comprehensible. We do not need to argue about this, however. On the whole, we are creating clarity for passengers and strengthening competition. Secondly, with regard to wet-leasing contracts, this is a balanced Regulation that, on the one hand, takes account of airlines’ needs in the event that seasonal pricing movements occur or an exceptional need arises and they have to rely on such a model; and, on the other, makes clear that the circumvention of European safety and social standards is unacceptable. Thirdly, like many reports on aviation legislation, our report contains numerous amendments on social legislation for employees. The Commission is urgently required to make a proposal on this at long last, to close the loophole that the Services Directive has left and the present Regulation cannot close. Fourthly, the new one-step procedure for traffic distribution is simpler and quicker than all previous procedures. This is a good decision, including in terms of the future, that enables a more flexible response to capacity bottlenecks in infrastructure.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the revised version of Regulation 2320/2002 is good and should be applied as quickly as possible. First of all, let me make two points about the sunset clause. We are confronted here with a dilemma. No politician, and indeed no civil servant, will take responsibility for rolling back inefficient security structures. Accordingly, the burden of proof must lie with those who seek to extend an implementing regulation and not with those who want to let it expire. That is the main argument. Secondly, there is sometimes a need to respond very quickly, as you did in the case of the liquids, but the fact is that the risk assessment and cost analysis must follow, so that the process takes its right and proper course. The sunset clause is also a good means to this end. Now to the main issue, the dispute about funding. We should refocus on the problem that exercised us at the beginning, namely how we can eliminate distortions of competition and obtain transparent and, as far as possible, uniform funding models in Europe. The Commission must intervene here in a mediating role. We should not focus so sharply on the question whether taxpayers or passengers should foot the bill. That discussion, I believe, has become unproductive and no longer addresses the real issue. We need proposals on ways to achieve transparent funding models in Europe that are as uniform as possible.

 Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council should, in my view, observe the following guidelines in its current negotiations with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data. Firstly, it is through a proportionate approach that an appropriate level of security will be achieved, and that approach is not apparent in the case of the current agreements. Such an approach depends – and this is my second point – on implementing compliance with normal European data protection standards, and that in my view involves changing the status quo, mainly through reducing the quantity of behaviour-related data. Where switching over to the push system is concerned, Austrian Airlines has, to my knowledge, operated this system from the beginning - successfully, too. The system involves having a clearly defined framework for using the data, a limit on the period for which the data is stored and, not least, the ability to lodge a complaint in the event of data being misused. Mr Gloser, you rightly said that we need legal certainty as quickly as possible for European airlines. As a politician involved in transport issues, I can only concur with that. Given that the transfer of data really is about making progress in combating terrorism, it has an international dimension, and we no doubt also need international agreements with internationally binding data protection rules. These are what we should be negotiating towards. We must always be concerned to uphold our right to freedom of movement, which can only be achieved in an open society in which people can move about freely without falling under general suspicion. It would be unacceptable to us as Members of the European Parliament if the principle of equality were to be violated and if different levels of data protection were to apply to US citizens, on the one hand, and to non-Americans, on the other. I have confidence in the determination of the German Presidency of the Council as it conducts the negotiations. I know that these will not be a simple matter.

 Mr President, inaccuracies in the German translation of our compromise proposal on cabin crew have caused confusion among some of my fellow Members. These inaccuracies are found in Amendments 20, 22 and 24(1). The authoritative version is the English ‘where relevant’, which translates into German as ‘wo angebracht
’ and not ‘wenn angebracht’
, which would be ‘if relevant’.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reference has already been made to the Naiades action programme, and that which we have not yet negotiated today will at last accord inland waterways the attention and support on the part of the European legislator that are rightfully due to them. Today, of course, we are taking a less spectacular decision, but one that is nevertheless long overdue, in that this House, at second reading, will be agreeing to the harmonisation of technical regulations for inland vessels, thus bringing to an end a legislative process that has been going on for nine years now. This directive adapts Community standards to the more extensive ones contained in the Convention on the Navigation of the Rhine, and this, as we see it, guarantees free competition on all internal waterways with the same high safety standards applying in every instance. At first reading, and in the Common Position, this House and the Council made various amendments. Like the rapporteur, to whom I am most grateful for her report, I, too, take the view that these amendments are generally acceptable and add to the original Commission proposal in a reasonable way. We endorse the view expressed by Mr Grosch and Mrs Wortmann-Kool in their amendment on the subject, that certain types of vessel are subject to two sets of legislation, and, even though we have now been advised that the two sets of legislation are quite different, we do nevertheless think that the amendment is sound, and what we would welcome at the earliest possible opportunity is the revision of the technical annexes of the relevant directives in order to remove the duplication. Apart from that, what both my group and I want is for the legislation to be completed without delay.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Sommer has already, today, quoted the German saying according to which a happy outcome is worth waiting for, and I believe that might be the case when it comes to this legislation on EU-OPS. I do not want to spend a great deal of time reviewing the lengthy process whereby we worked out what we want, which involved us in two first readings and various proposals from the Commission over a period of six years. It has become clear to me that we MEPs are production line workers, and certainly many people have been working on this one. I would like, once more, to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the good work that Mr Simpson did during the previous Parliament, and, in particular, for the constructive cooperation with all Members during this one. I am also appreciative of the good work the Commission has done as a mediator, particularly that done by Mr Salvarani – since both he and I are being kept from watching the football today, I am grateful to him for being here – and not least for the Council’s willingness to compromise. The negotiations have produced a respectable result and one that adds value to Europe. Following the liberalisation of the European air transport sector and the great enlargement of 2004, we have now at last succeeded in harmonising all those technical standards and administrative regulations that have a bearing on the safety of civil aviation, and now it is high time we took the continuing expansion of air travel into account. The laying down of safety standards – ranging from construction to the rules on the transport of hazardous goods, by way of regulations on instruments – takes up nearly 500 pages. Until very recently, there was controversy about sections O and Q, which deal with the training of cabin crew and the working hours, in-flight hours and rest periods of pilots, and that is not surprising, since this is where the safety issues also touch upon the social benefits of the persons concerned. I do nevertheless think that we have succeeded, here too, in defining a provisional platform that, for many countries, amounts to a marked improvement in safety standards. Before second reading, the Committee on Transport and Tourism made some important changes. Firstly, we wanted to add a safeguard clause to prevent the situation arising in which, in countries with higher standards in law or in collective wage agreements, there would be an inevitable reduction in these standards with consequences for safety and for the social benefits of the personnel on board, and we succeeded in doing that. Secondly, it became apparent from hearings and from numerous studies that cumulative fatigue in pilots as a result of inappropriate scheduling was a problem in need of further investigation even after the result we have achieved, and the Council has proposed that this problem be put back on the agenda in three years’ time. We in this House do not think this is enough, and we have been able to secure a new scientific/medical study after only two years, relating to both sections, including Section O. Thirdly, the cabin crew were, right up to the last minute, raising with us their concerns about the upgrading of their status, and I believe that our amendments do justice to that insofar as it has a bearing on safety. In negotiations with the Council, we have managed to secure an undertaking that further harmonisation and better quality training will remain under consideration and that there will be a study into these issues too. I too take the view that the safeguard clause is applicable to the very varied approaches taken in Europe to certification and the issue of licences, so any loss of status in individual countries is not to be attributed to our legislation. Fourthly, when we started work on EU-OPS, no account was taken of the special situation of express freight services at night, and on that, too, we and the interested parties have arrived at a compromise that makes proper provision for their specific flight schedules while not compromising safety standards. Let me sum up by saying, once again, that a happy outcome is worth waiting for; whether it actually will be a happy one is something that will emerge from further work on the transposition of this directive. I ask all the groups in this House to give their support to this compromise that we have reached with the Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we need is a standardised European procedure for stemming the environmental impact of air transport. Unilateral measures at national level such as airline-ticket taxes and kerosene taxes will not work. Emissions trading in air transport is the right course of action but, from a transport-policy point of view – or from my point of view – the main instruments contained in the Lucas report are wrong. Firstly, we need aviation to be included in the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme. A separate scheme would be counterproductive and would stall the growth in air transport. That conflicts with our Lisbon Strategy. Why is that the case? There is no market without suppliers and, in the early days, air transport will buy only on the basis of its growth rates and of technical innovations for the long term. In addition, a separate scheme would require a new administrative structure and contradict our intention to strive for better lawmaking. What would we then do with other modes of transport? Would we need further schemes? This does not make any sense. Secondly, I reject the inclusion of non-CO2 climate-change impacts through multipliers. Let us look at Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, where the NOx problem is regulated by means of landing charges. It makes sense to do it that way.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur for his considerable expertise and cooperative approach to the job. Since he has set out in detail what Marco Polo is all about and has also evaluated it, I propose to focus on just a few aspects of it. What is to be seen in a positive light is that the programme is markedly better funded and equipped than its predecessors, ranging from PACT 1 to Marco Polo 1, but it has to be said that its funding and equipment are not going to be equal to the challenge of modal shift, and that is why we need, first of all, to be vigilant in ensuring that the projects are, firstly, genuinely cross-border in nature, so as to ensure an added value for Europe, and, secondly, in ensuring that the reduction by half of the minimum threshold values for grants really does put SMEs in a stronger position and increase their share. Thirdly, more inland waterway transport projects must be completed than have been in the past, and, fourthly, those national programmes that are either already in place or needed for the future must, at long last, be coordinated. Fifthly, attention should be paid to reviewing the instruments’ sustainability, which will involve the Commission in evaluating which projects are still operational after a period of between six and ten years, with the Commission – sixthly – reviewing which of the rejected projects are completed even without support, so that the induced effects of future programmes may be minimised. Mr Rack's report is, overall, uncontentious, and should be implemented as policy with the greatest possible speed; the added value of these measures will be immediately visible to the public, and that is something for which time is needed.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that Europe and its citizens stand to gain from eCall. While it is primarily intended to prevent deaths and reduce human suffering, its economic benefits and the increased efficiency of road infrastructure should not be overlooked. It brings Europe added value in the field of road traffic safety, which, despite the single European internal market in transport, is still primarily – perhaps Mr Jarzembowski would like to take note of this – a matter for the Member States’ jurisdiction. That is why this good own-initiative report of Mr Titley’s is aimed at calling on the Member States, firstly to sign the declaration of intent with respect to eCall as soon as possible, secondly to proceed with the technical implementation of the 112 emergency number and its specification, thirdly to inform the public about the advantages of the eCall system, fourthly to bring the debate on data protection considerations to a prompt conclusion, and, not least, and right now, to take into account the future new approach when modernising emergency call centres and emergency control units. eCall will give us a foretaste of the possibilities that Galileo will open up to us, not the least of which will be that of creating a number of new jobs in a future-oriented sector, and that is one reason why it is worth our while being committed to this.

 Mr President, I have three comments to make. The first is that, while we welcome the Commission’s move towards the progressive extension of Community agreements with third countries, the far-reaching effects on the transport sector as a whole, on the environment and on competition and the internal market prompt me to urge you to again consider whether foreign policy as it relates to air transport ought not really to be dealt with via the codecision procedure. Secondly, what we expect of the Commission is not only that it should set out its strategic approach, but also that it should draw up a list of countries with which an agreement is a priority and seek to conclude one with them. The Commissioner briefly sketched out what this might be like earlier on. Thirdly, all agreements must be guided by the principle that the first priority is the mutual opening up of markets on an equal basis, it should be borne in mind in the current negotiations with Russia and China that, if the problem with Russia relating to the overflight charges is not sorted out first, an agreement with China would go against the requirement for reciprocity, for the overflight conditions Russia imposes on China are not the same as those imposed on the European airlines, and that is something we cannot accept.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, politics was once defined as the art of the possible. If this definition is true, Parliament has made full use of its possibilities in the face of the widely differing interests in our countries, and also in our parties. We are particularly obliged to the rapporteur for her excellent negotiating skills. Why is this legislation so fundamentally important to us Social Democrats? It brings about a Europe-wide changeover to a system of transport infrastructure costs and thus to fairer user financing of the infrastructure that is calculated on a uniform basis. Differing toll rates and arbitrariness will now be a thing of the past in Europe. At the same time, the legislation means embarking on the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with which we wish to make progress, including by charging for external costs, by the end of this parliamentary term – as both the Commissioner and the Council have told us. Embarking on a system of traffic management via variable toll rates and the fact that these are to be variable from 2010 is important to us in transport-policy terms. This constitutes a real gain in quality. Toll mark-ups in sensitive regions can be used for cross-subsidising environmentally friendly modes of transport, and it is also possible to add toll mark-ups in conurbations and charge tolls on parallel and diverted traffic, which is a current problem in Germany in particular. From 2012, charging tolls on lorries weighing 3.7 tonnes or more will be the rule. The burden of proof for exceptions rests with the Member States, and we have defined these fairly narrowly. I am sure that good transport-policy sense will rule out any exceptions, as the shift in the volume of freight transport to lorries weighing under 12 tonnes in Germany has now resulted in an artificial increase in traffic volume there. I think that we can support this compromise, which we have all achieved together, as a whole, and I eagerly await the next steps we shall take and the discussions we shall hold together here in Parliament on the internalisation of external costs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if a regulation is concluded at first reading, the rapporteur deserves double the praise, especially if it was not a very easy one. The unacceptable practice of some airlines of refusing carriage, on cost grounds, to people with disabilities will be impossible in future. There will be comprehensive, uniform rules at European level for the rights of air passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility; which represents great progress. This is a further step towards the passenger rights for all modes of transport that are so important to us. It will also enable us to take due account of demographic development in our countries and of the increasing mobility of the European public. In future, airport operators will bear clear responsibility for the services to be organised. Some airlines have already put such services in place themselves, and any solutions of theirs that function well will continue to be possible, by agreement and subject to contractual rules.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, flying is safe in Europe, and we want it to remain that way in future, despite high growth rates in air traffic. That is the purpose of the regulation before us today, whose urgent adoption is backed across the political spectrum. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work. A European black list based on common criteria will in future eliminate confusion around decisions on safety issues, as was the case with Onur Air. I am sure that publishing this list will put very strong pressure on airlines that show insufficient regard to international safety regulations, and also to travel companies that have worked with such airlines in the past. Inclusion in the black list will inevitably damage such a carrier’s image and probably drive it out of business, resulting in a clear gain in terms of safety. The duty to provide passengers with information on the identity of the operating air carrier in cases where these has not happened in the past will lead to a marked strengthening of passengers’ rights. We can address small travel agencies’ fears that they will be overburdened by having to provide information by distinguishing between information relevant to safety and information on a change to another, safe airline, and by treating these two different types of information with differing levels of urgency. I welcome Commissioner Barrot’s plans to extend EASA’s powers to support for third-country airlines with safety problems. If we want to achieve that we will of course have to free up a little more money.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, efforts to enable the revitalisation of Europe’s railways began back in 1994. The third railway package now concludes our legislative efforts. The current proposal decided, and decides, on the necessary harmonisation in the technical, administrative and, partly, the social field, along with the gradual liberalisation of all railway services by 2012. This puts in place the preconditions for a European railway culture, with which the railways can regain their significance and competitiveness within the pan-European transport system. The liberalisation efforts in rail transport are not prompted by ideological convictions, but by necessity in terms of transport policy. They owe their existence to the fact that the internal market, the European Economic Area and also the European cultural area need the railways as a mode of transport that does not operate only in separate part-markets. Particularly on the long, cross-border sections, the railways have inherent systemic advantages. This comprehensive reorientation is the only way of countering the heavy losses in terms of transport volume suffered by the railways: in favour of the roads in the case of freight transport, and in favour of the low-cost airlines as well as the roads in the case of passenger transport. It is understandable that some employees should feel anxious about such a radical change. Yet the 18 years that have elapsed between 1994 and 2012 serve to guarantee that it has been, and continues to be, possible to carry through all these changes in a socially viable way. In anticipation of the passenger-rail market organisation, the ICE 3 was approved for France last week, and the TGV will probably follow in the coming year. There will then be direct high-speed trains from Paris to South Germany. Those responsible have read the signs of the times. Adopting the third railway package would mean that we, too, had read the signs of the times. In order to proceed with further revitalisation of the railways, we must put on our agenda the full harmonisation of the conditions of competition between the various modes of transport, finding new sources of finance for the rail infrastructure, and particularly a strategy for improving integration of modes of transport as intermodal passenger transport.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur. The directive on the air traffic controllers’ licence is a significant step towards the realisation of our great goal of a single European sky. For a start, the creation of functional airspace blocks across borders is dependent on it. Secondly, there is now a presumption of harmonised licensing and training at a high level in this area, which also makes air traffic controllers more mobile, something that is urgently needed in view of the fact that Europe is short of some 1 500 of them. Thirdly, standardised rules and regulations at a high level help to improve safety to a marked degree. Let me say at this point how glad I am that the rapporteur has taken on board my idea of implementing harmonised training in crisis management techniques. This will make us better prepared for extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of aircraft. What we see as important as regards increased mobility is that we should be able to reduce excessively stringent requirements as regards local languages – and here I am not talking about English – to justifiable individual instances. This is the only way in which we will be able to prevent market foreclosure through the back door. We Social Democrats also take the trade unions’ concerns seriously, and that is why we want explicit mention in the directive of social dialogue. Particularly in view of the heated debate on the services directive, we also see it as important that the host country principle should apply to air traffic controllers; firstly, as a means of preventing social dumping, and secondly, in order to enable the controllers to work together as a team without that being undermined. Now more than ever, being an air traffic controller is an attractive career, and one that can take you all over Europe, and I hope that it will be one on which even more young people will decide than they have done in the past.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for her truly excellent cooperation with us. Inland navigation is making headway, and RIS will do a little more to dispel the image of a romantic but outdated form of transport. An interoperable cross-border information and communication system will help to realise our vision of making inland navigation as strong as any other link in the transport chain. It would be a wise move to strengthen inland waterway transport in this way, given all the infrastructural developments that are required in other areas of the transport system. RIS brings added value in environmental and economic terms, while also contributing to the overall efficiency of transport policies. Firstly, the improvement of traffic and transport management makes it conceivable that something like the ‘just in time’ approach could be extended to supplies transported on our rivers. RIS provides up-to-date information that can be used in the planning of journeys and the compilation of reliable timetables. It will make individual transport operations safer and more efficient. Secondly, ports will be upgraded to intermodal interfaces. RIS will make it easier for port and terminal operators to maximise the use of their capacities. Thirdly, this directive will finally give us a standardised identification number too, a number plate for inland vessels. Efficient inland navigation makes such a standardised registration number necessary, since it makes vessels identifiable, makes it possible to track consignments and promotes safety. All of these factors will enhance the competitiveness and appeal of inland waterway transport. What remains to be done? The real challenge lies in the interfaces. Ports, of course, are often focal points of economic development, but many of them are not designed and equipped for trimodal operations. There is a great deal to be done here. Further improvements are also needed in the links with short sea shipping, a very fast-growing mode of transport. In this case there are administrative obstacles to be removed. Last but not least, there is the creation and application of the European intermodal loading unit. As you know, we have had the first reading of that draft, and we now await the Council’s common position. I see this as another indispensable step towards the goal of a truly competitive intermodal transport chain. There is still, however, one fly in the ointment, and that is the relatively non-binding nature of this directive. It is for this reason that we now need to adopt without delay the various technical provisions and standards for the implementation of RIS in order to preclude the emergence of a patchwork of divergent RIS applications, if this has not already happened.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rehn, during this sixth legislative period Turkey has been a priority on our EU agenda. Before the start of accession negotiations, Turkey had made huge steps towards reform and the EU recognised this accordingly. Today the mood has changed somewhat. We are growing increasingly concerned about the progress of the democratisation process in Turkey. Freedom of the press, the protection of minorities, but also reform of the judiciary must be monitored constantly. As for the Ergenekon trial which is taking place in Turkey, I would like to say that this must not become politicised. The fact is that arrests and searches are taking place. Hasty comments should be avoided. Careful reporting has an important role to play here. Important progress has been made on the Kurdish question. The solution of the Kurdish problem is central to the process of democratisation and the protection of minorities. However, I also have concerns about the current position of some EU heads of government. Ambiguous signals from the EU also mean that from time to time the democratic process in Turkey faces a bumpy ride. In this respect I would like to recall that a clear commitment on behalf of the EU to Turkey’s full membership would give the reform process a huge boost. Otherwise, there will always be new breeding grounds for fundamentalism and nationalism, and the Kurdish problem will get worse. After all, the common goal is to turn Turkey into a more modern, stable and prosperous democracy, based on a secular state and a pluralistic society. This is not only in Turkey’s interest, it is also an important strategic interest of the European Union.

 Mr President, Mrs Napoletano, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean should revive the Barcelona Process, which was launched in 1995. Unfortunately, we must face the fact today that the recent Middle East crisis has meant the project has not come to fruition. The opening of the secretariat in Barcelona has been postponed indefinitely, and the money promised cannot come in. Thus, there have been no tangible results so far, which I greatly regret. I ask myself whether we have been concentrating too much on institutions, and whether this is the reason for the current impasse. Have we underestimated the influence of political crises on the Union for the Mediterranean? How can we ensure the continuation of the projects? In the history of European integration, we have been very successful in the economic and commercial fields. It is for this very reason that we in the Committee on International Trade have considered how our successful mechanisms could be applied to our neighbours in southern Europe. One objective is the creation of a free trade area by 2010, but this, too, has ground to a halt. It is precisely because political conflicts are blocking this process that we should strengthen the economic field. International trade could have a beneficial effect not only on the economic but also – and particularly – on the political and social situation in the region. Regional economic integration is crucial in this regard. Our southern neighbours must also cooperate more closely with one other. At the same time, the countries that have already developed a network of bilateral trade relations should be convinced of the added value of a multilateral dimension. Communicating the benefits of economic integration to local citizens will play an important role in this. This would be one step towards stabilising the situation in the southern Mediterranean. I wish to see this for the sake of us all, particularly the citizens in the region.

 I welcome the adoption of the resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip. It is imperative that the European Parliament express its views on the crisis. It is the duty of Parliament to condemn this humanitarian disaster, laying claim as it does to moral leadership on respect for human rights. It is precisely because of this that Parliament can no longer remain silent. That is why I voted in favour of this resolution. Nevertheless, Parliament could have sent out a stronger signal; the resolution remains too weak on some points. It is important that we call for a lasting cease-fire and condemn the suffering of the civilian population. It is also our duty to suggest practical solutions for ending the war and to call on the EU to commit itself to these in its role within the Quartet. As the United States is currently in a state of paralysis on account of its change of president, the EU must further increase its sense of duty. A pause in the negotiations on enhancing relations with Israel is called for in view of such excessive military action. Unfortunately, there is no mention of this in the resolution. If Israel does not want to negotiate directly with Hamas, it is up to the EU to work to ensure that others talk to Hamas. The continuation of the military offensive is costing too many lives. Lip service is insufficient in the face of such a severe humanitarian crisis.

The consolidation of economic relations with the Western Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans. I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted the Belder report today. In light of the fact that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans lies with the EU, their economic and political rapprochement to the EU is very important. In order to tie these countries to the EU in the long term, the development of their market economies and regional cooperation must be fostered. That is why constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament are also important. It is in the interests of the EU to champion the creation of political stability, legal security and hence good framework conditions in these countries for foreign investment. The Belder report underlines the fact that the level of economic relations depends on progress in each individual country. Moreover, it should be the EU’s objective to diversify the national economies of the countries of the Western Balkans. All these important aspects are reflected in the report. I am convinced that a positive development in economic relations between the EU and the Western Balkans will be of benefit to all countries on the continent of Europe and I await the implementation of our proposals with anticipation.

 Mr President, the current debate on possible sanctions against Russia in reaction to the conflict in the Caucasus once again shows how irresponsibly sanctions are sometimes handled. It is questionable whether they are legitimate as an all-purpose, non-differentiating instrument and unclear when and how their effectiveness is in fact guaranteed. It is particularly important to evaluate the effectiveness of EU sanctions correctly. They should not be deceptive; on the contrary, they must be tailored. Repressive regimes are often responsible. What evaluation criteria are applied remains a central question, despite all efforts. When do sanctions actually lead to a change in behaviour? Instead of ad hoc sanctions being imposed, I would like an EU strategy resulting in a coherent and sustainable sanctions policy. There would have to be a consensus here on their optimum conditions of use, however. An effective sanctions strategy is still lacking up to now. This report, however, is a step in the right direction. The European Parliament is currently the most important agent for promoting human rights. EU sanctions ought not to be an aggressive political instrument, but should be there in the people’s interest. Sanctions that punish the civil population are counterproductive and miss the actual point.

Mr President, in my view the European enlargement policy has been a great success story. Within fifty years the EU has managed to create a peaceful, democratic and prosperous continent. What strikes me about this report on the EU enlargement strategy, however, is that it also focuses on relations between the EU and countries with no accession prospects. This attempt to water down the enlargement strategy and blend it with the European Neighbourhood Policy poses problems. Although the report deals with many very interesting substantive issues and makes good points, these would be at home in a report on the ENP but are out of place in an enlargement report. I am thinking, for example, of the proposals for a Mediterranean Union and a Black Sea Union. The enlargement policy of the EU should remain quite separate from the European Neighbourhood Policy. Instead, I regret to say that the report contains some very vague and even confusing statements which leave room for diverse interpretations.

 Mr President, of course it is in the interests of all the people of the EU, and especially of the countries bordering the Baltic Sea, that no danger should be posed to the environment. However, once all environmental reservations have been dispelled nothing else should stand in the way of the Baltic pipeline, for the EU is reliant both on the diversification of energy sources and on the diversification of energy transit routes too. The EU will have to import an additional 200 billion cubic metres of gas every year from 2012. If we are to secure our future energy supplies then every pipeline is important for the EU: the Baltic Sea pipeline represents a complementary energy route and should not therefore be regarded as being in competition with other projects. Politically based arguments should not stand in the way of the economic interests of the EU. Any differences between the eastern and western European Member States should have been settled in advance. In future this task could be left to a ‘Mister Energy for Europe’. Misunderstandings and disagreements could be avoided ahead of events by means of coordination, transparency and the exchange of information. This discussion again highlights the need for a common and coordinated EU foreign policy.

 Madam President, the month of June was the bloodiest for foreign soldiers since the end of the Taliban regime in 2001. More than 48 coalition troops were killed, which is more than lost their lives over the same period in Iraq. Since the beginning of the year violence in Afghanistan has cost the lives of more than 2 200 people. What we have in Afghanistan is not a solitary conflict but a regional war that could develop further. The situation is now more serious than it was in 2001. In view of this alarming state of affairs, Afghanistan must remain an absolute priority for Europe. The presence of European troops and the EU’s civil operations in the country is playing a key role. After lengthy negotiations in committee, I support the final version of our motion for a resolution, which contains many key elements, including the systematic training of the Afghan security forces, greater focus on the rebuilding of civil society and enhanced coordination between the international bodies.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate President Sarkozy for once, albeit reluctantly, at this juncture. With the rumpus that he has created over EU-Mediterranean relations, he has actually managed to give the Barcelona Process, which has existed since 1995, the higher profile and visibility that it deserves, and has unleashed a new debate about our neighbouring region to the South. Looking at the outcomes, however, it is clear that Mr Sarkozy's original idea, launched in February 2007, has failed on three counts. Firstly, a possible alternative to EU accession for Turkey was effectively banished by Spain and Italy with the declaration adopted in Rome in December 2007. Then Chancellor Merkel ensured that EU-Mediterranean relations would be developed further within the existing EU structures. Finally, the Commission has now applied the brakes to Mr Sarkozy's ambitious plans for the secretariat and leadership structure of the project. It is apparent, in other words, that go-it-alone approaches by Mr Sarkozy will not be tolerated in the European Union.

Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, may I voice my praise and respect for this report. It is balanced and fair, and that is a line which we should keep to today. We are right to emphasise that Turkey has to make further efforts. The goal of achieving a stable and prosperous democracy in Turkey is not only in Turkey’s own interests, but is also an important strategic interest of the EU. I am concerned about the attitude of the incoming Council President, Mr Sarkozy. His policy on Turkey does not aim to achieve EU accession for Turkey. He is insisting on references to Turkey as an accession candidate being deleted from EU documents, and emphasises that France will only endorse the opening of chapters which do not aim at full membership. The EU’s credibility is at stake here. Let me underline one point: pacta sunt servanda!
 The opening of accession negotiations was agreed unanimously, and that means that France agreed to it as well. Instead of sending out negative signals, the EU should deal constructively with Turkey.

Madam President, renewed interest in Africa throughout the world is attended by a change in perspective. Today Africa is more than just a continent of poverty. There are growth rates of up to 10% in some African countries. Now to the heart of the matter: what is China looking for in Africa? Its most important motive for commitment there is energy resources. In the battle for access to raw materials, however, Western value-based policy draws the shorter straw increasingly frequently. Europe’s most important motive is Africa’s sustainable development. A joint EU-Chinese plan for Africa would be ideal in theory. We should not be claiming to be the good guys here, because the countries of Africa mistrust the EU just as much as China. The EU cannot provide solutions for either China or Africa. In any case the EU must carry on tying commitment to conditions. At the same time it should be promoting governments, institutions and civil society more strongly than it has hitherto. Dialogue with Africa is necessary, but should not overlook grievances. On this note I can but support Mrs Gomes’s report.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Mr Özdemir on his very successful report. The European Union joined the race for Central Asia with very hesitant steps and was late to take an interest in the region, following behind Russia, China and the USA. Until now, Central Asia has not perceived the European Union as a global player. An EU strategy for Central Asia is long overdue, especially as a means of reducing its energy dependence on Russia. The German Presidency initiated it. It is important that we now see a follow-up. Sadly it keeps emerging that the EU still does not speak with one voice in its external energy policy. We in Europe should focus above all on diversification, on representing our common interests and on solidarity in the event of crises. Yet the bilateral energy agreements the EU Member States concludes with third countries keep putting in question the European Union’s ability to take a common stand. But it is in the interest of the European Union and its citizens to pursue a common external energy policy. We must not, however, regard energy supplies, which are extremely important to our citizens, as the only reason for EU relations with that region. We are not trying to profit unilaterally from a strategy for Central Asia. In that respect Europe must distinguish itself from other players in the region. It is far more a question of helping the Central Asian republics to develop the rule of law and democratic forms of society, together with a sound economy. If Europe does that, the citizens of the region should become far more aware of it. Yet Europe must also move with the necessary caution, because advice from the West could all too easily be mistaken for patronisation or intervention. The world is growing closer together outside the EU too and we should seek a constructive partnership with the Central Asian countries, a partnership that does not give the impression that Europeans are concerned only with what is useful to them, a partnership founded on mutual advantage.

Mr President, at the EU summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003, the Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their support for the development of a European perspective in the Western Balkans, where Montenegro is the newest successor state of the former Yugoslavia, having declared its independence from Serbia in 2006. Since then, its relations with the European Union have become ever closer, and Montenegro has clearly chosen to steer a European course. I particularly welcome the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 18 October, which marks a milestone in relations between Montenegro and the EU. It brings numerous benefits to that small Balkan country, particularly in business and trade, for it provides for a free-trade area as well as facilitating investment and business cooperation. On 19 October 2007 little more than a year after the declaration of independence, another important aim was achieved when the Montenegrin Parliament adopted the country’s first Constitution, which will play a particularly important role in forging the identity of this young nation. It establishes Montenegro as a democratic, liberal and environmental state based on the rule of law. That is a great success. Montenegro still has a long way to go to attain membership of the EU, but remaining obstacles are being dismantled bit by bit. There is still a particular need for progress in the struggle against the informal economy and corruption. The functioning of a free and independent judicial system, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and, above all, reform processes in the spheres of democratisation, human rights and the protection of minorities are indispensable for Montenegro and its future in the EU. The initial priority must be the successful implementation of the reforms prescribed by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. On 1 January 2008 Slovenia, another of Yugoslavia’s successor states, will take over the Presidency of the EU Council. It is gratifying that one of the priorities of the Slovenian presidency will be the Western Balkans. The security and stability of the Western Balkans are a paramount interest of the region itself and of the whole of Europe. A democratic and stable Montenegro can and should play a major role in the pursuit of these goals. Let me close by emphasising that the prospect of Montenegro acceding to the EU one day, albeit in the more distant future, is the main generator of further reform processes. We in the European Parliament should support Montenegro on its way towards the EU.

Mr President, in plenary this afternoon we debated the European neighbourhood policy. Following the enlargement round of 2004, the European Commission proposed the development of a coherent strategy towards the Union’s new neighbours. The ENP has created special links with a ring of countries that share the EU’s fundamental values and aims. Our neighbour Ukraine is firmly embedded in the ENP. We are aware of the special geopolitical and commercial importance of Ukraine as a natural bridge between the EU on the one hand and Russia and Central Asia on the other. Today the EU is Ukraine’s main trading partner; by 2006, the volume of trade between Ukraine and the Member States of the EU had already reached EUR 26.6 billion. We in the European Union acknowledge the great efforts that have been made in Ukraine in recent years. The former command economy has been developed into an efficient market economy. According to the OECD report, Ukraine’s economic growth averaged 7.6% in the years from 2000 to 2006. That is a great success. In February 2007 we began negotiations on a new partnership and association agreement between Ukraine and the EU. The Ukrainian aspirations to EU and NATO membership are also well documented. For reasons of trade and economic policy, accession to the World Trade Organization is at the very top of the Ukrainian agenda. We assume that accession to the WTO will prove possible before the end of this year. This would also considerably broaden the scope for cooperation between the EU and Ukraine and smooth the way for negotiations on the creation of a free-trade area in the ENP framework. The EU must treat Ukraine as a genuine partner and give it clear messages. In this respect I can only welcome the outcome of the EU-Ukraine summit held in Kiev on 14 September 2007, where the strong and enduring relationship between the two parties was reaffirmed. We should continue to lend vigorous support to Ukraine on its path to WTO membership, in the subsequent creation of a free-trade area, and with regard to its European aspirations.

Madam President, Commissioner, Airbus is a European success story and a model of European cooperation. Airbus provides jobs at six European locations and employs a total of 58 000 workers. In Hamburg, where I come from, there are 12 000 people working for Airbus. In the past, Airbus has shown that EU industry, given the right strategy, can compete successfully in the toughest markets with top technology. In the dispute between the US company Boeing and the European Airbus, each side is accusing the other of paying billions in subsidies and brought complaints before the WTO in 2004. This could have negative consequences for transatlantic trade relations, which I would warn against, but it is very important, nonetheless, that the EU makes it clear that the financial support provided for Airbus was in conformity with WTO rules. Both sides have declared their willingness to find a solution outside the WTO and reach an agreement on a bilateral basis. Our goal, as politicians, should be to avoid a dispute over subsidies in the aircraft industry. The economic performance of the two companies must not be jeopardised, and financial support should focus primarily on research. This must include an increasingly strong emphasis on environmental, social and indeed employment policy aspects. It is important, for the competitiveness of European industry, to ensure that Airbus also remains competitive. In the European Parliament, we must stand up for fair competition. The Commission must act on this, for we all have an interest in ensuring that by 2010, the EU is the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Economic and employment policy, combined with innovative technology policy, will play an extremely important role in achieving that goal.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s resolution on Turkey, the European Parliament is sending out a positive signal and has thus entered a new phase of constructive dialogue in its relations with Turkey. Turkey is currently involved in an intense debate about internal reforms. Turkey now has a government in power which has a clear popular mandate and can set to work. This is a chance to give fresh impetus to the accession process in several key areas. Calling for additional requirements to be met which are not part of the accession negotiations is counterproductive. In Turkey, the development of a new constitution is now the highest priority. The outline of this constitution is already discernible. The call for the revision of Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code is being considered by the Turkish side. Turkey now needs further positive signals from the EU. We must encourage Turkey to continue this reform process with great zeal. The Commission’s progress report is expected on 7 November, and I think it is very important that the current positive developments in Turkey are reflected in that report.

 Mr President, in December 2004, with 402 votes in favour, this Parliament took a clear decision to open accession negotiations with Turkey. This sent out a clear signal. Today we are debating the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, a report whose intention should actually be constructive monitoring of negotiations with Turkey and of its accession process. It strikes me, however, that this Eurlings report tends to lose sight of our objective – Turkey’s membership of the EU. I ask myself what we want, therefore. Is it for Turkey to continue on its reform path – in which case we should treat it fairly – or are we saying that whatever it does it will never become a member of the EU? Our Turkish partners are confronted with an assortment of bad examples. The progress achieved and good examples are almost completely ignored. This is not fair treatment. It is true that Turkey needs to do further work on its process of reform. It is also true that it needs to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol: human rights, democracy and protection of minorities are preconditions for EU accession. If Turkey meets the criteria already laid down and continues to drive forward its process of reform, we, too, must hold to the goal of EU membership. That should be upheld in our report. I would consider this a very clear signal. If the rapporteur or Parliament disagrees, that must be stated in a report on Turkey, otherwise half-truths such as these will diminish Parliament’s credibility. We took a decision in Strasbourg in October 2005 to open accession negotiations with Turkey, and we must hold to it today. I have always said that Turkey was not yet ready for accession, but was ready to start negotiations. Europe should show understanding and solidarity in acknowledging and supporting this.

 Mr President, in December last year, this House came to a decision, voting by 402 votes to 216, in favour of a start being made on accession talks with Turkey. I have to say that I fail to see either why it is that some apparently find that impossible to swallow, or why this whole scheme of things is again being called into question. If a decision we have taken is then openly questioned, what is left of this House’s credibility? That is one issue, and Cyprus is another. I would be very glad if people were to devote some of the vehemence with which they campaign for Turkish recognition of Cyprus to the cause of the Turkish members of the Cypriot nation, with whom we should also concern ourselves, by urging us to exert pressure on the government of Cyprus to work for lasting reunification, as provided for in another plan. One-sided pressure I regard as unfair, for, at the end of the day, this is about a part of a nation – the Turkish Cypriots – who really have lost out, who have not managed to obtain what is rightfully theirs. This House must take account of these people’s rights too. As a republic, Cyprus consists not only of the Greek Cypriots; there are Turkish Cypriots there as well, and who, in this Parliament, is standing up for the rights of these people?

We are on the verge of an extremely important decision, not only in terms of its impact on all of Europe but also, in this age of globalisation, in its effects on the political map of the world. Shall we have the intellectual and moral strength to take the decision on the opening of negotiations calmly, boldly and in accordance with the dictates of political logic? Opponents of the report have once again been trying to restart the discussion on new terms, some of which are based on falsehoods, raising many of the hurdles that have already been cleared and adding many more. Let me emphasise that I must respect the views of those among us who do not wish to support the opening of negotiations on Turkish accession, but I cannot accept any arguments that are completely divorced from reality or any allegations of the type that have been made over the past weekend by various German Conservatives. The assertion that Turkey would import terrorism and gangsterism is libellous and an insult to our NATO ally. The debate must not be dragged down to that level. Since 1963, the Community and Brussels have acknowledged that Turkey is part of Europe, and in December 2002 the European Union pledged itself to begin negotiations with Turkey once the latter had fulfilled the stipulated criteria. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Political honesty means abiding by agreements and keeping promises. The scope and impact of the reforms that are currently being enacted in Turkey are unprecedented in recent centuries. Democracy there is more stable than it has ever been. The country is registering high economic growth rates. Turkey will always stand guarantor for the security of the whole of Europe. A European Turkey will serve as a shining example for the entire Islamic world and hence for numerous crisis-torn regions too. Turkey ... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, we are to vote on the report of my colleague Mrs Rothe regarding the financial support of Northern Cyprus. This is good news: Northern Cyprus needs this aid. Over the last few decades events have separated the island politically and economically. The people of Cyprus suffered immensely from the partition of the island. All those involved must do their best to overcome the separation. It was the explicit aim of the United Nations and the EU that a united Cyprus would join the European Union on 1 May 2004. The governments of Northern Cyprus and Turkey have followed the steps laid out by the United Nations and the EU. The population of Northern Cyprus has overwhelmingly supported the unification of the island as well as EU accession. A united Cyprus could already be a member of the EU today. Unfortunately, that has not yet happened. It is our responsibility to encourage the two parts of the island to cooperate. The regulation on financial support that we are discussing today is the first step. The second step will be the regulation on special conditions for trade. The Council should finalise that regulation without delay, firstly, to allow for an improvement in economic conditions of Northern Cyprus; and secondly, to facilitate the rapprochement of the two sides through trade. This rapprochement can also support change in both parts of the island. During the times of the German Ostpolitik, we called this concept Wandel durch Annährung
. More steps must follow soon. The ultimate aim must be the reunification of Cyprus.

 Madam President, I am pleased that you are in the chair for a second time for a debate on maritime policy. You were also there a year ago. Commissioner, let us start with the good news. This evening the first European Maritime Day event will be taking place in St James’s Church in Lübeck. This church houses the international memorial for civil maritime navigation. Commissioner Barrot opened it last year. Captains will be discussing their living and working conditions there this evening. The pastors have been relying upon the Presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to actually declare 20 May European Maritime Day this afternoon. This is a reason to rejoice and it should cause Europe to pay more attention to its seas. Only those who believe that a day such as this is also in fact maritime policy are indeed mistaken; a Maritime Day such as this should not degenerate into mere symbolism. That means it must be part of a political framework. Policy is required – for social matters, maritime safety and climate protection. Let us take living and working conditions on board ships: it is an evil anachronism that a whole range of social and employment protection regulations do not apply to seafarers. This has to change and the Commission also sees that it has to change. We await their initiatives here. The International Labour Organization adopted the Maritime Labour Convention in 2006. Three States have so far ratified it: the Bahamas, Liberia and the Marshall Islands. Where do Europeans actually stand here? If the Council wants to improve navigational and maritime safety, it simply has to do one thing: finally adopt the Erika III package. It is a bit much that the Council is dealing with this issue of maritime safety in such a dilatory manner. In the meantime, more than 12 months have elapsed since first reading in Parliament and so far we still do not have single united standpoint. The Erika and Prestige disasters should in fact be sufficient warning and reminder to take action at long last. The climate protection package, put forward by Commission President Barroso in January refers to the possibility of perhaps including maritime transport in emissions trading. This is too lax; it is not enough. In my view maritime policy has to achieve at least four things regarding climate protection: inclusion of maritime transport in emissions trading - now, not whenever; a radical reduction in pollutant emissions – CO2
, SO2

; and use of regenerative energies such as wind and solar energy. In the ports there has to be an end to ships’ engines producing their own energy to the detriment of people and nature. Conversely, we also need to supply energy from land, so ships in port must be connected up to a power outlet. In the North Sea and Baltic Sea we have dozens of old munitions from past wars. Formidable hazards arise from these. We therefore need a plan of action to identify and remove this old, harmful waste. In recent months we have learnt that pirates have carried out attacks on Europeans and European ships off the African coast. We therefore need clear international regulations and a support system on the high seas and we must protect not only the coasts from the seas, but also the seas from the coasts. The greatest hazard for the seas still comes from the land: 80% of all emissions of pollutants are caused by agriculture or industry. In order to find a remedy, European law must ultimately be applied and enforced here, too. When we declare 20 May European Maritime Day after the vote this afternoon, I hope that we will be able to say on 20 May next year: we have achieved a great deal in the meantime. You see how it was a precision landing. (Applause)

Madam President, this is unfortunately the problem in the end. I hope that at least the Commissioner can understand me. I would first like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate. I am convinced that integrated maritime policy, as the Commission has put forward, from shipyards via ships, ports and fisheries research to tourism, can be an enormous opportunity for Europeans if they, too, take advantage of it. Commissioner, you have heard: the Commission has Parliament's full support to proceed a little more boldly, a little more energetically. I know about the difficulties you have with the Council, but this should not prevent you from boldly putting your own ideas into practice and promoting them. You have approached the IMO. It is good, of course, if the IMO has resolved upon something in terms of climate protection and reduction, but you know how laborious it also is for the Member States to sign IMO resolutions. Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned to the coastguard. If we both persuade our government that it should first have a coastguard itself, I hope that we shall achieve this. The Commission incidentally still has one more job to carry out here, namely to produce a modest survey on this. Lastly, we still know far too little about the seas. A great deal of research and funds are therefore required from Europeans in order to learn more about the seas, and if we now bring these into being in connection with the European Maritime Day, we have done something good. As Mrs Stihler has said: next year we hope to be able to record some progress. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski, the reason the state of Hamburg now has a black-green government is so that the Conservatives can learn a thing or two about all this. That is excellent. I would first like to congratulate Mrs Ţicău, as it is her first report. She did a very good job, as of course, did Mr Grosch, of whom Parliament has come to expect good reports. I was somewhat startled by the questions put from outside. We are not trying to reinvent road transport with these three reports, but rather to determine how best to organise it and also ultimately how to raise the safety criteria, because there are a great many companies that want to use the roads. Finally, we are also interested in how social protection is connected with all this. The freeing up of cabotage should not really pose any problems either. As has already been mentioned, unladen journeys are of no benefit to anybody. They make no sense at all. However, we do need to ensure that the situation does not get completely out of control. Therefore, it would make sense for us to resolve tomorrow that we will check, in 2012, what has happened by then, and how everything has developed, so that we build in some reserve, as it were - and there is an amendment in this vein by Mr Grosch, which we support. By 2014, when everything is supposed to launch fully, it also should be provided with a safety clause. In the event that serious disruption to the market does occur, a Member State can then say ‘We are pressing the emergency button and going to the Commission. This is a case that requires a remedy.’ My final point concerns the 12-day rule. I have always supported it; we supported it at the time. Now, however, a new situation has arisen, in which the unions and the hauliers have reached an agreement. That could cause problems with the amendments. Therefore, tomorrow, we would be very much in favour of postponing by a month acceptance of the report that contains the part about coaches and deal with it later, in June, when it is fully ready. To do it that way would make sense and would also involve the industry.

I beg to point out that Amendment 1 should not be placed after paragraph 4 but after paragraph 146; that was agreed with the author of the amendment. This paragraph does not belong at the beginning but at the end of the resolution. I would be grateful if you could arrange for that to be done.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in its maritime policy the European Parliament is entering uncharted waters. Five committees worked on the report, and achieved respectable results. I would like to begin by extending my heartfelt thanks to my co-rapporteurs MrHassi, Mr Stevenson, Mr Chatzimarkakis and Mr Matsis for their collaboration. My thanks also to the members of my staff, Mrs Jordan and Mrs Schramm – as well as the stagaire Jan, who did some good research work – for without staff this report would have been practically impossible to make. Ladies and gentlemen, let us just get an idea of the position as regards maritime policy: 90% of the European Union’s external and 40% of its internal trade is carried by sea. 40% of Europe’s GDP is generated in coastal areas. About two-thirds of all Europeans prefer holidaying by the sea, and coastal tourism in 2004 earned EUR 72 billion in revenue. But coastal tourism presupposes clean seas. This makes it clear that it is necessary – indeed, it is a sine qua non
 – that the EU not only formulate, but implement an integrated maritime policy. It is to the Commission’s great credit that with this Green Paper it has brought maritime policy on to the European agenda. However, the paper is frequently vague and descriptive, rather than specific. After a year of consultations, what we need is fewer conferences and more measures, more concrete political actions, as Goethe said, ‘A truce to words, mere empty sound, let deeds at length appear, my friends! Commissioner, if tomorrow we approve the report, the Commission – and of course the Member States – will have plenty of work on their hands. My staff have done the calculations: the draft report contains 80 recommendations for the Commission and the Council. If we draw these together broadly, there will still be 33 bundles of measures which we expect the Council and the Commission to implement in the future. Today I would like to focus on a few important areas, such as shipping. We expect the Council to approve seven legislative measures on maritime safety without delay: state port inspections, emergency moorings, liability after accidents, amongst others – and these are addressed to the Portuguese Presidency alone. There is a peculiar anachronism in that Europe still views short-haul voyages as international trade. For this reason, coasting must finally be integrated into the single market. On the issue of motorways of the sea, since the adoption of the trans-European networks in 2004, we have not made an inch of progress. The Commission must appoint a coordinator for this to finally get things moving. Combating climate change: although marine transport is comparatively the most eco-friendly means of transport, it is not squeaky clean: it contributes to 4% of world CO2 emissions, and also produces large quantities of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. I am certain that emissions trading in shipping is something we will have to face up to. An even more important issue, though, is to drastically reduce marine emissions and at the same time to use renewable energy like wind and solar power on vessels. This also provides European shipbuilding and its suppliers with huge potential for growth. And, by far not least important, LeaderSHIP 2015 is about the future competitiveness of the entire industry. Maritime climate policy also involves our, wherever possible, providing vessels in port with power from the land, which also involves implementing the Commission’s long overdue action plan on promoting offshore wind energy. And on the matter of employment: if the maritime sector complains that young people are unwilling to embark on maritime careers, we should ask ourselves, how actively were these careers promoted in the past? For this reason we need an education campaign. It is also right and proper, though, that those employed on vessels should not be second-class employees. About marine pollution: 100% of waste from vessels must be removed in port. Illegal discharges of oil must be combated. At the same time, however, because 80% of marine pollution is caused by waste originating on land, we need a concrete action plan form the Commission to provide aid for this. On the issue of marine research: in the European Union we have excellent institutes, but they are not linked with each other. For this reason we need a blanket organisation, a European marine science consortium, with strong backing from the Commission. Madam President, far be it from me to moralise, but it is an indisputable fact that the sea does not need us, but we need it. And this being the case, we need a good, integrated European marine policy. For that reason we will measure every Council Presidency by the progress it makes in marine policy. (Applause)

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and tomorrow's vote on the five reports on maritime safety conclude the first reading of the Erika 
III package. I stress this because, as you know, we have already adopted the reports from Marta Vincenzi and Gilles Savary. This is why I must also remind the Council once again that Erika 
III comprises seven proposals and that we in Parliament are firmly convinced that they form a package, which we therefore want to deal with collectively. Since I am speaking in more than one capacity – not only on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries but also for my political group – I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work. Like the votes in committee, tomorrow's plenary vote will show that we are addressing all these matters on the basis of a high degree of unanimity. As we have heard, the Council has not exactly been dancing for joy at some of our parliamentary decisions and votes and still has to engage in discussions on a number of points. How closely the individual proposals are interconnected is illustrated by the Sterckx report. I need hardly say that it would be a good thing if the Member States designated emergency port facilities and places of refuge once and for all. It would also be beneficial if an independent authority in every country determined what should actually happen after a shipwreck, so that such an incident would not trigger the establishment of discussion forums but a decision. In the event of a shipping disaster, it is, of course, inconceivable that the skipper of the rescue craft would ask the captain whether he was insured, and, on being told that the shipowner had not insured the vessel properly, would then refuse to help and return to base. It goes without saying that the rescue crew would have to render assistance. The question about insurance has to be asked as part of the port-State control process. That is also what is envisaged in the Vlasto report, on which we reached agreement. Where we were not entirely in agreement, as Dirk Sterckx has already mentioned, was the question of which fishing vessels should be equipped with which systems. This is all about maximising safety. I remain convinced that it makes little sense to equip vessels less than 24 metres in length with automatic identification systems and that the same results could certainly be achieved with other shore-based resources. Accident statistics do not tell us much. To be consistent, we would have to include all private craft, not only the small fishing vessels. It may be, however, that another technological solution will emerge in future. Let me make a few remarks on port-State control, partly on behalf of my honourable colleague Robert Navarro, who cannot be here today. I believe it makes good sense to abandon the rigid principle of checking 25% of vessels. That was probably quite necessary as a first step, but checking 25% in every Member State is less useful than what is now in the offing, namely concentration on high-risk vessels. This means checking all suspect operators, from the black sheep to those in every tone of grey from dark to light. There is little point, however, in checking white sheep. A targeted checking process is undoubtedly the logical approach. One thing, however, is absolutely crucial, and it has been missing from the Commission's proposals, although we stressed the need for it in both the Sterckx report and the report from the temporary committee on improving safety at sea (the MARE Committee). Everything relating to the human factor – the welfare dimension, in other words good working conditions on board – affects the safety of a ship. As well as a ship being in good technical order, it is certainly essential that the welfare of those on board should be guaranteed. If that is not the case, the general safety of the vessel will be diminished. As we have repeatedly said in this House, 80% of accidents result from human error. This is why we need more proposals from the Commission that relate to this human factor, including ideas on safety monitoring. Only then can this matter be closed.

 Mr President, if I told my mother that we debated maritime safety at 11 p.m. after football, she would probably say: you Brussels people are crazy. At this stage I would not disagree with her. Nevertheless, it is good that the Commission has tabled this proposal because it is necessary. In the Committee on Improving Safety at Sea (MARE), we have called for the European Union to become active in the fields of flag State requirements and liability and compensation. At this point I should like to express particular thanks to the two rapporteurs, my colleagues, Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary, because both reports are tricky in terms of content and politically very controversial. In addition, so far we have not heard any cheering, euphoria or shouts of ‘bravo’ from the Council. That is why at this stage we should say once more to the Council – because there have clearly been misunderstandings – that the fact that we are debating these two reports today does not mean that we are giving up on the Erika III package with its seven dossiers, but rather that we are underlining the particular political importance of these two reports. The Council, which is trying at Mr Savary’s request to interpret the concept of ‘gross negligence’, would therefore be very grossly negligent itself if it were labouring under this misconception. I agree with Mr Jarzembowski: the Council’s attitude towards the Vincenzi report is very difficult to understand. What is actually the problem with incorporating valid IMO rules into European law? Similarly, in the Savary report what is the problem with including chemical pollution in a civil liability regime alongside oil pollution? That cannot actually be the problem. In any case common sense would support these proposals. The message of these two reports is: the Member States should bear more responsibility for ships flying their flag and both the Member States and shipowners should bear more responsibility if something happens. These matters are overdue: think of the Erika
 and the Prestige
. Thank you, Commission, for the proposals. Thank you to the rapporteurs. Now the Council is asked to conduct itself properly and not be grossly negligent.

 Even though the dangers to air travel inherent in terrorism must be neither underestimated nor downplayed, any measures that impose restrictions on passengers must result in real improvements in security, and there is, regrettably, no indication of that which has been enacted by the Commission and the Council since November having actually had that effect. Day-to-day life on Europe’s airports is characterised by impenetrable rules that frequently vary from one airport to another, by hopelessly overworked staff and frequently despairing and angry passengers, who find themselves, for example, deprived even of their contact lens solution. It is because it is to the detriment of passengers that they are told they are being kept safe, while that cannot be guaranteed in a crisis situation that the Commission and the Council must revise the relevant regulation. What is needed is for reasonable, understandable and effective rules to be laid down in good time for the holiday season, and it would be sensible, when drafting them, to listen to those who have to put them into practice in airports.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is hard to imagine a mode of transport that is in such urgent need of political support as the railways. The third railway package brings us a little further forward. There is nothing controversial about the Savary and Sterckx reports, and I should like to thank the rapporteurs. Not only train drivers, but other staff, too, must be covered. We should not concern ourselves exclusively with passengers on cross-border services, but with passengers in general. The controversial issue is – as it always has been – how to deal with market opening. Both we and the Council have traditionally made heavy weather of this issue. This has a good deal to do with national safeguard mechanisms, but it also has to do with fears. These positions must of course be respected, but they do not help us achieve a result. We could of course disregard the liberalisation of rail transport if it were not for the fact that – as has been pointed out several times – other transport sectors have been liberalised without regard for the social or environmental costs in recent years, with disastrous consequences. Tremendous growth in road and air traffic has been recorded for the 1995–2004 period, whilst the railways have been lagging behind and stagnating. The future looks even more bleak. By 2020, the volume of freight transport will have increased by 50%, and that of passenger transport by 35%, yet the various modes of transport will not benefit equally from the expected 35% increase in passenger transport. The increase will be 108% for the aeroplane, 36% for the car, and just 19% for the railways. These are the Commission’s projections. No one can seriously be happy about these figures. It may well be that increases in passenger numbers are already being seen at national level; but we have to look at the overall picture. The realisation that it takes one person a 17 000 km rail journey to release a tonne of CO2 pollution into the atmosphere, but a journey of just 3 000 km by air, does lead one to reconsider one’s position on the opening of rail markets. What we are discussing today is not the Meijer report, as that will have its turn soon, nor the ports package, but instead – for reasons of energy and environmental policy – we are discussing market opening. I would say to Mrs Roth, on the subject of exacting requirements, that 2017/2022 is hardly a sledgehammer approach, but a very gentle one, one that also takes the smaller Member States into consideration. Both the Council and Parliament have incorporated safeguard mechanisms for the smaller Member States. These countries obviously need special protection and consideration. I shall repeat that, if the railways are to have a real chance, we must permit a measure of market opening in this field. I look forward to the conciliation procedure and hope that the Council Presidency will be very active and willing to compromise, and will bring the matter to a successful conclusion.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with tomorrow’s vote the European driving licence will at last be cut and dried. It has taken a long time, it is a compromise, but with effective and significant steps forward. The most important advance is perhaps that it will put an end to the unspeakable driving licence tourism. If, for example, someone’s licence is withdrawn for drunken driving in Germany today, they can easily, and quite cheaply, get a new one in a neighbouring country and then drive on Europe’s roads again completely legally. This scandal will be put to an end. This trick has been played one last time; it will now be laid to rest, and a good job too. Freedom of movement for drivers in Europe is a plus. With more than 110 different driving licences, however, controls are more than problematic. The so-called ‘grey rag’ in Germany, that was issued in the fifties or sixties with a nice, youthful photograph, and which has been in the washing machine at least four times, is certainly a fine piece of nostalgia, but it is no longer any use as identification at police checks. Personally – and many other honourable Members obviously agree with me – I think the 26 year deadline that has now been negotiated for exchanging licences is much too long; it is more of a biological solution than a real practical one. It has been pointed out that Member States can do it earlier. We shall see. All the accident statistics clearly show that most road deaths occur among young men between the ages of 18 and 25 on motorcycles. Progressive access to a motorcycle licence is therefore sensible. It will save human lives and improve road safety. On behalf of my Group, sincere thanks are due to Mr Grosch, the rapporteur, who has negotiated well, and so there will be no transitional periods, no exemptions and no restrictions in tomorrow’s vote: we shall back you wholeheartedly and unanimously, together taking the matter to a successful conclusion. Thank you for your work!

 Mr President, if we want to know about the consequences and repercussions of bad and old single-hull tankers, we must go to the Breton or Galician coast and talk to the people who live there. The names Erika
 and Prestige
 bring back terrible memories for them. The Commission’s Erika
 packages were a sensible response to those disasters. They include Regulation 417/2002 with the more rapid introduction of double-hull tankers and the ban on carrying heavy-grade oil to and from European ports in single-hull tankers. The Commission’s proposal that tankers carrying heavy-grade oil under European flags must now be double-hull tankers is consistent and brings a little more safety for shipping and the sea. You see, Commissioner, Parliament is able to accept and commend proposals from yourself without more ado. Now, as Christmas approaches, the Commission should again be complimented for such good proposals, to which no one can object! Parliament need not be perturbed if the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, Intertanko, is not exactly pleased at the Commission’s proposal. Mr Le Rachinel, the rapporteur, was well advised to give priority to maritime safety and not to Intertanko, and at this point I want to say a sincere thank you to him on behalf of my Group. I therefore expect that we shall have a good vote in Parliament tomorrow over all, thereby making our seas a little safer.

 Mr President, it is most appropriate that we should be debating this today, and that we can expect it to be adopted by a large majority tomorrow, for the EMSA is to be officially opened, in Lisbon, on 14 September, and it will not be able to do its work properly without a sound financial basis. I believe that that is what we are establishing by means of this regulation for funding action in response to maritime pollution. As has frequently been said, we regard EUR 154 million from 2007 to 2013 as the very least that is required, and we will also, over this period, look carefully to see what improvements might have to be made. I can assure Mrs Haug that we are already keeping an eye out to see that nothing is wasted and to ensure that, on the contrary, it is properly funded and is taking the proper steps. What it clear is that the Member States will not be discharged from their responsibilities. All the EMSA can do is to support them and supplement what they do. It has to be emphasised that maritime pollution is not just something that happens as a result of disasters. We know about the ‘Prestige’ and ‘Erika’ disasters, but our seas are being fouled day in and day out by illegal discharges of oil; if the environmental protection organisations are right in their calculations, these happen 3 000 times a year in European waters. Something must be done about this, and I very much hope that the satellite monitoring system that the EMSA is to help set up will enable us to make a better job of dealing with the criminal acts in our waters. Another cause for rejoicing is that the rapporteur, who was rather unwell before the summer, is back with us again, so that we can, so to speak, join with him tomorrow in getting this regulation on the road, and that he has, together with the Council, managed to come up with some good solutions, for which we are very grateful, and we have got this done and dusted at first reading stage, with no need of a conciliation procedure. To sum up, our adoption of this regulation tomorrow will see this House and the Council making an important contribution towards clean and better protected seas in Europe. I hope that this demonstration of Europe’s concern for clean waters will lead the public to value the European Union more highly.

 The Bolkestein directive aimed at social dumping and deregulation. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has succeeded in turning this directive into its precise opposite. The country-of-origin principle has been dropped, to be replaced by indiscriminate market access. The labour laws of the place where the services are performed are to apply. The directive on the posting of workers continues to apply without restriction and it will be necessary to amend it. Derogations are in place for temporary work and contracting. We call on the Council to desist from standing in the way of European legislation. The directive does not apply to services of general interest, and only in part to those of general economic interest. We call for a European framework directive with separate provisions applicable to this essential sector. As the legislative process continues, a number of aspects will need attention. For example, the fundamental freedoms of workers, as defined in the EU’s ‘Monti clause’, will need to take precedence over the rules of business life. The rights of codecision and codetermination, being founded upon the law, must not be undermined. Due regard shall consistently be had to the legitimate interests of the common good, as defined by Article 4.7a in conformity with the jurisprudence of the ECJ. Legally founded obligations in the interests of workers from a given country and from elsewhere (mandatory contributions to trade associations, holiday funds, etc.) must apply to those performing services both at home and across frontiers. Nothing must be done that might provide an opening for quasi-self-employment. Rules on the award of public contracts that stipulate quality standards must remain in full force.

 Mr President, our adoption today of the regulation on driving and rest times will without doubt be a step forward in that the daily minimum will be increased, the maximum permitted driving time reduced, the digital tachograph introduced with the intention that manipulations be prevented and it be made possible to check the past 28 days, and, not least, the length of the journey – in terms both of distance and the time taken on it – to the place of assignment will now be counted as working time. All these things count as progress, and that is to the credit not least of our rapporteur, Mr Markov, who, right up to the very end of the process, has endeavoured splendidly to represent this House’s views, and it is for that reason that most of my group will be voting in favour. It has to be said, though, that there is one serious reason why I shall not be voting in favour of the conciliation result, and that is the Council’s refusal to allow it to be coupled with the Working Time Directive. Despite many offers of compromise on the part of Parliament, the Council has not found it possible to make concessions on this front. The driver’s working time does, however, include all his other duties, such as loading and unloading, repairs, filling in forms, all of which are tiring and therefore have a direct effect on safety on the road. It is for that reason that compliance with the working time directive must be monitored as well as driving and rest times checked up on. That is why it has to be possible for offences against the working time directive to be prosecuted and to incur sanctions. The Council was not able to do that, and it also owes us an explanation for that. It took a week for the reason for the Council’s refusal to become clear, when it turned out that ten Member States have not, to date, transposed the Working Time Directive at all, even though the deadline for them to do so expired in March 2005. The ten Member States in question are Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. It is no wonder that the Council refused to allow it to be coupled with another piece of legislation. I wish the Commission had supplied us with this information earlier on in these proceedings, for then, I believe, the fact that this directive had not even been transposed in ten Member States might well have caused our debate on this subject to take a slightly different course. Driving and resting times, working time and monitoring belong together. The Council has chosen to stand in the way of that, and that is why, today, this result gets a ‘no’ vote from me.

 Mr President, perhaps I might say, before I say anything else, that the behaviour indulged in by some of the dockers yesterday here in Strasbourg goes far beyond what is tolerable or permissible in political life. By all means protest and demonstrate, but violence and vandalism are out – they cannot be allowed and must be denounced. (Applause)
 Let me now turn to the matter in hand. In the past, we talked about clean waters and clean ports and campaigned for them. We enacted legislation on the subject, one example being the November 2000 directive on port waste facilities. If the port package belongs anywhere, that is where it belongs, in amongst the port’s waste; that is the right place for it. That being so, Social Democrats and many others will, tomorrow, reject this ‘port package II’ directive. Why is this so? The answer is quite simple. The Commission’s draft takes no account whatever of the realities of life in most of Europe’s ports; its intention of interfering in functioning, economically successful structures and using an enormous and expensive bureaucracy to impose on ports a competition that already exists in almost all of them, is intolerable. At the end of the day, the most important thing is that what is at stake is a lot of skilled jobs; families and livelihoods are at risk, and that is what this is all about. I have not, so far, heard a single reason to justify putting these jobs at risk and needlessly jeopardising social harmony in Europe’s ports. There is no reason to do so. We are told that the fundamental freedoms – which are constantly invoked – are not guaranteed in ports. There may be a few ports like that in Europe, but unremitting competition is a fact of life in most of them. It is only natural that there is limited space in most ports for those who want to provide port services, and by no means will every one of them get their chance at once, but that is far from saying that any one of them is discriminated against. Let me give, as an example, a pedestrian area in the smartest part of a city. Not everyone gets the chance to practise his profession there either, but does the Commission want to do something like stipulate a tendering process in future, simply because a German hairdresser is unable to rent a salon on the Ramblas in Barcelona just when he chooses to? That is simply not on. This is not just about Europe as a location for maritime business but also about how we Europeans measure up against the other continents. If we want to maintain our European social model, we cannot go presenting Asian businesses with European ports on a silver platter – and, by the way, our European ports are in any case much more efficient than Asian ones these days. You, Commissioner, inherited this questionable package from your predecessor, Mrs de Palacio. Knowing that you are not the sort to go hunting for legacies, we suggest that you rid yourself of this one – we will help you do it. The sort of proposal we want from you is one that cannot, in essence, be seen as anything other than European. What is needed is a European policy on ports, and fair competition between them, along with a proper policy on the ports’ hinterlands. We have to get European ports to compete properly with the rest of the world. If that is the sort of policy you want, Commissioner, then we are right behind you and will gladly work together with you in producing one. (Applause)

 Madam President, we shall not, of course, be following Mr Bradbourn’s suggestion. I am pleased that you, a skilled environmental politician, are present to see us make good progress with a European sustainable transport policy by adopting the infrastructure costs directive. Of course, we have not yet reached the end of the road; we are a long way from achieving our objective. The fact that we have come as far as we have, however, is due in large part to my colleague Mrs Wortmann-Kool. Therefore, I offer her my compliments and my sincere thanks. I should like to discuss two important points. We are discussing freight transport, and we cannot restrict ourselves to lorries weighing 40, 12 or 7.5 tonnes or more here, but want vehicles weighing 3.5 tonnes or more to be subject to tolls. It is then up to the Member States, too, to meet their responsibilities. In addition, we know that the costs of freight transport far exceed those of just constructing and repairing roads. The external costs for users must be calculated at long last, therefore, and can no longer be dressed up. It is quite possible to calculate these external environmental, noise, congestion and health costs, even if my colleague Mr Bradbourn takes a different view. According to a study, transport by road incurs external costs of EUR 88 per thousand tonne-kilometres, whereas the figures for transport by rail and inland waterway are EUR 19 and EUR 17, respectively. According to very conservative estimates, external costs make up at least 60% of infrastructure costs. The compromise envisages that we meet again in two years’ time. Therefore, the compromise entails a very great responsibility and obligation for the Commissioner. That is, we are expecting to see not only the model, but also legislative proposals in two years’ time, and I can already anticipate the quarters from which he will have to fend off the arrows. We shall hear arguments along the lines that this is not serious, is scientifically untenable and, if need be, puts jobs at risk. That is why I ask the Commissioner to make courageous proposals. The vast majority in Parliament will support you in this. (Applause)

 Mr President, I think that, when it comes to the transport sector, this Parliament has a good tradition of boosting rail transport and thus the rail sector. The Committee has borne this in mind, and it is likely, therefore, that we shall join together in plenary tomorrow to adopt, by a large majority, all the reports relating to the rail sector. I am obliged to all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, therefore, for their work, which evidently did produce a consensus in the end. No sooner had I had a discussion in my group than the railway package reappeared, in very abridged form, as the Jarzembowski report. I had to take issue with that, because there is of course a bit more to this railway package. In my opinion, the Savary report is very important. We need to have well-trained train drivers for cross-border transport in Europe, so that freight is transported well and safely by train drivers with well-qualified staff on board, who should also have proper social security cover. For this reason, I believe that the Savary report regarding freight transport is an important step forward. I think that the Sterckx report is also important, in that passengers’ rights, too, are being properly regulated in Europe at last, and in that the customers – the passengers – are to be entitled to reasonable compensation, as is the case with other modes of transport, in the event of delays for which the operator is to blame. With regard to the Zīle report, I must say that the Commission sometimes goes too far. As Mr Zīle has pointed out, he has done a very good job; yet the majority of the Committee – myself included – had reservations. On the subject of the quality requirements for freight transport, I must say that we have to start depending on the market before the market is capable of regulating anything. What is critical, in my view, is that we boost the rail sector. It was one of the Commissioner’s predecessors, Commissioner Kinnock, who coined the slogan about the revitalisation of Europe’s railways. Mr Kinnock (‘Old’ Labour rather than ‘New Labour’) was right with his ‘roadmap’, because our problem is that the volume of both freight and passenger transport by rail has been decreasing progressively since the 1970s. As the energy situation is now extremely critical, and we know that the transport sector is the greatest energy consumer of all, we have to take the opportunity to encourage a shift away from the roads and, increasingly, from flying – we keep coming back to the kerosene tax – in favour of the railways. Therefore, the railways must have a cross-border structure for both freight and passenger transport. This must not fall at the hurdle of former public officials with – sometimes sacrosanct – government property; instead, the way must be cleared for a rational new policy. This is our first reading. We all know that, sooner or later, a common position will be forthcoming, and there will be a second reading. We shall all meet again then. That being the case, we do not need to get so worked up. I do think, however, that we shall, together, be adopting a sensible measure tomorrow.

 Madam President, it would be true to say that August 2005 was a black month for civil aviation, and it is a good thing that we are again giving our attention to air safety. The Member who has not been following the debate has to be told that – as the Commissioner said – Europe is not reinventing the wheel. It has to be said that the Commission presented us with the regulation under discussion even before the accidents. It is evident, though, that it is only the one speech that interests him; the matter in hand is of secondary importance. We have to work towards guaranteeing the citizens of the EU, and the air passengers among them in particular, safety in every conceivable respect. To put it the other way round, that means that there is no room in European airspace for airlines that do not take safety seriously. That is why it is important that we should, while addressing this regulation on airlines with the utmost seriousness, pass it into law as quickly as possible. The rapporteur has explained it. The proposals are excellent, and, if we combine our efforts, we really can get it over and done with very quickly – at first reading, indeed. We have established the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is meant to guarantee a high standard of safety, but must also be given authority over aircraft from third countries. We will of course need a list of the black sheep, a blacklist – and not 25 lists, but one single list with standard criteria. I already have one for it. Last week, a pilot with the company FlyAir took a defective aircraft back to Paris-Orly airport, but, instead of giving him credit for this, the airline gave him the sack. That means that we already have one candidate for the blacklist, and I hope that the Commission will do something about this. To the Commissioner, I would say that he and his fellow-Commissioners should, in their deliberations, also consider the idea that, not least from the point of view of safety, the bargain airlines might perhaps be tackled a little harder than they have been in the past. Apart from that, we are side by side on what is very much the right road.

 Mr President, the trans-European networks present us with a glaring discrepancy between their general importance, which Mr Schmit has just underlined, and the extent to which they have been realised. It is for this reason that we are running the risk, where the trans-European networks are concerned, of making permanent the trans-European nuisance that we have had for some years now. Let me remind you that building the trans-European networks is a task given us by the Treaty of Maastricht. They are not something that we simply came up with; they are a matter of obligation, an obligation into which we jointly entered. Throughout the time that I have been working on them – starting with the Christopherson group, and most recently in the high-level representatives’ group under Karel Van Miert – the outcome has always been a great deal of hot air, but little of any real substance, and little in the way of projects. Even in the days of the Christophersen group, we were told that the projects were all ready to go ahead, that they were a practical proposition, and that the excavators could start work tomorrow. Not much actually happened, though. I would also like to remind you that last year, in May 2004, the Council and this House specified completion dates for the projects. If it turns out that these completion dates cannot be met, I would hope that the Council – and by that I mean not the Council as a whole, but the Member States – will say that that is not what they want, that they cannot go along with it, and that the projects cannot be completed. It is at that point that we will have to abandon the projects. So, in this matter, let us have more courage, more commitment and more honesty from the Council, and if what we have heard today – that the presidency, Parliament, and the Commission endorse the budget appropriations for the Financial Perspective – is a promise, then that is a statement with which we are very comfortable.

 Madam President, I am glad that you, a lover of the coastline, are in charge of this sitting, and you know that. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done in tandem with the shadow rapporteurs. I think we have here a sensible compromise ready for tomorrow’s vote, one that all the groups can support, and that will bring this matter to a close. The world is not, alas, the way we would like it to be. There have been terrorist attacks, which endanger the transport of persons and goods. Something must be done about them, and that is what this directive attempts to do; the upshot is that we have to take preventive action. One point that has to be made in this context, though, is that responsibility for security cannot, ultimately, be passed on to the ports alone; this is, on the contrary, a task for all those involved in transport, and that is something we must not forget. Security begins with the person loading on the goods, and it must, ultimately, involve both road and rail, or else we will end up with distortions of competition and with something else that we do not want, in the shape of more traffic on the roads rather than on water. This, I think, has to be taken into account. Unless I am mistaken, the Commission has already started giving consideration as to how this aspect may be included.

 Mr President, I wish to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Markov, who has already led us through the negotiations in a very constructive way. It is, actually, all very straightforward, Commissioner: drivers who have had a good night’s sleep are very good for safety on the roads, whilst exhausted drivers are a safety risk, or, to put it very simply, excessive tiredness is fatal. It is, then, for the sake of the drivers, of road safety and of competitiveness that we need proper driving times and rest periods that are capable of being monitored. Otherwise, the whole thing makes no sense. We are agreed, then, that we need rest periods totalling 12 hours a day, of which 9 are to be taken in one go. It must be possible to check records covering the past 28 days in roadside checks. In any one week, drivers must not spend more than 56 hours at the wheel, and in a fortnight, they must stop after 90. We also need a realistic date for digital tachographs. The Regulation must also include a new category covering light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Let me add, Commissioner, that we are not talking here about the delivery of pizzas, for a pizza, if it is transported – as the Committee on Transport and Tourism has suggested – for over 60 kilometres, will be cold and inedible! So we are not talking here about pizza delivery drivers, but about light commercial vehicles, which, at present, are allowed to do anything they like, including travelling at extremely high speeds, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, with no ban on driving on Sundays or at night, and without being checked up on – the consequence of which is an increasing number of accidents. The only figures I can quote are the German ones: between 1991 and 2001, accidents involving small vans and resulting in personal injury rose by 103%. In Germany in 2001, accidents caused by the drivers of small vans resulted in the deaths of 206 road users (an increase of 44% over 1991), serious injury to 2 548 road users (an increase of 66%) and minor injuries to 13 939. Figures provided by the road traffic police seem to indicate over-tiredness as one of the most frequent causes of such accidents, as a relatively large number of accidents involving light commercial vehicles happen in the evening or at night. The Council must stop pleading ignorance of the problem, come back down to earth and face reality. Let me repeat that this is not about the 60-kilometre radius, or about the post and service industries. Good rules and regulations are needed to deal with this problem. If it is accepted, in principle, that over-tiredness kills and injures, then responsible rules are needed. That is what the Committee wanted, and I hope that the Commission will, sooner or later, be able to come round to its way of thinking.

Madam President, I am pleased that you are chairing this sitting, because I know that you are a very careful and safe driver and that you are greatly interested in the whole question of road safety. It is a regrettable fact that skulduggery, cheating and forgery take place in the EU in connection with driving licences. These activities are made easier by the 110 different licence models that are currently in use in the European Union, and let us be honest: we need look no further for an example than Germany, where many drivers still have the collector’s item we call the grey rag; some of these have even paid the occasional visit to a washing machine. The limp grey card with its youthful photograph may be a cherished memento in the eyes of its owner, but it is certainly an inadequate form of identification for roadside checks. As you know, I started my working life as a police officer; what is a poor policeman in Palermo, Bordeaux or Madrid to do when he stops a vehicle and is shown a tatty piece of scrap paper that is no longer of any use to anyone? If we expect young people to be issued with a plastic-card driving licence today, it is absolutely reasonable to expect other people to exchange their droopy old paper documents within the lengthy transition period that the rapporteur’s very sound proposal prescribes. Let me say to Mr Jarzembowski that to call this compulsory exchange Zwangsumtausch
 in German is a very emotive thing to do, for the term is associated with the dictatorial regime in the German Democratic Republic, which compelled visitors entering the country to exchange deutschmarks for East German currency. We have to mind our terminology when we discuss European rules; a little care will keep the communication process on an objective level. As I said, the rapporteur has presented a very good proposal, and for that I thank him. My final point has already been mentioned. We must put an end once and for all to driving-licence tourism. If a person has his or her licence withdrawn in Germany today and does not pass the subsequent medical and psychological test, known colloquially in Germany as the idiots’ test, that person can go to the Czech Republic or elsewhere and obtain a new driving licence at little cost by pulling a residence trick. This situation cannot go on indefinitely here in Europe. We want to put an end to it with this directive, which is why I hope that, in tomorrow’s vote, Mr Grosch will be given a large majority, including the backing of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all due respect, environmental pollution does happen, one way or the other. The rapporteur has pointed out that we behave in a rather schizoid manner, because whenever there are environmental disasters we are all appalled; this turns to outrage, and the media come running. But the daily – and I repeat daily – pollution scandal in European and international waters seems not to attract widespread public attention. The figures speak for themselves. The Commission proposal referred at the time to 390 illegal oil discharges in the Baltic in the year 2001 alone and 596 illegal discharges in the North Sea. The environmental organisation Oceania estimates that there are three thousand illegal discharges a year in European waters. This is three thousand too many! Discharging pollutants must no longer be treated as a minor infringement; it is high time that it was made a criminal offence, with those who commit it being prosecuted and receiving stiff penalties. Investigation and prosecution depend on the availability of appropriate instruments. As has been said, the Member States do, of course, have their responsibilities, but in the longer term we shall need an efficient European coastguard. We shall not have it today or in the immediate future, but I believe it must come in the medium term. The prosecution and sentencing of marine polluters must not be thwarted by nations jealously guarding their rights of jurisdiction. Tomorrow, Parliament, the Council and the Commission will decide on a reasonably fair compromise, and the rapporteur can claim a great deal of the credit for its coming to pass. I should like to congratulate her and thank her for a very, very good piece of work, which has ensured that we are able to discuss this today and complete the process tomorrow, in other words that we do not need to activate the conciliation procedure but can proceed straight to adoption. It its framework agreement, the Council undertakes to impose severe penalties for criminal marine pollution: fines, imprisonment and prohibition of economic activity. The Commission and the Council intend to pursue the matter in the IMO. It defies comprehension, for example, that shipowners can still insure themselves against fines for marine pollution. Such rules need to be amended in the IMO framework. By agreeing to a feasibility study, we shall be taking an important first step towards a European coastguard. I will also, therefore, compliment the presidency on its fruitful cooperation with us on this issue. Luxembourg does not readily spring to mind when you think of countries with long coastlines, but at least it does have a very large fleet, which also imposes responsibility on this presidency, to which my thanks are also due. I believe all of us bear a great deal of responsibility for the natural world, including the seas and oceans. This is why tomorrow’s decisions must be very quickly implemented. Our coasts, our seas and our marine life will thank us for it.

 Mr President, I think that the time before the ICAO meeting at the end of September is the perfect moment for the European Parliament to speak its mind on the subject and for us – my dear Mr Schmitt – to discuss it. That the issue of air travel and the environment is a sensitive one is something we have noticed from the reactions of some airlines, but what is it all about? We know that air travel and global warming are connected; there is no argument about that. We are now talking in terms of the possibility of emissions trading, and the studies carried out to date have got us no further. That makes it absolutely necessary to keep all the options open when it comes to reducing emissions, and to do so using instruments that are both environmental and based on the market. What matters, then, is that neither the USA nor anyone else, at the meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal at the end of this month, should slam any doors shut. After all, we are not talking about introducing emissions trading today or in the next couple of weeks, but about the future possibility of the EU opting to facilitate this in air transport, using market-based emissions trading instruments; it is this position that the EU should keep open for itself. That, Commissioner, is why most of us in this House wholeheartedly support the Commission’s view that, as you have said, the EU should present as united a front as possible within the framework of the ICAO. I see it as both right and necessary that this House should underline this once again, so that no doors are slammed shut in the ICAO at the end of this month. The USA, too, must come to understand that the EU takes something of a different approach to the environment and air transport.

 Mr President, although I do not want to drag matters out, there is something remarkable about a ship being held somewhere for four years, a ship that has already been the subject of 18 proceedings for transporting prohibited materials, and one that is over 35 years old. The effect of the Prestige, 
over recent years, has been some small progress in lawmaking, and if the Member States were to be more prompt in processing the Commission’s proposals, we might well make some progress as regards pollution of the environment and criminal law. It is not the Commission that is dragging its feet, but the Member States. Even though we are seeing a changeover to a new Commission and will not be able to sort this out this evening, let me ask, Commissioner, that the Commission should respond to this calamity by producing a proper report with good analysis of both the environmental and transport aspects; then it might put forward some proposals for legislation, perhaps as part of the Erika III 
package. Then we will be able to use European law to close the loopholes whose presence this calamity has made so obvious, or, where there is negligence or a lack of vigilance, we will know who is responsible. It will enable the imposition of sanctions for sloppy work. I think it would be possible to do this over the next few months, so that we not merely learn from this catastrophe, but also make our seas rather safer in future than they have been in the past.
