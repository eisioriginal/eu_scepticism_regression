 Mr President, those of us in Parliament, and in European society, who want a political Europe and who welcome the new Member States, those who want a Constitution that will take the EU forward as a political entity that is united in its diversity are in the vast majority. Let us learn from this historic experience, which is unique in the world today, on a continent that, as recently as last century, suffered unspeakably tragic events. Stateless nations, such as mine, Galicia, are still not recognised as such in the draft Constitution. Given that what we want is a political Europe, a Europe of the peoples and the citizens, we shall continue to struggle for such recognition and for self-determination within the EU. Whilst we want a political Europe, Mr President, it must be said that this will not exist without a social Europe, which must be made a reality as a matter of urgency, by integrating our fellow peoples that have a per capita income of less than 40% of that in the Union of the Fifteen. Against this backdrop, it is paradoxical and irresponsible that the richest States, which claim that they want a political Europe, are attempting to impose a reduced European Union budget as low as 1% of Gross National Income. This is despite the fact that, with enlargement, the number of inhabitants of regions eligible for Objective 1 (whose income is less than 75% of the average per capita) is set to double; to put it more clearly, this figure is set to jump from 63 million people at present to 153 million in the coming years. Similarly, nothing will be resolved if the budget is limited to the 1.14% proposed by the Commission. If we continue this way, we will not be moving towards a social Europe. Funding per capita for Objective 1 regions will be halved, thereby blocking a cohesion policy that has benefited and defined the entire Union. This will have a negative effect on both the Union of the Fifteen and on the enlarged Union of Twenty-Seven.

 Mr President, the Sterckx report is a positive one, for which special thanks are due to the rapporteur. For this reason, we voted for it in committee. It is still not what we wanted, however, and we therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled will be adopted. The report should be firmer and more unequivocal in condemning the behaviour and the culpable omissions of the Spanish Government and the Galician authorities with regard to the Prestige
 disaster, and also in criticising the lack of European Union institutional, technical and economic resources for avoiding and responding to accidents at sea. The report should highlight the indifference and the neglect displayed by the Commission and by many Member States in the face of calls for effective measures to improve safety at sea and to help countries affected by disasters. It should also call, as a matter of urgency, for the International Maritime Organisation to recognise the culpability of the institutional system and of those capitalist companies – which I would brand as guilty – which govern maritime traffic, as well as demanding the measures needed to protect both life and maritime and coastal resources. In any case, given the temptation for those with vested interests to forget the disaster, we need to stress that the Prestige
 is not a historical issue, but that it can teach us lessons for the future, especially for Galicia, which of all the countries in the world has suffered the greatest number of such accidents over the last thirty years. The reaction of civil society in Galicia meant that the disaster became a political issue there, and for the European Union also, giving rise to a democratic movement that was intensified by the democratic struggle for peace and against the war in Iraq. This set in train the events that led to a democratic change of government in Spain, which was of momentous importance for everyone, including the European Union. I remember the date very well: it was 13 November, the day on which my third grandson was born. Nevertheless, the threat of accidents like the Prestige
 disaster is still hanging over us. This is very much the time for the European Union to spell out its willingness to make good the impact of a disaster which affected 2 000 kilometres of our coastline, from the Minho to Brittany. There is a particular need to support and strengthen the Galicia Plan, which is an undertaking on the part of the state to remedy the consequences of the disaster, an undertaking which the European Union and the new Spanish Government must fulfil without prevaricating, and which they must treat as an urgent priority.

 Mr President, I wish to use the short time available to me to express my surprise and dismay at the lack of interest and the contempt shown in the debates in this Parliament to the harsh reality that, in a Union of twenty-five States, cohesion policy will lose its character. It will be drastically impoverished. Indeed, following enlargement and if the financial perspective imposed by the Council for the period after 2006 remains in place and even if the financial perspective submitted by the Commission is implemented, the funds earmarked for education policy per capita in objective 1 territories will be only 50% of those applied in the Union of Fifteen. I would recall that, with the enlargement to ten new States, the population living in territories with a per capita income of less than ...% of the Community average, will rise from the current 73 million people, or 19%, to 153 million people, or 32%, of the Union of twenty-seven Member States. This round of enlargement will increase the population by 28% whilst GDP will increase by only 6%. For those of us who believe in the need for a Social Europe, and for me, as a Galician, this is totally unacceptable – all the more so because income in the enlargement countries stands at only 40% of the average income per inhabitant of the Fifteen and because in the current Member States there is still a clear need to maintain the Structural Funds levels of previous years.

 I wish first of all to offer my congratulations to the Irish Presidency on the way in which it has managed the issue of adopting the Convention’s Draft Constitution. As usually happens, it took the presidency of a small State to demonstrate the necessary intelligence and pro-European approach to attempt to solve such a significant problem. I say this despite the fact that, as a Member for a Stateless nation, Galicia, I must disagree with the constitutional text where this still fails to recognise Stateless nations, which are a fundamental part of Europe’s political, historical and cultural diversity. Having said this, I wish to focus on the section of the motion on the outcome of the Brussels European Council last week that deals with the terrorist attacks in Madrid. As I said in the amendment that I tabled through my group, I wish to express my admiration  admiration I know we all share  at the exemplary behaviour of the people of Madrid and of Spanish society as a whole following the terrorist attack that took place on 11 March. I must highlight the remarkable public-spirited and humanitarian way in which the citizens acted, the efficiency of the rescue services and the assistance given by all the institutions to the victims and their families and I would underline the fact that no xenophobic attitudes or attitudes rejecting any particular religion or country have been expressed.

 Mr President, I wish to express the sorrow that I feel, that we all felt, at the appalling devastation wrought by the Madrid terrorist attack and to express our sympathy and solidarity with the families of those murdered, and with the injured and their families. I should also like to express my profound admiration for the public-spirited and dignified behaviour of the people of Madrid, and for the extraordinary efficiency of all of the emergency services provided by institutions at state, autonomous community, city and municipality level. The maturity with which Spanish society has behaved, as in other communities afflicted by appalling man-made disasters, confirms Spain as a country that is rooted, both civically and democratically, in Europe. All of this took place without any xenophobic reactions or statements, and without any backlash against specific religions or countries. In light of everything that took place and the admirable behaviour of the people, it is essential that we adopt strong and democratic measures in the EU in the fight against terrorism. We must also, however, fight vigorously to prevent a militaristic polarisation of views and an ideology that is simply anti-terrorist from taking root in Europe and we must fight to ensure that our societies are never ruled by such ideology.

 Your words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and those of the Vice-President of the Commission lead me to believe that Ireland feels able to conclude an agreement on the Constitution put forward by the Convention. We will be delighted if Ireland is able to achieve this, not only because Ireland is a Celtic country like my own, Galicia, but also because this would show, once again, that it is one of the Union’s great pro-European countries. As a Member for one of Europe’s stateless nations, and one that is not even recognised as such, I have reservations about this draft Constitution arising from the shortcomings in cohesion policy and from the weakness of the positions we have adopted on our role in preserving peace in the world. I have confidence, however, in the direction the European Union has taken historically, which is unequivocally in favour of diversity with solidarity, in contrast with the uniform approach of the Jacobin States that today prevails in the State of which I am a citizen. It would be most opportune, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if this Parliament issued a formal statement under the Irish Presidency, approving the Constitution.

 Commissioner, I was aware, as you would expect, of your visit to Vigo, my birthplace, and I know that the city’s fishing sector, one of the largest in Galicia, in the Spanish State and in Europe, has just issued a set of suggestions concerning the duties and competences of this Agency, which I believe deserve a concrete answer from you. Furthermore, I believe that you should promote an open dialogue with the sector before defining the Agency’s regulations and I believe that this institution could provide the much-needed link between those working in the industry and the scientific institutions. In any event, I wish to ask you expressly whether the Commission has already received the proposal from the Spanish State to ensure that the Agency’s headquarters are established in Vigo and when you think it will be definitively established there.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there are those who call into question the Constitution that extends Parliament’s powers to approve legislative procedures by codecision. This is not a good time, therefore, to overlook Parliament’s power to approve, in conjunction with the Council, the vital question of the Trans-European transport networks. I therefore request, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that this crucial issue should be put before Parliament for consideration. In any event, as a Member of this House, I should like to bring to your attention today high-speed train projects in Galicia, in Portugal, in the North-east of the peninsula and in Aquitaine; in other words, a highly significant stretch of the EU’s Atlantic seaboard. I refer to the projects linking Oporto, Vigo and El Ferrol; Santiago de Compostela, La Coruña, Vigo, Orense, Valladolid and Aquitaine; and El Ferrol and Bilbao. All of these are contained in plans drawn up by the Portuguese and Spanish Governments, in this case the Galicia plan. We want this project to come to fruition and to be approved in the proper manner by codecision.

 Mr President, between some people’s euro-scepticism, some people’s arrogance and the stubbornness of others, the governments of the Member States and their leaders are endangering the adoption of the Constitution that the peoples and the citizens want and need. Their fight solely over the right of veto not only caused the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference to fail, which is what happened three years ago at Nice, but also managed to obscure the positive aspects and the shortcomings of the draft Constitution, stifling real debate in European society and in our various States and Nations. These factors have obscured the extraordinary value of the existence of the Constitution, the progress made in external policy since the crisis in Iraq, the leading role given to Parliament and consequently to the citizens, and the shortcomings of our policy for social and territorial cohesion, the failure to recognise national political diversity in Europe as well as in the Member States, which I wish to highlight as a Member of the European Parliament for Galicia and as Chairman of the Intergroup on Stateless Nations. Mr President, I wish to make it quite clear, since most of us are citizens of the Spanish State - that we are not judging the Constitution on the basis of our State Government’s potential power of veto and that we do not share the stubbornness of the current Prime Minister, José Maria Aznar, who distinguishes himself now and then by his talent for making enemies and by obstructing the solution to all problems. There are many more of us who wish political and social union to progress, united in diversity.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the Union, as a political entity, must give effective and universal joint commitments on issues as serious as Iraq, which we all hope will be resolved as soon as possible, especially when, despite the capture of Saddam Hussein, we face the near certainty of daily carnage and a drawn-out conflict, in addition to an extremely serious political problem of territorial, ethnic, religious and social integration that cannot be resolved simply by placing on the table naïve demonstrations of goodwill. Apart from the positive measures that the European Union has adopted, will the Council speak with a single voice in the quest for peace and solidarity in its talks with the UN, the United States, and with the states in the region? Or will the Union remain paralysed, as it is today, in the face of this tragedy? To conclude, does the President-in-Office of the Council really believe that all resistance in Iraq is simply terrorist activity, as he has just stated?

 Mr President, as a citizen of the Spanish state, I wish to tell this Parliament that the views of the majority of my fellow citizens are by no means represented by the positions that the Spanish Prime Minister, José Maria Aznar, is trying to impose. These call for the implementation of the voting system set out in Nice –
 precisely the opposite of the one approved by the Commission, which involves a double majority of States and citizens. In his attempt to keep this arbitrary power of veto, which was won at serious cost to the Spanish representation in this Parliament, Mr Aznar will be representing himself alone and will be confirming his status as the most unhelpful and intransigent political leader in Europe. José Maria Aznar is trying fraudulently to hijack the draft European Constitution to block the progress of the national governments of Galicia, the Basque Country and Catalonia in the context of a multinational State, attempting to have things included in the draft that, if accepted, would prevent the future reunification of Ireland, because it would change the borders of the United Kingdom and of Ireland and would also prevent Gibraltar being handed back to the Spanish State. I will conclude by recalling that yesterday fifteen more immigrants perished off the coasts of the Spanish State and I believe that we should bear this fact in mind in order to implement the political measures necessary to prevent any repetition of such events.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to take this opportunity provided by the Rules of Procedure to ask precisely the questions that I tabled previously. What is the Commission’s position on the requests made by the occupying powers in Iraq and on the serious situation Iraqi society is now experiencing? What measures does it consider should be adopted to support the UN’s action in Iraq?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (PT)
 Mr President, allow me to say first of all that, as a citizen of the Spanish State, I am utterly opposed to all the positions adopted by José María Aznar during the voting in the Council. Secondly, allow me to mention three concrete problems. Solving them would help improve the text of the draft Constitution, emphasising important aspects of the Union’s political, cultural and institutional nature, without altering the basic orientation of the Convention’s work. The first problem is the need explicitly to reinstate the actual circumstances of our peoples into the definition of the Union, defining it as a union of states, peoples and citizens. At the end of the draft text, the destiny and well-being of the peoples of Europe are mentioned as objectives of the European Union. The second problem is recognition in the Constitution of the existence within the Union of constitutional nationalities, federated states, and so on, with executive and legislative powers: state powers, in fact. The third problem is to affirm clearly and precisely that the Union is a social union. In any case, I hope that the Constitution of the Union will some day come to recognise the stateless nations of Europe, such as Galicia, Scotland and others, so that they are not forced to fight in order to lay claim to their own states, that being the only practical way for them to be represented as nations in the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, along with the entire communications infrastructure and the media, the rail network is crucial to turning the European Union into a political entity without frontiers. This is as much the case now as it has been in the development of modern states over the last 200 years. These services are needed for economic progress and modernisation, just as the measure of extending the high speed network is also required, at present, in order to dynamise and revitalise productive activity. The rail package, therefore, is not simply a new tool enabling private companies to do business as quickly as possible, but is rather a tool for building the road to political, economic and social integration throughout the Union. My group rejects Mr Jarzembowski’s report, since his approach runs counter to the one outlined above, but will vote in favour of the Sterckx report on safety, the Ainardi report on interoperability, and the Savary report on the European Railway Agency, which are compatible with it. For me, as a Galician, and for all inhabitants of nations located far from the geographical centre of Europe, these European Parliament decisions should, of course, be a way for us to gain access to high-speed communication with the whole of Europe. The plan for investment in infrastructure currently being developed by the Commission should share this aim, bearing in mind above all the fact that railways are kinder to nature and also more favourable to social welfare than any other transport network.

 Mr President, a large number of prospective immigrants drowned recently in the waters off the coast of Sicily. When, I wonder, will the institutions of the European Union forego their callous and reprehensible indifference to tragic deaths such as these? Moreover, when, I wonder, will we ourselves, the Members of this Parliament, observe at least a minute’s silence for these poor souls who were looking for a better life in our countries?

Mr President, Commissioner, I must begin by saying that the democratic rebelliousness that has appeared in Galicia and other societies in Spain was truly extraordinary as proof of many people’s desire to ensure that disasters such as the one in Galicia do not happen again. The Nunca Máis
 movement, which incorporates seamen, volunteers and local authorities from Galicia, is genuinely an admirable response and I believe that the response from the rapporteur and from this Parliament to the Prestige
 problem is, for the time being, in line with this democratic rebelliousness. In this respect, we must remember that six very serious accidents occurred in Galicia in the last 30 years, that, in spite of this, no measures were taken, as they were after the Erika
 accident, and that, once again, there were no emergency plans and there are still no emergency plans. I must point out that if a vessel like the Prestige
 were to sail past Galicia now, exactly the same disaster would occur because there have been no changes that prevent these types of vessels from sailing in Community waters. The result of the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr President, is better than we could have hoped. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, and all those who have worked on this document which is better than hoped for, despite the obstacles encountered, by this Parliament as well as in Galicia and in the Spanish State. In any case, it is an important step forward in resolving the chaos surrounding international maritime transport. The document seriously criticises the behaviour of the Spanish authorities – which I believe is appropriate – and even more serious criticism is required of the chaos surrounding international maritime transport, the International Maritime Organisation, the states involved and the major companies, the international transport mafias. I believe that we must continue this work. To this end, our group and I, myself, approve of the amendments concerning the creation of a temporary committee to examine in detail the causes of this problem and resolve future problems. We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx. I would like to highlight a few issues: the Prestige
 problem has still not been resolved one year later. The fuel oil is still reaching the beaches. I am sorry to contradict the Commissioner, but oil is still reaching the Galician beaches – and particularly those in Cantábrico – and there are even very substantial layers of oil below the sand itself. We still do not know how much sludge is contained in the ship and the long-term consequences have by no means been resolved. Studies indicate that it will take 10 years to repair the damage and that investments of EUR 3 billion to EUR 5 billion will be required to remedy the situation. It is also essential to bring order to the chaos in international maritime traffic. In conclusion, I want to say that it is all too clear that there is a political conflict within the European Union itself. The Commission’s behaviour, which I have praised, is not always mirrored in many of the Member States, and in the European Parliament there are conflicting positions, some which are in favour of resolving this problem and some which are not. We need European legislation – like the legislation in the United States – as a condition for resolving the entire international maritime traffic situation. I think that it is fair to say here that the European Maritime Safety Agency must be situated in the country that was most affected by the disasters. It is also fair to say here that it is essential to resolve the situation of shipyards such as Astano in Galicia or Izar, which are prohibited from building civil vessels. Finally, we in Europe and the International Maritime Organisation must encourage changes to the entire international maritime legislation, creating what I would call a ‘Galicia Protocol’, similar to the Kyoto Protocol, to resolve the problems of the sea, which is the reserve of humanity.

 Mr President, I should like to open my speech by asking a question; is there a common fisheries policy, apart from the one that is used to uphold the privileges enjoyed by some countries and fleets? According to the draft constitution now before us, which will be going to the Intergovernmental Conference, there is not. In the third part of the common policies, in the section dealing with agriculture and fisheries, fish are called agricultural products, and no reference at all is made to the CFP. In a discussion of the Union’s seas and maritime resources, this is as surprising as it is Kafkaesque. It says nothing about the CFP, nothing about ensuring equal rights for all countries and fleets whilst, of course, preserving fish stocks for our children and grandchildren. For this reason, amongst others, I support the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the mid-term review of the 4th Fisheries Protocol with Greenland. I support the report precisely because it represents a step in the right direction, calling for the fishing countries, fleets and companies unfairly excluded both by the incorrect application of the principle of relative stability, and by the current protocol to be given the opportunity of fishing in Greenland’s waters. The rapporteur opens the way for the discussion which is necessary to improve the forthcoming protocols, whilst upholding, as one would expect, Greenland’s rights and its decision-making process.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the reality of the situation cannot be denied. We cannot turn our backs on the consequences of the Prestige
 disaster. Fuel oil is still washing up on the coasts of Galicia and in the Bay of Biscay; a week ago I saw this situation for myself, in the Rostro sandbanks at Cape Finisterre. The Prestige
 is still lying at the bottom of the sea. It is haemorrhaging fuel oil and we do not really know what it contains. Fishermen, scientists and Galician and Cantabrian society as a whole are all extremely concerned at the damage that has already taken place and crucially, at the uncertainty of what the future holds. Objective studies state that the final balance of the damage caused by the Prestige
 will exceed EUR three billion. Compare these sums, Commissioner, with those you have just mentioned, which are totally inadequate. I therefore put the question to you once again: is the Commission going to remain passive or is it going to take the bull by the horns once and for all and shoulder its responsibilities in order to solve this very real problem and to impose some order on the unregulated traffic that plies our seas?

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and in European society, there is a profound distrust of the Italian Presidency. Not because of Italy, of course, the foundation of our culture, of many of our languages and of the very idea of Europe, but because of the political personality of President Berlusconi. You, Mr Berlusconi, are one of the main representatives of the authoritarian right of our day, protagonist in the battle between the classes, internally and globally, between the rich and the poor and the workers. You even call people such as President Prodi, critical journalists and the judges who judge you ‘communists’. You use antiquated language, even troglodyte language, forgetting which century you are in. You are a friend of Sharon against Arafat. This distrust was ratified by certain key elements in your speech today. You subordinate the constitution of the European Union to relations with the United States. You are unaware of the chaotic and tragic situation in Iraq, caused by governments friendly to you. You forget the Prestige
 disaster, which was suffered principally by my nation, Galicia. You underplayed the constant deaths of immigrants, off both our coasts and in your island of Sicily. You said nothing about the social Europe, about social and territorial cohesion, not even in view of the prospect of enlargement. You did not expressly defend the draft constitution. In Italy, Mr President, you were granted immunity. Here, as President-in-Office of the Council, you will not have it.

 Commissioner, your speech took the words right out of my mouth, since I was actually going to say that Commissioner Lamy has always answered my questions fully. I am very grateful to you for that, as I am always grateful to you for your answers to my questions during Parliamentary Question Time. In any event, I would like to say, before asking one last question, that the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur have just returned from Brasilia. We held meetings with members of the Brazilian Government, with parliamentary leaders, with the President of Congress, and with President Lula’s principal advisors, and we realised once again that we are dealing here with an extraordinary country, which is setting in motion an exemplary social inclusion programme, which will be crucial to its future. As the Commissioner knows, this country also enjoys privileged economic relations with Europe, in addition to the traditional relations of cultural kinship. In addition, I myself have just spent a month and a half in Argentina, on political business, and have seen the progress that the country has made. Mercosur sees its connections with the European Union as a historical relationship between sister states, as a partnership which is essential in order to avoid subordination to the United States. That is why I ask whether the Commission is prepared to give special priority in future to its relations with Mercosur, and perhaps with the whole of South America, which may possibly join Mercosur.

In the last few weeks, hundreds of emigrants have suffered the same tragic fate off the coasts of southern Italy, Andalucia and the Canary Islands.

 Mr President, Presidents of the Commission and of the Council, I wish, first of all, to offer my congratulations to the Greek Presidency for the intelligent and useful work it has undertaken. We have once again seen proof that the presidencies of the European Union’s small- and medium-sized States are better and more pro-European than those of the larger countries. I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency in particular on the way it acted during the crisis triggered by the war in Iraq, launched by the United States and the United Kingdom and supported by the government of the Spanish State. The presidency did its best to achieve peace and to combat the idea that transatlantic relations must involve the subordination, and even the humiliation, of Europe by the United States, a prospect that is all the more dismal because that country is currently governed by the militaristic far right. Accordingly, we hope that the Convention presents the European Council with a draft Constitution that continues constructing a Union that is respected on the world stage as a body working for peace and solidarity, unlike the militarism that currently prevails. I hope that the Constitution will give this Parliament all the democratic powers that it needs, including codecision and a role in electing the president of the Commission. We are, therefore, in agreement with President Prodi’s ideas on the Council presidency. In any event, we must be able to have confidence in the future of the Union. Only recently, following the failure that was Nice, just one small group in this Parliament was calling for the Union to have a Constitution. As a European and as a political representative of a nation-state such as Galicia, of course I want the Constitution to respect the national and cultural diversity that constitutes the fabric of Europe. This is what we are calling for because Jacobin tendencies clearly still exist on our Continent. We must ask ourselves why Slovakia, Luxembourg, Estonia and Malta are recognised as European nations, but Galicia, Scotland and Catalonia are not. I shall make one final observation: I hope that the Union’s institutions are courageous enough to end the criminal chaos that dominates international maritime traffic and which leads to disasters such as that involving the Prestige
. We must prevent the appalling deaths, such as those that occurred the day before yesterday just off the Spanish coast, of illegal immigrants seeking work in Europe. We must ensure that joint policies such as the CAP and the CFP or cohesion policy are fair and non-discriminatory. We hope that this will happen, so that everyone can benefit.

Mr President, on the issue of fishing, there is a constant tendency in this Parliament to confuse privileges with conservation. I agree that there must be areas in which special conservation measures must be taken, and even that there must be no fishing in them for many years. But this conservation has nothing to do with the fact that in certain areas there are States who enjoy the privilege of fishing and others for whom it is banned. In this regard, the case of the Irish Box
 for example, or other areas in European Community waters, that is, continental waters, is not the same as the case of the Azores. In the Azores, the problem is that they do not have a continental shelf, and those islands must be granted a privilege so that they can survive by means of fishing. In the Irish Box
 or other areas, we are talking about a privilege granted to several States in violation of Community law. In this regard, this confusion has been exploited to achieve a vote whose result I believe to be profoundly wrong.

Mr President, I would ask you to grant me the minute of patience I require to explain my position in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. Today's agenda contains a question by Mr Sacrédeus – which I support – on the violation of human rights in Cuba. It is clear that taking measures to free the political prisoners in Cuba does not fall within the competence of the Council. That is clear, but this question has been allowed. However, I firstly presented a question on the deaths of protesters caused by US troops in Iraq – thirteen deaths in an Iraqi town – and I was told it contained value judgments. I amended the question, in order to remove the value judgments, and once again I am told that it is not admissible, because I asked whether the Council was concerned about the death of protesters, particularly in view of the fact that the US troops are supported by Member States of the European Union. I am wondering why a question on Iraq is not admissible but a question on Cuba is – although I consider that question to be legitimate since it is a universal issue. Mr President, it seems to me – because this is not the first time this has happened – that there is censorship on Iraq, which is unacceptable. In any event, I demand a reply, because I am finding it impossible to raise universal problems in this House which affect us directly. In any event, I would like to ask you to explain why this discrimination has taken place, Mr President.

 Mr President, in my capacity as a Member of this House I often take part in Question Time to the Commission and to the Council. I see these occasions as opportunities to express opinions and to call these two institutions of the European Union to account. Questions I tabled recently concerning the war in Iraq have regularly been rejected as unacceptable on the grounds that value judgments are involved. One of these questions related to how the Prime Minister of Spain, Mr Aznar, threatened Mexico and Chile with obstacles in their association with the European Union if those two countries failed to vote for the notorious second United Nations resolution. In no way was this a value judgment. It was simply a statement. Mr Aznar had made those threats. Nonetheless, the question was rejected. A question I tabled for this sitting was also rejected. The question concerned the 13 people shot dead by members of the United States forces during a demonstration in a town in Iraq. It appears that such issues are effectively being censored. The freedom of expression of Members of the House is therefore being limited, when we are simply striving for peace and justice. I wanted to draw attention to this situation because I believe the matter is not being dealt with impartially, and that the freedom of expression of Members of this House is being restricted. I will reiterate my views during Question Time to the Council tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to use my speaking time to call for a reform of the CAP that does not again overlook those regions of the Union that have climatic and environmental conditions and farming traditions that are particularly appropriate to multifunctional rural development. These are regions whose farming consists of small and medium-sized family holdings, based on land and pastures, regions that have considerable milk-producing capacity and which, because they did not have the necessary milk quota when they joined the Community, have undergone a Malthusian modernisation, which has led to the disappearance of tens of thousands of holdings. Today, these regions receive practically no production subsidies, which means that they would not receive decoupled aid either. They form part of States where there is an enormous deficit between milk consumption and production. I am talking about Galicia, but I am not only referring to my own country; I am talking about countries that need their milk quota to be increased, countries that could provide for their internal markets without calling European balances into question. I hope that these are not ignored once again in this reform of the CAP.

Mr President, I believe it is my duty to draw attention to the fact that, only today, 12 African migrants have disappeared, and must surely have died, while they were trying to reach the Spanish coast close to Africa, looking for work. Once again, I think that the European Union will have to take the necessary political steps, doing everything possible to avoid such frequent, terrible disasters.

 I personally endorse, as does my Group, the Commission’s aim in introducing this regulatory measure, which, in any event, we support. We have to say, however, that it has been a long time in coming, since we have already endured the Prestige 
disaster, which happened when the ship should no longer have been at sea according to the terms of the Commission’s initial proposals. The measure is overdue and falls well short of what is required. The Union should adopt political and legislative measures to ban single hull ships carrying dangerous goods such as petroleum derivatives from sailing anywhere in waters under European Union economic control, and not just ban such ships from entering Community ports and using Community anchorages, as the Regulation does. We would like, furthermore, to see ‘sensitive coastal areas’ defined in this Regulation, and entry to them restricted for oil tankers posing a particular risk. In any case, we must be aware – and the blame lies with certain Member States of the European Union and with this House – that, over and above the proposals for double hulls, which we support, there are no political and legislative measures either in place or envisaged capable of preventing a fresh disaster if a new Prestige 
case were to occur. We Galicians are vividly and painfully aware of this fact. After this Regulation, and even in spite of it, a new Prestige 
may once again sail off the shores of Galicia and other affected countries; there is no law to prevent it.

Mr President, we all knew that there was going to be a humanitarian disaster and that it was going to affect women and children especially, who make up the majority of the Iraqi population. We MEPs who were in Baghdad and Basra witnessed this in particular. The inspectors there told us – as did Mr Blix in the United Nations – that there were no weapons of mass destruction. I do not know what we are surprised about. But we were not aware of the immense irresponsibility of the occupiers. Chaos and the law of the jungle reign in Iraq and the citizens lack protection. And I would draw attention to the fact that the majority of the future occupiers are members of the European Union: the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Spanish State, while the European Union is absent. In this regard, Mr President, it seems to me ludicrous that Mr Poettering is still saying that we cannot create a European Union in opposition to the United States. Quite the contrary: the United States – the extreme right governing there – is working against the European Union as a body with a presence in the world. We are witnessing an unacceptable situation which this Parliament must condemn on behalf of the citizens of Europe who demonstrated against it. Mr President, we must call for the full restoration of United Nations law and we must point out once again that the ‘oil for food’ programme and the inspections are the sole responsibility of the United Nations. Otherwise, the established law will be broken, even with resolutions which the occupiers originally approved. In any event, I would like to say in particular today that I reject the position of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, who has become a servant of the extreme right currently governing the United States. He wants to turn the Spanish State into a new Puerto Rico. Particularly in view of the fact that this goes against the views of the majority of the Spanish people. Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all possible humanitarian assistance must be provided, of course; but above all, if this assistance is to be effective, the political presence of the European Union and the United Nations is needed.

 Mr President, the Spanish State has been notable for its support of the unilateral attack mounted by the United States and the United Kingdom against Iraq. Now, together with Italy and Poland, it is going to act as an occupying power in the Iraqi State. Does the Council believe that the Spanish State should consequently share international responsibility because of its warlike, illegal and unjust aggression? What kind of relationship will the European Union have in the action it undertakes in Iraq with the Member States occupying that country?

Mr President, I would like to add my voice to this complaint from my fellow Members. Several journalists died. One of them, who died yesterday, José Couso, is from my country, Galicia. Furthermore, I would like to point out that those of us who were members of this Parliament’s delegation which visited Iraq a month and a half ago, stayed in that very hotel, the Palestine hotel, and we are therefore very aware of the seriousness of this attack. But I would also like to point out, Mr President, that it is above all children who die in this war, something which we already knew. In yesterday's attack supposedly aimed at Saddam Hussein, seven children died in a restaurant. I believe it is now time for this Parliament also to observe a minute’s silence from time to time for these children, the innocent victims of this war.

 Mr President, I do not know whether you are aware that I have received a note from the Presidency concerning a question I asked the Council and which was due to be answered today, saying that it is unacceptable, because it apparently made accusations of bad faith or a procès d'intention
 with regard to words spoken by the President of the Spanish Government, Mr Aznar. As everyone knows, at a press conference with Mr Blair, Mr Aznar threatened Chile and Mexico by saying that, if they did not vote in favour of the coalition position in the Security Council, the progress of their agreements with the European Union could be blocked by some States. I do not think that this constitutes a threat; it is simply Mr Aznar’s true intention. This is why my question has not been allowed. Despite this, I have reworded it. Mr President, do you know whether I will be able to table the question today? In any event, Mr President, I wish to ask whether today’s questions have been looked at, to know whether any other accusations of bad faith have been made. Because there have been and they are all legitimate. I fail to understand on what grounds the President has decided to reject my question, because when I spoke about Mr Aznar, I did so objectively and clearly: this was Mr Aznar’s clear intention in threatening Chile and Mexico, countries which, furthermore, are Spanish-speaking, which makes the situation all the more unacceptable. I wish to ask, Mr President, whether you will allow me to ask this question and whether, in any event, the other questions have been looked at to see whether they are guilty of the same sin.

 Mr President, I am going to ask two very short supplementary questions. The first is this, and I am asking Mrs Wallström: what is the amount of and the timetable for the financing of the national hydrological plan by the European Union for 2000-2006? In the second, which also has to do with the environment and Spain, I ask what is the amount forecast by the Commission for the financing of the Galicia plan established by the Spanish Government to recover the Galician coastline and to develop Galicia after the Prestige
 accident, also for 2000-2006, bearing in mind that the Spanish Government considers that EUR 12 billion of global funding is needed over this period?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (PT)
 Mr President, Commissioner, the first part of my question is crucial; it is absolutely fundamental. Spain’s national hydrological plan absorbs a fundamental part of the Cohesion Fund for that Member State. The Commission’s attitude to this financing is decisive for Spain’s national hydrological plan to be taken forward or not. I believe the Commissioner is aware of this and she should have clarified and explained this decisive point.

Mr President, there is no need for me, or for any of the Spanish MEPs, to say we are against this type of practice and against all types of violence. But I must say, Mr President, that this is happening within a context in which millions of Spaniards are demonstrating against the war and in which the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar is comparing States such as France and Germany … (Protests)
 … with Saddam Hussein, in the Congress of Deputies. Just yesterday he described the States who are against the war as allies of China and Russia, rather than saying that this is a European position which is opposed to that of the United Kingdom and Spain. (Applause)

 Mr President, I should like first of all to recall the forgotten Iraqi victims, especially the young people, who have been the victims of a militaristic government, of an empire that is in decline rather than at its zenith. George Bush, the president of the United States Government, is himself the clearest indication of the crisis in that country. This Parliament must not fall in with the logic of war; it must call for the UN General Assembly to convene immediately in order to demand a cease-fire. As a Galician, and as a citizen of the Spanish State, I wish to speak out against Jose Maria Aznar, a prime minister who is disloyally calling the European Union into question. He is a prime minister who ridiculously believes himself to be a key player, together with Bush and Blair, in a new Yalta, this time held in the Azores. His attitude is ridiculous and paranoid. He is a prime minister who, one hundred years on, wants to turn the Spanish State into a new colony of the United States; into a new Puerto Rico.

 Mr President, I am one of a group of Members who have tabled questions to the Council. I can state that one question – which for me personally is extremely important – on the conflict that I believe exists between the Commission and the Council with regard to legislation on maritime traffic, tabled on 30 January, according to the document currently before us, is being answered much later than questions tabled in February. We naturally attempt to receive answers here in plenary and we fail to understand what criterion is used. Should we not be told the political criterion so that we can act accordingly?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as you know, following the 1989 accident involving the oil-tanker Exxon Valdez
, the United States proclaimed a law called the ‘Oil Pollution Act’, which sought to provide an effective remedy to this type of problem. To give an example, vessels sailing in US waters are required to provide a security of USD one billion and, in the event of an accident, a sum of USD five billion is required as indemnity. Only EUR 180 million have been set aside for clearing up the Prestige
 disaster, to be divided between Galicia (the most badly affected country, which is my country – my nation), other communities in the Spanish State and France. I believe that we need to draft a law similar to the US Oil Pollution Act, so that, through this European initiative, we can modify the legislation of the International Maritime Organisation. What is the Presidency’s view on this matter? What initiative does it intend to take? Why does it not establish compulsory rules for maritime traffic, such as those that exist for air and land traffic?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE
). 
 – (PT)
 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I agree with you when you state that the laws of the International Maritime Organisation must be changed. What we must do now, however, is seek an appropriate strategy with which to do this. We already have the US Oil Pollution Act, which is a step in the right direction. The best strategy for amending, for changing international legislation is to pass a specific European law. The rest will follow as an inevitable consequence. Why not give this a try? Could it perhaps be because some Member States such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Greece are opposed, as happened at the Copenhagen Council? We must bear in mind that there have been no accidents in the United States in the last fifteen years, but there have been in Galicia and in Brittany. There have been accidents in the European Union.

Mr President, I will recall the words of Mr Leinen by pointing out that, at this time, the majority of this Parliament is in favour of the President of the Commission being elected by Parliament, which represents a substantial advance, because two years ago the majority of Parliament voted against this initiative, and is also evidence of the progress the European political union is making. It is good to remember this at a time when there may be a humanitarian disaster in Iraq and when, for this reason, there is an attack by the United States with allies within the European Union, and allied with States which wish to join the European Union, against the idea of the existence of a political union present throughout the world. And I would draw this Parliament’s attention, since this is the place where the political notion of Europe must progress, to those who are attacking us by means of internal allies.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 – (PT)
 Mr President, I wish, first of all, to talk about something that is of concern to us all: the issue of war and peace, which was addressed in Davos and Porto Alegre. In Davos, it was discussed because of the effects of the economic situation of the war against Iraq that the United States and its allies have decided on. Without denying the disastrous effects on the world economy of the militaristic decisions of George Bush, what was at the heart of the proposals made in Porto Alegre against the war and in favour of peace were the serious political and humanitarian issues raised by the United States’ aggression. We have a situation in which ultraliberal capitalism, which can be seen as the domination of globalisation by the most powerful States and the huge multinational corporations, is leading the world towards disaster. Especially today, we are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster in Iraq, causing the death of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, amongst the poorest and most needy members of Iraqi society, especially young people, with the United States counting on the complicity and action of its European allies. Mr President, we must remember that the governments of the United States and of some Member States of the Union, against the beliefs and wishes of the majority of European citizens, are reaching the point where they are calling into question the model of European political integration that brings with it the awareness of another form of globalisation, which is more human and egalitarian and which demonstrates greater solidarity. The United States even want to destroy the idea of a constitutional political Europe with an independent role in the world. The other issue I wish to raise, Mr President, concerns international maritime traffic, the safety of our seas and of our coastal communities. The World Parliamentary Forum presented this problem as one of the main concerns of the ‘old world’ school of thought. The European Union must attach priority to resolving this problem, which today particularly affects Galicia and other European countries, from the Spanish State to France. The sea represents life itself. We cannot allow it to be owned and contaminated by a greedy, irresponsible and corrupt form of capitalism that enjoys the complicity of some European States. I therefore hope that the European States and this Parliament take the decisions that are needed to prevent the destruction of the sea that gives us life and sustains us.

Madam President, I agree with the report by my colleague and fellow countryman Rosa Miguélez Ramos. I agree with her when she says that fishing in international waters is crucial to the European Union, to the fisheries sector itself, but also to international policy and economic and social cooperation with other countries. The European Union’s real policy, however, is not in accordance with this view and nor is fishing in Community waters. The failed reform of the common fisheries policy highlighted this unfortunate situation. In this context, I have to say that my country, Galicia, is one of the major victims: in Community waters; we suffer (...) at the hands of certain countries and fleets, in international waters, we suffer from the contempt of the Commission and the Council as a result of this international policy. The Commission services even lack the necessary human, budgetary and material resources. Even fishing on the continental shelf and aquaculture are today, as always, seriously damaged, affected by disasters occurring on Galicia’s coasts, such as that of the Prestige
. This is a situation that must be resolved as a matter of urgency.

Mr President, I would like to point out that in the provisional Minutes for yesterday which have been distributed, it is recorded that I voted in favour of the final Resolution of the Napolitano report. This is a mistake. The final version should reflect the fact that I abstained on that report.

 Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has just called this problem a ‘natural disaster’. I should like to ask him why he attributes natural causes to a disaster that has clearly occurred as the result of political and therefore preventable reasons? A natural disaster is clearly something quite different. This is like calling a crash involving several cars or lorries on a motorway a natural disaster! It is other types of causes that need to be cleared up. I feel that the Greek Presidency is getting off to a bad start on this matter if it thinks that this is really a natural disaster. I would ask: why are you calling this a natural disaster, which I believe is a complete misnomer?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, society as a whole is currently convinced that international maritime traffic is the domain of a predatory form of capitalism that does not have the interests of society at heart and which is even criminal. Standards must be established to prevent this terrible situation continuing. There are various approaches to solving this problem: one is that adopted by the United States in the wake of the Exxon Valdez 
accident in 1989, by creating the Oil Pollution Act, in 1990. I would recall that the guarantee required of shipowners stands at USD one billion, that the liability required is unlimited and that, currently, Exxon Mobil is being asked to pay USD four billion in compensation. Double hulls, coastguards, etc, etc, form part of this approach. Another approach is that of the Erika
, a piece of legislation that, although a step forwards, is not being properly applied by the Council and the Member States, which prefer to move in the sphere of international mafias. On the other hand, there are countries, such as Galicia, which are suffering the consequences and whose populations, including fishermen and volunteers are having to fight the oil slick with their bare hands. I believe that the only solution is for the EU to create its own legislation (we could even call it the ‘Prestige’ law, imitating, in this case, the United States. Next, we should surely amend all international legislation. I wish to ask whether you will be adopting initiatives to achieve this?

 Mr President, I knew that Mr Méndez de Vigo was reactionary on issues of European diversity, but I did not know that he was so ignorant. To call the concept of a people archaic not only runs counter to the fundamental principles of our civilisation, it is also contrary to many constitutions, such as that of the United States of America, which starts with the precise phrase ‘We the people’. Mr Méndez de Vigo's statement conflicts with the constitution of the United States, and also with the views of his boss, José Maria Aznar. Mr President, we believe that the European Union is at present an historically unprecedented union of shared sovereignty, and the stateless nations, such as Galicia, want to make progress through their participation in these institutions, and are even working towards a kind of internal enlargement. What we ask is why Malta and not Galicia? Why Cyprus and not Scotland? Stateless nations very often have a history, a political will and a demography that justify this participation. Nevertheless, the Napolitano report was a step in the right direction, but it has to some extent been frustrated by the reactionary Jacobinism of people like Mr Aznar and Mr Méndez de Vigo, a Jacobinism that is now negated by the reality of the European Union itself.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, I too would like to speak today about enlargement, about the Convention, about Iraq and about the economic situation, but I do not have time. I certainly support what the chairman of my group has said. Before coming here, I asked the Greek Presidency if it would give priority to the issue of international maritime traffic in dangerous goods. I subsequently noted that the President-in-Office of the Council did in fact refer to this question. Maritime traffic is an important issue for Greece and it is to be expected that the Greek Prime Minister should give it priority. However, Mr President-in-Office, international maritime traffic has at present unfortunately fallen from grace and is associated with the situation in Galicia, the location of one of Europe's and the world's biggest disasters over the last 30 years. These names are all too familiar: ‘Andos Patria’, ‘Telepolicomander’, ‘Orquiola’, ‘Cason’ and ‘Prestige’. Mr President-in-Office, like those I have quoted many of the names are Greek and most of the shipowners were or are Greek. There seems to be no solution and no end to the ‘Prestige’ disaster: our coastline and sea have been contaminated and the wreck of the ‘Prestige’ on the seabed still represents a continuing threat. The actions of the Spanish Government, of Mr Aznar's Partido Popular
, have been disastrous, and the same applies to the Galician Government, while the European Union has stood on the sidelines, judging at the Copenhagen Council that five million euros would be enough to solve this problem – which is a problem for Europe as well as for Galicia and for other countries. The sea is now ruled by illegal and lawless mafias. Yet faced with this problem, the public, volunteers, seamen and fishermen have had to do the job of the government and of the European Union and solve this problem with their own hands, because the ‘black tide’ is still landing on the shores of Galicia, of the Iberian Peninsula and even of France. The Copenhagen European Council laid bare a serious political conflict: the Member States turned their back on the public, on the fishermen and on the volunteers who had acted so admirably. The Member States have neither implemented the ‘Erika’ legislation nor set up the compensation fund. This is very far removed from the attitude of the United States, where with the Oil Pollution Act they are preventing accidents and even setting up a responsibility fund of four billion euros. What does the Greek Presidency intend to do along these lines? I believe it should distinguish itself by taking action in this area.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 – (PT)
 Commissioner, it seems to me from reading the documents drafted by the Commission, which have your imprimatur on them, and from listening to what you have said, or at least what you have said from time to time in the past, that there is a real political conflict between your position, that is the Commission's position, and the Council's position as presented at Copenhagen. I do indeed have the document of 3 December, which I read with great interest. However, as I see it, the Transport and Environment Councils held in the same month and the Copenhagen European Council did not respond in any practical way to the Commission's request for urgent action. You called for the commitments given in the ‘Erika’ legislation to be implemented, Mrs de Palacio, and you called for an approach that went beyond those commitments, but the European Council turned its back on the victims of the disaster who at that very moment were scooping up oil with their own hands. The Council seemed to hold the Commission's views in contempt, and it is enough to say that it proposed only five million euros for Galicia and all the countries affected, whereas the United States is currently calling for four billion euros for the ‘Exxon Valdez’ accident. With this in mind, Commissioner, I would like to ask you why the Commission has not brought forward a legislative act like the United States' Oil Pollution Act, which provides a real basis for combating this problem. Furthermore, will Galicia be considered as a location for a European Maritime Safety Agency?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 – (ES) 
Mr President, I really wanted to talk about the budget in relation to the fact that the reprogramming of funds to meet the needs resulting from the Prestige
 accident had my support and I am grateful, if you will allow me, for the unanimity achieved in this Parliament. I must point out that reprogramming is not the right route, and that the Council has still not approved the compensation fund in the Erika
 packages, it has still not been approved in the Council of Ministers, the European Council, and there is a genuine division between the European institutions which is jeopardising the fight against the international maritime traffic in dangerous goods in our waters. I must also point out that the European Council has only given EUR 5 million for the Prestige
, a sum which I described yesterday as miserable and this must be said, bearing in mind that the United States have applied specific legislation through the Oil Pollution Act 
and are going to claim, and will achieve, EUR 4 000 million from Exxon Mobil 
for the Exxon Valdés
 accident. I believe these things should be pointed out so that the European Union may really become a political union which shows solidarity, especially in the case of an accident such as the one that has taken place in Galicia, which is a truly European problem. It is being suffered by Galicia because that is where the majority of traffic passes, but it is genuinely a European problem.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 – (PT)
 Mr President, the pictures of the fishermen and the volunteers fighting the oil slick from the Prestige
 with their small boats and their bare hands demonstrate the enormous strength of an entire people – the Galicians – and prove the culpability of the European Council and the Spanish State. It is now clear that Galicia’s citizens are suffering the consequences of the serious political conflict which opposes the positive proposals put forward by the Commission and which has led to the selfishness and irresponsibility demonstrated by the Member States of the Council. The Copenhagen decisions have not answered the anguished questions of the citizens but instead the interests of the predatory capitalism of the oil companies which, taking advantage of the murky and primitive international situation, reject all and any attempt to establish European legislation to protect our seas. The Council, as well as Mr Aznar, has shown contempt for the people of Galicia by having taken no rapid decision to help that region. It has shown contempt for the fact that Galicia suffers more disasters than any other part of the world. The Council has granted Galicia and the neighbouring territories a miserable EUR five million more, whereas the United States, which has strict and specific legislation, clearly lacking in Europe, is claiming USD four billion for the Exxon Valdez
 accident. Ladies and gentlemen, our citizens are demanding that we put an end to this situation, starting with setting up a committee of inquiry. This must never happen again. Never again! (Applause

 Mr President, I wish first of all to express my surprise at the question asked by the President-in-Office of the Council. I personally feel, as I am sure do all the Members of this Parliament, that an enlarged Europe will be a political Europe, with more democratic institutions and a Constitution, a fairer Europe, with greater internal solidarity, a Europe which takes its place in the world as a power, a force, a Europe of peace and solidarity, a Europe that improves the European Union, contributing to the historic unification of the continent, but not a Union that is institutionally different or new. Its name must be the European Union then, a name that is furthermore clearly pleasing to the ear and appropriate. With this in mind, I would ask, what then is the meaning of Mr Giscard d'Estaing’s proposal – which the President has just implicitly accepted – that the European Union’s name might be changed? Is this a desire on his part to play a leading role; vanity? Could this be a sign that the Chairman of the European Convention is attempting to reduce the Union’s political power? Can you give us a straight answer, Mr President, as to what you really think about this?
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will be aware that, at this moment, thousands of seamen and volunteers are working with their own hands in Galicia to resolve a problem which should not fall to them – a disaster caused by the idleness of the public authorities – making up for the absence of the European Union and the Spanish State. Mr President, I would like to express here at this time the indignation of the Galician people and their disappointment at the Copenhagen resolutions, which were a complete failure and which did not even take account of the demands of the European Commission, and there are therefore States in the European Union – the majority of the governments, with the cooperation of the Spanish Government, led by Mr Aznar – which prefer to attend to the interests of the large oil companies – I would even say of the criminal capitalist mafias – rather than protecting the countries and citizens of Europe.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

Mr President, the Prestige
 disaster in Galicia has the consequences of a natural disaster, but in truth it is a political disaster. It is political because neither the Member States, nor the European Union itself, nor this Parliament were able to take appropriate measures at the time to prevent ships such as the Prestige
 – and there are hundreds of them – from moving around Community waters. It is political because this Parliament, despite the fact that there have been seven disasters similar to that of the Prestige over the last twenty years off the Galician coast, did not have the courage to lay down legislation similar to the United States’ Oil Pollution Act, so that we could prevent this type of vessel, which are time bombs operated by criminal capitalist mafias, from moving through these waters. At the moment therefore, Mr President, since there is no European emergency plan to deal with these problems, hundreds and hundreds of Galician vessels are trying – together with the help of many States, whom we thank – to prevent the fuel oil from entering the Galician Rias. In the Arosa Ria, 500 small vessels are trying to resolve, through small-scale methods, a problem which is the responsibility of the Spanish State and the European Union. I will end, Mr President, by saying the following: I believe that the Presidency of this Parliament should go to Galicia and demonstrate human compassion and a desire to resolve the problem which that country, like many others, is suffering from; but especially Galicia, which is suffering this problem more than anywhere else in the world, should be shown the compassion and assistance it deserves. Thank you very much.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is said that one of the characteristics of Galicians is to answer one question with another and, as a true Galician, I shall therefore begin my speech with a question. Why, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, must CFP reform take place specifically in 2002? It is taking place because a transitional period has just come to an end in Spain and Portugal. Since 1986, Spain and Portugal have not enjoyed rights equal to those of the other States over the seas that belong to us all, as Community seas. This fact does not appear anywhere, however; it does appear in the Commission document, but Parliament has rejected it. We are drawing up a series of documents, regulations, as if the main reason for reform were not actually the fact that since 1986, five new States have joined the European Community and these States should have the same rights on Community seas that the Member States had when the European Community was made up of six States or ten. We must not uphold privileges and discrimination that allows these States still to be considered as intruders in seas that belong to us all. Having said this, we are now seeing enormous confusion. Privileges are being confused with the conservation of resources. In order to justify the privileges it is said that we want to conserve resources. We all want to conserve resources – that is not the problem; we accept all fair decisions to conserve resources; the problem is how to distribute between fleets, resources that scientifically, reasonably, with common sense, applying the precautionary principle, are considered fair. This principle is not being applied. This situation has arisen, with the reform disadvantaging Spain and Portugal, and therefore Galicia, which has been referred to so often today, because it has not even been considered to be a territory that depends on fishing. Maintaining – I am just finishing, Mr President – the principle of relative stability, scorning international fishing, failing to take into account that … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, the Commissioner said that he could not address the principle of relative stability because it is part of the CFP. CFP reform, which we should embark on today and in the next few days, is based precisely on the principle of relative stability, which is not unchangeable. On the other hand, the Commissioner said that another amendment was to maintain the status quo. The status quo in Community waters is maintained by the Commission and Mr Fischler, Mr President.

 Mr President, Galicia’s national poet, Rosalia de Castro, who always felt great solidarity with the fate of the Galician people, coined the phrase ‘black shadow’ to express a sense of anguish that troubled her. Today Galicia, and also the whole of Europe, is suffering from the ‘black shadow’ caused by political irresponsibility and the contemptible interests of the mafias that control maritime traffic and flags of convenience. The Prestige
 disaster is now the fourth to have occurred off the coast of Galicia in recent years. The names ‘Urquiola’
, ‘Aegean Sea’
 and ‘Casou’
 are, together with that of the Prestige
, part of our consciousness and of our collective misfortunes. On the Coast of Death and in the Rias Baixas and the Rias Altas, these misfortunes are remembered even more sharply. Therefore, in these emergency situations, we, the men and women of Galicia wonder: what good to us is the Spanish State – the authority whose main task and responsibility at this historic time is to protect our people, our nature, the marvellous Galician nature, and our economy, the persistent and long-suffering Galician economy? What good to us is the head of the State government who was absent from Galicia at a tragic time, whilst the inhabitants of the Coast of Death and the Rias were under attack from the Prestige
, and who, to universal scorn, was in Prague with NATO, dining out and sycophantically applauding President Bush and his unilateral and ‘preventive’ strikes? As a Galician and a supporter of European integration, I wonder, what major action have the Galician and EU authorities taken in this tragic situation? It is precisely in this Parliament that reactionary positions by Members contributed – and in this context I must agree with the Commissioner – to changing the legislation contained in the ‘Erika’ package, which would have prevented this accursed ship from continuing to move around our seas. Let us not be under any illusion: this disaster has consequences identical to those of a natural disaster, but it is really a political disaster and we know who the guilty parties are. Mr President, the location of the European Safe Seas Agency has still not been decided on, in contravention of the ‘Erika’ legislation. Once again, the governments of the Member States have not been equal to the circumstances. Following what has happened in Galicia, can any doubt remain that the Agency should be based in a region in which there is the greatest concentration of intercontinental traffic and where there is the greatest risk of accident?

 Mr President, as you all know, I was the original rapporteur for this report. The document was totally destroyed in the Committee on Fisheries and I felt compelled to give up the task of drafting the report, which was given to the Committee’s Chairman, Struan Stevenson. I know I am in a minority, but I must say that the main reason for my attitude is that the report we have just adopted ignores the main issue. By this I mean that the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is purely and simply a result of the fact that the transitional period of 16 years granted to the Spanish State and to Portugal, so that they need no longer be intruders in Community waters and have the same rights as the other Member States, has come to an end. I cannot, of course, accept this situation. I am also, of course, in favour of the conservation of stocks – I have nothing against this, in fact – but the report and the committee have not given due consideration to the economic and social consequences of the reform. Nor do they discuss a budget for a reform of such importance, but uphold the principle of relative stability, which is now discriminatory and grants privileges, because it was established when the EU had only six or nine Members. Furthermore, the report heaps scorn on international fisheries. I therefore dare say that there will soon need to be a new real reform of the CFP, to ensure that it is a genuinely common policy. It is now less of a common policy than it used to be!

Madam President, having heard the debate, I would like to draw your attention to a fact: following the terrorist action by Chechen rebels, 120 hostages have died, but also 50 terrorists. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, although we are talking about terrorists, there can never be any justification for an entirely summary execution such as that carried out by Russian troops when those people were probably fast asleep. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that no section of the press has spoken about this, which is very serious, because it is an offence against democratic and human co-existence – whether or not they are terrorists – and also to the fact that there has been no mention in this House of this action, which was outrageously barbaric.

Mr President, our group has requested the debate on the disaster that has taken place in Galicia – on European shores – and I would like to defend this position. The chairmen of our group have requested this debate in writing. I do not want to raise a point of order, but simply explain the issue before the vote.

 Mr President, I asked to take the floor earlier because this morning our group, in writing, called for the Commission to apply the ‘Erika’ legislative packages to the terrible situation in Galicia following the Prestige 
accident. It is no coincidence, Mr President, that the Erika
 and Prestige
 accidents took place in Brittany and Galicia, respectively. We need to provide protection for both these regions, in particular on the European Atlantic coast. The Erika
 disaster resulted in the legislation we know today being drawn up. The Galician disaster should lead to the immediate implementation of this legislation. We cannot continue to allow ticking time-bombs such as the Prestige
 to travel our waters irresponsibly when they are vulnerable to disaster. The routes to Europe from every other continent pass through Galicia. Four extremely serious accidents of this kind have recently taken place along the stretch of Galician coastline known as the ‘Coast of Death’, which is a privileged area. People are hoping that the socio-economic and ecological disasters will be remedied and that support will be given to those affected, and that the 77 000 tonnes still remaining on the Prestige 
will be prevented from flooding our coastline. We are hoping for immediate decisions from the Commission.

 Madam President, it is not by chance that the reform of the CFP is being undertaken in 2002. We must adopt it now precisely because, in accordance with their Accession Agreements of 1986, the transitional period established for the Spanish State and for Portugal are about to expire. From now on, therefore, these States must have the same rights in Community waters as the nine Member States that established the common fisheries policy at the start of the 1980s. Despite these obvious statements, Madam President, a majority in the Committee on Fisheries refused, in a totally unacceptable decision, to grant the Spanish and the Portuguese equal rights. The new CFP ought to acknowledge that the fleets of the fifteen Member States all have the same rights, thereby putting an end to the privileges and discriminations between the citizens, fleets and countries of the European Union. This pro-European – and I must say also Galician – position that my country has adopted inspired the report that I had the honour of drafting on the policies to be implemented for the reform of the CFP. Nor did we reject temporary restrictions based solely on the need to conserve fish stocks being established or maintained in this equal treatment of access to Community waters. We argued for the need to review or, where necessary, replace the principle of relative stability with a principle that is fairer and more consistent with the Treaties in this field. We argued for international fisheries policy and also joint ventures to be strengthened, and for public aid from the European Union for investment intended to improve conditions on board ships, which are currently very poor, to be maintained. For these and other reasons rejected by a majority in the committee, I cannot accept the report that now bears the name of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. The report nevertheless upholds some principles with which I agree, which survived the destructive offensive against the amendments tabled and adopted by the majority. This means that dialogue and a new compromise on the part of everyone where the reform of the CFP is concerned are still possible. In any event, they are still necessary.

 Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to an event that took place yesterday, which I felt was somewhat lacking in respect for the European Parliament. I was in this Chamber, expecting to hear a response to a question of mine to the Commission which had been placed third. Of course the question was not answered, as there was no time, and I then found out that Commissioner de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, answered one of the questions intended to be answered in writing directly to some television cameras. This question had been placed at number 90 and concerned a matter relating to the Spanish State, in response to a question from a Socialist MEP, accompanied by a Member from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Mrs de Palacio’s statement concerned a non-existent matter, because she was answering the Socialist MEP’s interpretation of the subject, and I consider that using a question to make it seem as if the European Union had answered an important and delicate question equates to manipulating this institution. She answered a question which, in any case, should have been answered by the Council. I do not think this institution should continue to be used to defend positions which, like all positions, are debatable. Regardless of what takes place in Spain and what is thought there, this institution must not be manipulated.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Council and the Commission, first of all I would like to express my full support for the resolution and the words of the representatives of the Council and the Commission here present. I do not need, either on behalf of my group or on behalf of my own Galician political organisation, to reiterate my categorical rejection and condemnation of terrorism. In this regard, I would like to emphasise that the resolution requires the creation of conditions to combat terrorism within the context of absolute respect for the law and human rights, both through the eradication of poverty and marginalisation, and through the fight against fundamentalist ideology, which – even more than poverty – is often given as the main justification for terrorism. Having said this, I would like to highlight three specific issues. First of all, I believe it is necessary to talk about a practical policy and reject – as the resolution also does to some extent – the militarist unilateralism of the United States and its doctrine of pre-emptive action which contravenes all international rules. In this respect, it should be highlighted that the US is preparing to take action against another country, which is governed by a dictatorship, an ideology which we clearly do not share; on the other hand, it has hardly been able to arrest anybody in relation to the September 11 attacks. Anybody at all. Twenty people were involved in these attacks in the US and nobody has been arrested in direct relation to them. I would also like to draw attention to the problem in the Middle East. It seems to me that we all agree that the problem of Palestine is at the root of international terrorism, and in any case, it is apparently the justification for this terrorism. There is no question of solving this as if it were a religious problem; it concerns a State, regardless of its professed religion, against a colonised nation, regardless of its professed religion. I believe that we should pay great attention to this issue. Until the problems between Israel and Palestine are solved, if peace is not promoted and the Palestinian State created, it will be difficult to combat a fundamental part of the apparent justification for terrorism. Mr President, I shall end by saying this: the fight against terrorism cannot – as the resolution says – become a fight against political groups which use peaceful means with a view to changing the political and social structure, such as, for example, what is happening in the Spanish State and in Europe in general. And frequently the necessary dialogue is not promoted, not only between political groups, but also between different institutions which are affected and which suffer the effects of terrorism.

 Mr President, I would like to make it clear that the unusual response given by the Commissioner and Vice-President of the Commission to Question No 93 in the corridor was made worse by the fact that she was accompanied, and her words – which she uttered as a representative of the Commission – clarified, by two MEPs, the Member from the Group of the Party of European Socialists who tabled the question and a Member from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I hope that this kind of manipulation, regardless of our political positions, which are all respectable, will not happen again in this Chamber. In my opinion this is absolutely disgraceful. I was waiting for Question No 2 from ‘Further questions’. I consulted you, Mr President, with a gesture, and, when you told me that Question No 2 would not be answered, naturally I left. This kind of behaviour should not take place. If Mrs de Palacio wishes to express her personal political opinion, she can do so at any time, with no need for recourse to this kind of manipulation, which I consider thoroughly deplorable.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to say that, were it not for the obstacles put in the way of the Spanish State and of Galicia, my country could achieve a level of milk production similar to that of Ireland or Denmark, whereas today it produces only 1.8 million tonnes. In any event, it would be able to meet its own requirements and double its level of production. Bearing this in mind and taking account of the farming structure in Galicia, which is based on family ownership, with a clear focus on milk production, I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council: would the Council accept specific measures – that could also be applied to another country – that would enable Galicia to increase its production whilst temporarily maintaining the intervention price system?

 Mr President, Commissioners, I have five very specific questions to ask. Why is the Commission proposing the reform of the CFP, which, as everyone knows, is planned for 2002, without a budget of its own? It should be rejected for this reason alone... Why is the Commission attempting to devote the entire FIFG fund to the reduction, which has no legal base, when the legal provisions on the change in the socio-economic situation of the labour market are not being complied with, despite having been agreed on, and even put forward by the Member States? Why is the Commission banning fleet modernisation, whenever this is required, as in any other economic sector? Why is there no budget for economic and social measures to compensate for the effects of the reform? Why is the Commission thinking of reducing the fleet by eight thousand vessels when the reform’s effects on the Mediterranean, which is home to a large part of the European fleet, are still not known?

 Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I cannot imagine that one day, in Spain and in Portugal, and even in the European Union, Brazil could be considered to be a third country for the Portuguese or Argentina a third country for Galicians or the Spanish. Although many people with dual nationality live in these countries, many children and grandchildren of Portuguese, Spanish and Galician citizens are not considered to be European. I consider, however, that this extremely close family link that exists between Portugal, Spain and Galicia and Latin America must be given very special treatment in the solutions that the Commission proposed for the visas discussed at the Seville Council. I hope that the Commission does not forget our family in Latin America.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission communications and the reports by Mr Busk and Mrs Attwooll show that the common fisheries policy is a giant with feet of clay! The Commission has considerable political and legislative power over the CFP but its instruments are relatively weak, as the Commission itself must acknowledge. There are evident shortcomings in the CFP’s financial resources and in the management of its implementation. Furthermore, there is a considerable disparity between the monitoring of each State and the sanctions applicable to the same irregular activities, which gives rise to a degree of suspicion about the CFP itself. This shortfall in instruments is also seen in the lack of staff and financial resources, in the participation of regional fisheries organisations and in the issue of agreements with third countries as well as in the scientific study of fish stocks, a field in which the Commission does not have a credible system. Bearing all of this in mind, I think it would be better to start the reform of the CFP by giving the Commission the necessary financial management instruments, establishing equal access to Community waters and to catches, whilst respecting the principle of sustainable development.

 Mr President, your few months in the Presidency have been long enough to make a caricature of what was agreed under previous presidencies on immigration and asylum, education and women’s employment and sustainable development. The issue of enlargement, which was confirmed in Laeken, you have left in a worse state. You have not pushed forward with the fair reforms of the CAP, the common fisheries policy and the Structural Funds, which are so important for the Union, for the Spanish State and for Galicia. You have not made progress on the Union’s proposals on the appalling situation in Israel and Palestine and you have abandoned Latin America, which is so dear to us. You have interfered, with insolent arrogance, in the work of the Convention, going so far as to style yourself virtual president of the Union. Everything under your presidency has been permeated by paranoia about security. You have been obsessed with the desire to reduce your position to that of head of Europe’s police and all you have to show for your efforts is the sad link you have made between immigration and crime.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I really must confess, before asking my question, that the figures I gave for Denmark’s catches in comparison with those of Spain and France were wrong: I did not mean to say Spain and France together, but six times more than Spain and six times more than France. Denmark has, according to what is known as the principle of relative stability, 44% of the fishing rights in Community waters, whereas the sum of France and Spain’s fishing rights add up to only 13%. I find the figures supplied by Commissioner Franz Fischler extremely confusing and I hope that the working group studying the impact on resources for human consumption finishes its work before the reform of the common fisheries policy is implemented. In any event, my question is the following: some countries in the European Union are clearly given preferential treatment at the moment when it comes to catches and I ask you whether any reform of the CFP is possible without implementing the principle of relative stability, which is so anti-European? What political reasons exist for maintaining it, as stated in the Green Paper and as stated now in the reform of the common fisheries policy?

 Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Prodi and thank him for his words. I thoroughly regret the fact that the Spanish Prime Minister is not present at this, the final plenary sitting of Parliament under the Spanish Presidency. Next, I would like to say that the six priorities cited by the Spanish Presidency at the beginning of this semester have, in effect, been reduced to two: achieving a fortress Europe and militarising democratic life; and making Europe a police state. In fact, Prime Minister Aznar currently wants to become the chief of police and would also like to achieve a Europe of States which stands in opposition to the Commission and Parliament. Among the proposals he has made for the reform of the Council, I am not sure what I should highlight most: his arrogance or his impertinence. Under the Spanish Presidency, all our problems are worse than six months ago. And Mr Aznar sees himself as permanent President of the European Union. The Irish referendum is neither planned nor completed; nor is enlargement, which is, furthermore, in an even more confused state; nor is the common agricultural policy, nor the common fisheries policy, where he failed to understand the real tension that exists between the northern and southern countries; immigration and asylum are confused with criminality and nothing has been done on the structural funds, on the European budget, on full employment, etc. In fact, there is nothing left of Tampere, Lisbon or Gothenburg. We should ask ourselves what is left of the spirit of these summits. In fact, what is left is a caricature in which José María Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, plays the leading role.

Madam President, I have conflicting feelings about this proposal for a regulation and this report. On the one hand, I feel I must make my rejection of this regulation clear, particularly with regard to hake, which suffers irrational and unjustifiable damage as a result of being treated together with cod. On the other hand, however, I believe that this will provide a valuable tool for calling into question the reform of the CFP, which was proposed by Commissioner Franz Fischler and presented by the Commission to the Council. The weakness of the Commission’s arguments becomes apparent simply from reading the Stihler report’s explanatory statement, particularly when the Commission attempts to base the regulation on supposedly reliable scientific studies. As the rapporteur points out, the proposal for measures was approved in 2001, on the basis of the information supplied by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, even before the drastic reductions of the TACs agreed for 2001 had been implemented. As the rapporteur points out, the scientific considerations are full of ambiguities and uncertainties. To quote from the text: ‘For hake, the decline in stocks has been less dramatic and therefore the scientific evidence is less clear cut and indeed the subject of some dispute’. I continue: 'Disagreement occurs over whether the two species [hake and cod] should be treated together, the speed at which recovery should be attempted and hence the severity of the measures necessary and what precisely those measures should be.’ etc. The report highlights, furthermore and above all, the impact and the economic effects that have not been addressed in the draft regulation. These, Madam President, are the many consequences that will occur or which are already occurring, in a sector which will become much more crucial and dangerous as a result of the unfair and irrational Fischler reform of the common fisheries policy.

 Mr President, I believe that we are engaging in a democratic process which, in truth, hides interests that cannot be denied. The reform proposed by the Commission will cause 28 000 job losses in an environment in which there is clear discrimination in allowing northern countries to take additional catches whilst denying this option to those of the south. We are all in favour of the conservation of resources, given that all Europeans have the same status in Community waters, something denied by the Commission and by many of those protesting, through interventions by the Spanish Government, which I cannot support.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I hope that your proposal for reform of the common fisheries policy will be rejected by the Member States and by this House. I in fact hope that you will resign, because you are working in the interests of the northern countries, who regard themselves as the owners of the Community's waters, and because you are acting against the interests of the southern countries, such as Galicia for example, which are still considered to be intruders in their own European home. Your proposal should be rejected because it amounts to ignorant despotism, because it is not based on serious scientific studies about the preservation of resources, and because it enshrines a discriminatory principle of relative stability that runs counter to the treaties, granting 16% of normal Community catches to Member States like Denmark, whereas Spain has only 6%. No one would dare to propose what the Commissioner intends to do in the fisheries sector in any other sector of the economy. Commissioner, you should make way for another Commissioner who is less partisan, more open and aware of the needs of the fisheries sector, and who will bring forward measures that are compatible with genuine sustainable development.

 Mr President, let me say, first of all, that the Lamassoure report comes within the context of Treaty reform and that the hypothetical approval of a European Union Constitution is a demand arising from the historical success of the integration of the European Union. This context must not be upset by circumstances inherent to the immediate situation that have nothing to do with the European institutions and everything to do with certain kinds of chauvinism and extremism and with the negative and, above all, ongoing abandonment of the welfare state as a guideline for national policies. The Lamassoure report responds to that demand and provides the Convention with valuable ideas on the crucial matter of the division of competences between the institutions of the European Union. In my brief speech, I should like to point out that, in its initial draft, under the concept of partner regions of the Union, the report attempted to institutionalise the presence in the European Union’s institutions of territorial units with legislative competence, that is, constitutional nationalities and regions, Länder
, federal states that have a constitutional and, in certain cases, an historical and political identity as nations, which cannot be ignored or denied in this Europe of unity in diversity. In the final report adopted today, however, this appropriate and necessary concept does not appear. Nevertheless, it clearly welcomes the need to recognise the role of territorial units, pointing to the part they should play in implementing Union policies and encouraging the Member States to let them participate in those Union decisions that particularly affect them. I think it is particularly significant that the Lamassoure report should ask the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up a special report as a way for territorial parliaments with legislative powers to participate in the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question was about a human problem, and your reply was full of unacceptable generalities. I suppose you are aware that the Spanish newspapers recently reported on immigrants working in a strawberry production company in Huelva who were, and I quote, "living like animals", with the company owing them more than three months' wages. If these immigrants, who are hoping for something called "work", are living in these conditions, one can only guess at the miserable conditions being experienced by the five thousand Moroccans I referred to in my question, who are roaming around that region without work. These people, after being used to working on the strawberry harvest for years, were this year replaced by temporary workers from eastern European states, who ironically benefit from labour contracts recognised by the Spanish Government but denied to our Moroccan neighbours. This behaviour, apart from being inequitable and inhuman, will lead to a deterioration in relations with Moroccan immigrants, will worsen the position of the communities affected, will damage mutual respect and even lead to racist behaviour, while encouraging political extremism, which we condemn. Mr President-in-Office, what are you actually planning to do to combat this type of behaviour?

I was genuinely unaware of this method of asking a question before knowing what was going to be debated here. Secondly, I think that this question, tabled, it has to be said, by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, is not just any question and opens a debate of enormous importance.

Mr President, yesterday once again eleven people from Africa died off the Spanish coast when their boat sank. We cannot remain indifferent to this tragedy, which occurs very often: although it will be difficult, we must seek a solution so that these people do not feel obliged to try to reach European territory in such a dramatic, and so often tragic, way. I believe it is honourable to remember this now, under these circumstances.

Mr President, like the last speaker, I was also in the Jenin refugee camps yesterday. The horror we witnessed has been described by previous speakers. It is not just a question of Jenin. The Palestinians we spoke to told us that the situation was the same in Nablus, in Ramallah and in all the cities of the West Bank. The horror is also political. The Palestinian Authority is completely destroyed. They destroyed the ministries, the schools, the infrastructures, the archives; everything. Meanwhile, on the road from Jerusalem to Jenin – on which police vehicles, tanks and jeeps stopped us frequently – we saw colonies of foreigners who arrive on Palestinian land, which looked like residential areas of Paris, London or Madrid, or any European capital. Wealth next to misery. We saw that it is possible for a sovereign State to confine the President of the Authority of a territory which has absolutely nothing to do with it, or a leader such as Barghuti, or how helicopters and tanks carry out terrorism. In fact, there are terrorists who commit suicide out of desperation, but there are also terrorist helicopters. We witnessed this the day before yesterday. With this in mind, I can only express pessimism if there is no clear intervention by the international community and the UN, the European Union and the United States in particular. Nothing can be done if the UN resolutions are not truly applied. I am aware – like everybody – of the initial Arab opposition to Israel, but this is not the fundamental problem today. The problem is that Sharon, and practically all the others, believe in their historical, moral, cultural and technological superiority. A religious minister who recently entered the government said that all the Palestinians should be thrown into the sea and that those who stayed there would be like the Turks in Germany or the Algerians in France. The progressives themselves do not really want a Palestinian state. In the face of this situation, what can the bantustans
 do when they are divided by settlements of colonists, by roads which are only used by colonists and the army, and divided by the army itself, in an area which furthermore is small and would lack, for example, the gorgeous Jordan valley? I believe that the Palestinians are right – the President of the Palestinian Parliament, or the successor in Jerusalem to the late Hussein – when they express their desperation to us. For us the only solution is the intervention of the UN and the European Union in particular. They cannot sort things out amongst themselves because Israel does not want a Palestinian State, it does not conform to their ideology, that is the reality. I believe that we must be aware of this problem in order to resolve it. I do not believe that Europe can feel guilty in this situation. Many sources in the United States say that Europe must not get involved given their previous experience. We are European citizens of the present, we cannot feel guilty and we cannot fall prey to the blackmail of anti-Semitism: since we are in favour of a Palestinian State, we are anti-Semites. It is not a religious problem but a political problem: a State which is humiliating and destroying a population. The problem is the occupation and how to convince, how to impose a solution on Israel and how to help Palestine. That is the issue for the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my Group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I support all those members who have previously spoken to condemn human rights violations in Guatemala; to request that the peace and reconciliation agreements be respected; to request that the crimes and atrocities committed during the dictatorship should be brought before the Courts and to condemn the atrocities that are still being committed, especially by so-called ‘clandestine’ groups, who murder, torture, and violate human rights. However, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a very specific condemnation with regard to an issue that appears very peculiar to many Latin American countries, such as Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and other countries that are still living under a colonial regime. There is a white Creole minority that continues to dominate and marginalise millions of indigenous people who, in spite of being the majority, are completely ignored by the State. These States are not democratic and, in order to maintain the traditional privileges of ownership, they dominate and marginalise the indigenous minorities, and create dictatorial regimes that torture and murder if these minorities should dare to rebel. In this way, this minority controls the judiciary, ownership, the police and the army, and I believe that, in these Latin American countries, until there is genuine democracy – as has happened in South Africa – until the indigenous minorities have power and until they are truly able to create their own State for themselves, there will be no solution to this problem of human rights violations in these countries. On many occasions I compare countries that are very close to our own – the Spanish states in particular – with African countries: these are very often in a state of poverty and have dictatorial regimes, but one day they will become democratic regimes governed by the previously marginalised majority. In Latin America the problem is much worse and we have to be aware of this in order for Europe to be able to help in the construction of truly democratic regimes, governed by the majority.

Mr President, I should like to explain my vote on the issue of the use of the official languages of the European Union in the European Patent Office. I defend unequivocally the right of all the official languages of the Community to be used in all circumstances, particularly since in the near future there might be a tendency to renounce this principle, in light of the increase from 11 to 22 or more official languages when enlargement to include further states takes place. I also believe that if a European Union language is to be considered the most appropriate as a working language, its universal dimension should not be forgotten. By this token, I should like to remind you that the Portuguese language – including Brazilian and Galician Portuguese – is the third universal language of the European Union, following only English and Spanish. This must be taken into account where patents and indeed any other issues are concerned.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I see that you are not going to give me a straight answer on an issue that the European public has been debating for several weeks, and which concerns a political matter that must now fall within the competence of the Convention, the institution that will be addressing this and other fundamental aspects of the future Constitution of the Union. My question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is whether or not the issues that are to be addressed at the European Councils will be referred at this historic moment to the competent institution, which is the Convention chaired by Mr Giscard d'Estaing? It is an extremely serious matter that the Spanish Presidency, which has regrettably said nothing yet about the political future of the Union, is remaining on the sidelines of a debate that deals with an issue to which, furthermore, it is going to be difficult to find any democratic solution that respects national and European diversity except through the existence of a government of the Union and of a European Parliament with full legislative powers.

Mr President, Commissioner, with the creation of the European Air Safety Agency, the European Union is proposing to achieve and maintain a high level of safety and environmental protection, which are of genuine importance to European society and also to European integration. We do, of course, support this idea. I should like, in any event, to say that safety and the protection of the environment are closely connected to the distribution of airports, which is suffering, in practical and serious ways, as a result of the trend to centralise airports that is prevailing in most European States and which is being promoted by central governments, which, for political reasons and reasons of power, are concentrating investment in capital cities, and by the so-called flagship companies, which, for the same reasons are centralising their flights and sending them into the same airports. Consequently, most of Europe, just like my own country, Galicia, is suffering considerable hardship through being deprived of decent lines of air communication, traffic is becoming concentrated to an extraordinary degree in the air corridors that link the capitals, and the communities that live near to these central airports suffer the consequences of the noise and the bottlenecks. All of this militates against the sustainable development that we must try to achieve from the points of view of both safety and economics and from the social and environmental angles. I would say that we are, therefore, facing a serious problem, which we must start to resolve.

Mr President, I know that a resolution is going to be adopted on the problem of Israel and Palestine during this sitting, but I believe we cannot start it without remembering that there have been 200 murders in Palestinian territory and that the Palestinian people are being humiliated by the army of a State. I therefore believe that we need this sitting to begin also... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is my personal belief, and one I share with my party and my group, that there can be no going back on enlargement towards the East. There is a historical basis for that view, but we should not forget that a commitment on our part is called for too. We have just heard a reference to Kaliningrad. At present it is part of Russia, but it was the birthplace of no less a figure than Kant, one of the thinkers who laid the foundations for modern Europe. We should also remember that the Ukraine is as European as Poland. There is a region known as Galicia in Spain, but there is another Galicia in Central Europe with Krakow as its capital. That region boasts a long history and is at present partitioned between Poland and the Ukraine. It should also be borne in mind that if Turkey joins, Europe will spill over into Asia. All the problems and political uncertainties related to this process must be taken into account. We are contemplating a Union with a population of 500 million and 28 Member States at the last count, if the Balkan countries do not join. Such a Union will need European institutions that are both more tolerant of diversity and stronger. The issue of the type of constitution we should seek also arises. Regarding economic uncertainties, it has been claimed that after 2006 the European budget could be maintained with 1.27% of European GDP. That is impossible in my view, if we wish to maintain the Structural Funds and European policies, notably the employment policy. We only have to recall the German experience. Differences between East and West still exist, despite the tremendous effort made. It is also important to respond to concerns regarding the environment, transport, and even the impact on this House. It is not clear whether the Treaty of Nice will have been superseded by the time the new Members join, but it provides for 732 Members of the European Parliament. What kind of enlargement will it be? Will ten countries be joining or not? I think these questions deserve careful consideration. Finally, I believe the issue of eastwards enlargement should lead us to reflect on the kind of Europe we are aiming for. A more diverse Europe should in the future be a world power working for peace and solidarity. By its very nature, it cannot be a militaristic power like the United States. All these thoughts should be aired in the House. We must avoid focusing on minor difficulties arising, because we have many major problems to deal with.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Government of the Spanish State refuses, in a way which is arbitrary and quite contrary to the winds of history, to allow the Union’s constituent nationalities and regions to play a role in the Union, not least in the Council of Ministers, and is trying to ignore the practices already in place in Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Austria. He is trying to base his approach on an absolutist concept of sovereignty, contrary to that of shared sovereignty which is, in fact, a fundamental principle of the European Union. In its folly – as illustrated by the Minister of the Presidency Mr Lucas, a minister who is very close to the President of the Spanish Government – the Spanish Government is both trying to confine the internal constitutional bodies to a consultative role in the politically useless Committee of the Regions, and also, ignoring the reality of the Union, wants to turn this body into senate, even if this means going against proposals such as the one put forward by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who reserves this role of senate for the Council itself. They could not be making a worse decision. This is why I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council: why is the Government of the Spanish State insisting on maintaining such an anachronistic concept of sovereignty in the Union?

Mr President, yesterday, in one of the Palestinian refugee camps, Ariel Sharon’s troops killed twenty-two people. I do not know whether to feel horror or shame at the Israeli Government’s treatment of the Palestinians, which reminds me of the treatment the Jews themselves received in Europe 60 years ago. I believe this must end and that the President of Parliament should lodge a protest and condemn such acts.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the situation highlighted by the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, in a country as extraordinary as Brazil, has contributed to undermining a determinist concept of globalisation – the ultraliberal capitalist concept – in which the will of individuals and of peoples, as expressed by the political, social and democratic institutions, is submitted and subordinated to a supposed rationality which, in practice, tends to widen the gulf between the rich and the poor and between opulence and poverty. It is we Europeans who should be concerned about this new reality, and we cannot play down the social demonstrations that express this concern, which, disgracefully, Mr Aznar has just done with regard to the demonstration that is due to take place this week in Barcelona. The countries of the Union already form the greatest economic power in the world, but on its path to becoming a universal political body, the Union must not express its economic power by dominating the sectarian and blind ultraliberal market or by simply imitating the military hegemony of the United States, and these are temptations into which some European Prime Ministers are falling. What we should be doing instead is defending the values and the social and democratic achievements that form the best part of our history, and we should maintain a presence in the world as a factor for peace and for progress, in an action which, as Commissioner Solbes knows, must be a great deal more ambitious than the action presented today by the Commission. We must put forward a concept of global relations that inspires the forthcoming constitution of the European Union.

 Mr President, it is my view that Parliament should reject the Green Paper. This position is not reflected, however, in the report now under our consideration, which, despite containing some acceptable and praiseworthy aspects, has not been drawn up with the necessary energy to counteract the positions of the Commission. In the Green Paper, the Commission in fact refuses to consider fisheries as a normal economic sector, crucial to the economy of various maritime countries, such as Galicia, which I represent, and as a sector which must carry out its activities within the norms laid down in the Treaties, respecting, above all, the principles of sustainable development. The Commission is upholding the privileges enjoyed by certain States by means of the discriminatory principle of relative stability; it does not propose an appropriate policy for fisheries agreements with third countries and even considers ending, in the medium term, structural funds for fleet renewal.
Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your priorities for the Presidency do not deal with, or at least place very much in second place, certain policies which, since they are fundamental to the Union and also for Spain and my nation, must be dealt with in 2002: the CAP, the common fisheries policy and the future of the Structural Funds. On the contrary, you intend to use your Presidency to indulge your authoritarian obsession against European diversity, denying a presence in the Council to nationalities and regions of the Spanish States, employing a notion of sovereignty which is now anti-historical and anachronistic in the Union. If your approach were correct, Mr Aznar, we would have to concluded that you are appearing here today as a President of a foreign institution. We do not think like that. I represent my nation and I am also a citizen of the Spanish State and of the Union, and there is no contradiction here. You are mixed up in an authoritarian manner in something which is resolved in the Treaties and in practice, while ignoring the fact that in the future, if we do not deal with the problem of sovereignty, not to mention separatism, we will ask ourselves not only why Slovakia can chair a Fisheries Council while Galicia, Andalusia or the Canaries cannot attend it, but also why the historic national status of the Malta or Luxembourg is rightly recognised, while that of Galicia, the Basque country, Catalonia, Scotland, Wales or Flanders is not.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I am very pleased that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner responsible for territorial policy have agreed firstly that it will be necessary in the future, with enlargement, to have a dual cohesion policy, although it is of a minority nature: the cohesion policy for the regions belonging to the fifteen current Members and the supplementary cohesion policy for the enlargement countries. I also note that they agreed on an issue which seems to me essential and in no way hypocritical: there can be no political Europe without an economic Europe, there can be no political Europe without a cohesion policy. That is also the case in the current States, and the European Union must assume these responsibilities in the future. How can it be done? How can it be achieved and with what instruments? We clearly have to improve the current application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. We only have to look at the differences between Ireland and Spain, in terms of results over past years, or between Portugal and Italy or Greece, if you will allow me. The application has been different, and as such Ireland has made extraordinary progress and Portugal has taken better advantage of the Structural Funds than many other States. This has not been the case with Spain, Italy or Greece, where, while State income has come closer to the Community average, this has not been the case in their internal regions, which indicates that the Funds are being badly applied, possibly because the State has taken advantage of the funds intended for the regions or because the policy of additionality has not been applied in the State. Mr Barnier, you have said, and you had said previously, that the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot be below 0.46% of Community GDP. I would remind you that this is the level they had in 1999 and that in 2006 it will be 0.31%. If in 1999, in view of the result, we had not managed to eliminate differences between the regions of Europe by means of these Funds, we must therefore be much more ambitious than you are proposing, although you have done so in a very positive way.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the figures provided by the Commission in its 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds – confirmed by the Second Report on economic and social 
cohesion – show that, despite the budgetary effort made in the 1994-1999 period, the considerable social and territorial inequalities that existed prior to 1994 still remain. The major initial regional differences have remained the same or have increased. Proof of this is the fact that the average per capita 
income of the 10% of the population that lives in the most prosperous regions of the Union is still 2.6 times higher than that of the 10% of the population living in the least-developed regions. Territorial inequalities that existed within certain States that have Objective 1 regions, such as Italy, Spain and Greece are also still very much in evidence. In contrast with this situation, we have seen a strengthening in recent years of the area between London, Paris and Hamburg. This is a huge central region, which accounts for only a seventh of Europe’s surface area, but for one-third of its population and which enjoys almost one-half of its total income, in a concentration of cities and employment that threatens the sustainable development of the European Union. Unfortunately, nothing suggests that these trends are likely to change over the next few years. The budgetary forecasts approved in Agenda 2000 for the present period are extremely restrictive, which means that, whereas in 1999 the percentage of the European Union’s GDP dedicated to cohesion policy reached 0.46%, in 2006 it will not exceed 0.31%, a return to 1994 levels. These figures are extremely worrying. Furthermore, one need only look at the experience of German reunification to understand that, if we do not do everything that we can to remedy the situation, the problem will get worse when the enlargement States join the Union. Given these circumstances, we must be aware that when we talk about Structural Funds policy, we are not dealing with ‘just another’ EU problem. On the contrary, we are talking about a fundamental issue, in that the direction of political Europe depends to a large extent on positive developments in cohesion policy both with regard to Objective 1 territories in the current EU that still need it and to the new Member States that will require budgetary funds that must not be additional or supplementary funds. Unless this is precisely the decision we take, we will see the unacceptable paradox of the much-needed cohesion policy for the new States being paid for with money taken from the budget that is today earmarked for the least developed countries of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow the European Union to take a step backwards in territorial and social development policy. Political Europe would not be what it is today without cohesion policy and it would be hypocritical and irresponsible to call for the one whilst refusing to provide the economic resources to make the other possible. In this context, I think that we cannot delay taking a decision that will ensure an increase in the Union’s budget for the next programming period that is considerably higher than 1.27% of the Community GDP.
