 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would like a separate vote on the last indent of paragraph 1(a), entitled, and I quote: ‘Delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo’. In our opinion, this represents de facto
 recognition of the existence of Kosovo, which we find unacceptable. I would therefore like us to be able to vote separately on this paragraph.

 Mr President, your presidency – as you have just pointed out – has been marked by events of major political import, which have, on more than one account, been a challenge for Europe and, at the same time, for our Parliament. Some of these are internal to the Union, especially what many call the institutional crisis, and which I would describe instead as an additional symptom of a crisis of confidence in, or a crisis of legitimacy of, the current European model among a growing number of our fellow citizens. Others have an international dimension, such as the conflict in the Middle East, which you mentioned. The latter, far from advancing towards a just and sustainable peace, is worsening as we watch and is poisoning international relations, when it is not threatening the cohesion of our societies. Others, finally, are shaking the entire planet, such as the environmental crisis and, ultimately, the financial, economic, social and political crisis, which is imposing on us certain choices of society or indeed civilisation. It is in this exceptionally complex context that you have had to lead the European Parliament and to represent it before our Member States and before the world. My group and I consider that you have fulfilled your duty with honour. Of course, our political choices are manifestly different and are sometimes at odds with one another. However, it is precisely on the ability to manage these necessary and healthy conflicts of ideas, whilst respecting everyone, that the holder of a high office such as yours is judged. Now, I can say that, as the chairman of a minority group which, in many people’s opinion, expresses ideas outside the current mainstream, I felt at ease under your presidency. Better still, whilst our political differences naturally remain unchanged, our relationship as people has been noticeably enriched. Mr President, we have known each other for 30 years. We have really got to know each other in the last 10 years of our excellent cooperation in the Conference of Presidents. I greatly appreciate your personal ethic, which has enabled you to recognise – at least I think so – that it is possible to be simultaneously a communist, a democrat, a European and a humanist. Thank you. (Applause)

 The GUE/NGL Group has abstained in the vote on the number of interparliamentary delegations, due to the reference to ‘Kosovo’ in the formation of a ‘Delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo’. The formation of a delegation for relations with a self-proclaimed state that is a result of violation of international law constitutes in itself a de facto violation of international law. This abstention does not concern all other delegations referred to in the same decision, which we support.

 Mr President, the assessment of the G20 results that we have just heard – success story, turning point in the crisis, an enormous success for the European Union, and so on – in my view raises two questions. The first relates to the analysis of the current situation of the world financial system with which Europe, as has been seen, is closely connected. Let us be clear, the desire of the G20 leaders to send, at whatever cost, a reassuring message to the market, and indeed to the public, led them to very much play down the current situation. In reality, forecasts of the estimated, but still largely hidden, banking losses are soaring from one month to the next. The worst is not behind us, it is in front of us. There was talk of losses of USD 2 000 billion three months ago, and that was already astronomical. Now, the IMF puts the figure at USD 4 000 billion. For its part, the Commission has just put a figure of EUR 3 000 billion on the funds put aside under various guises by the Member States to save the banks, in other words a quarter of their GDP. That is the price of the mad dash to cash for profit and to profit for cash. This grim reality underlines the importance of my second question. What is the real substance of the progress made on regulation by the G20 in London? When Joseph Stiglitz, who was, as you know, appointed by the United Nations to chair an independent committee of experts on the financial crisis, was asked: ‘Do you agree with the economist Simon Johnson when he says that the regulatory aspect of the G20 is close to zero?’, Mr Stiglitz replied, ‘Yes, I do’. The ink on the London statement was not even dry when the main member state of the G20, the United States, called on the speculative funds that are comfortably installed in the tax havens to buy at a knock-down price the toxic assets that are blocking the balance sheets of the US banks. We are really raising capitalism’s moral standards. In truth, the G20 did nothing to stop liberal globalisation. It ignored the key question of reorganising the international monetary system. It promoted the IMF without considering its transformation. It drew a veil over the immense social challenge created by this crisis. It prescribed homeopathic remedies where major surgery is obviously needed. Europe, I think, must go far beyond the G20. The house is on fire. Do you hear the cries of anger rising up from our societies? They are demanding not soothing words, but strong, practical action, now!

I wish to express my opposition to paragraph 17 of this report, which is yet another incarnation of the campaign against Strasbourg’s being the seat of the European Parliament. I should like to point out the following in this connection: Firstly, the choice of Strasbourg was, from the start, a highly symbolic decision linked to the history of Europe. The intention was to highlight the aim of a European process, as a force for peace and for the bringing together of the nations. It is because I believe that this aim is still relevant that I am arguing for the symbol of Strasbourg to be safeguarded. Secondly, I would repeat my desire to see a Europe emerge that supports the diversity of the cultures that characterise the nations it comprises. Why not have a significant European institution in Warsaw, another one in Barcelona, and another one still in Stockholm, in addition to the Commission in Brussels and Parliament in Strasbourg? Unless the sole aim is to have a business-driven Europe, nothing justifies centralising everything in one place, which is inevitably far from the peoples of Europe. Those are the reasons why I oppose paragraph 17 of the McGuinness report, which is otherwise problem-free.

 On several occasions, we have been able to express our views on repeated statements on the theme of ‘all totalitarian regimes’. Our group unreservedly condemns all totalitarianism. It unreservedly condemns Stalinism. At the same time, it strongly objects to any attempt to trivialise Nazism by burying it in a condemnation of totalitarian regimes, as is the case, once again, in the joint resolution submitted to us. This is why our group is refusing to participate in the vote on this resolution.

Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Brown, as you reminded us, 20 years ago the Berlin Wall fell, putting an end once and for all to the model which it embodied and which, in any case, had already been dying for some time. In these circumstances the temptation to give unbridled capitalism full rein was too great. The European Union has followed others in succumbing to this temptation. The fathers of this new model or their successors have today been overtaken by their now unmanageable creature. In order to get through what is also an existential crisis, we first have to dare to question. I do not get the impression that we are on such a path. At the last European Council, the President of the Commission said that we were equal to the situation. The President-in-Office of the Council said that he was highly satisfied with the results obtained, while the first prize went, as it often does, to Mr Berlusconi, for whom the European Union is a healthy body hit by a virus. Time will tell. So far, the rare voices of self-criticism have come from economic circles themselves, such as that of the chairman of Morgan Stanley in Asia, who said that we are all responsible: the financial institutions, the regulators, the rating agencies, the boards of directors, the politicians and the central banks, and that we need to accept all this collectively. That is what will change us. I think, Prime Minister, that you are the first European political leader to have taken your turn in sketching a mea culpa
. It related to the attitude which you adopted 10 years ago following the Asian crisis: an attitude which you today consider was insufficiently firm towards those who thought that these were passing problems. The old idea that markets were efficient and could regulate themselves is over, you said. I must say that I prefer this gesture of humility to the less-than-adequate speech given in this very House by your predecessor in a previous life. However, I am convinced that the problem lies elsewhere. As stated in the recent report by the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, we need to shut down the big casino. The doctrine applied over the last 20 years has failed spectacularly. That is why those who pompously announced the G20 as a new Bretton Woods at which capitalism would be recast or even moralised have deceived our fellow citizens. There will be no ‘eve of the revolution’ in London on 2 April. Unit, a large trade union in your country has, I think, found a very simple and accurate phrase to say where the shoe pinches. Its slogan for the march organised next Saturday in the British capital will be, and I quote, ‘Put people first’. It may seem obvious, but it verges on a Copernican Revolution in comparison with what has become the dominant system. This speaks volumes of the nature of the challenges of our times. (Applause

Mr President, Commissioner, the draft European Private Company statute is presented by the Commission as a component of the European Small Business Act. In this framework, and taking the United States’ model, it was a question at the start of setting aside a defined share of public contracts for small companies. Such noble intentions are only to be applauded. Unfortunately, it is totally different now that it has arrived, accompanied by the European private company. First, take the size of the target enterprises. In place of small enterprise, the already vaguer concept of small and medium-sized enterprises has slipped in. This has led finally, and I am reading from the explanatory statement of the draft regulation adopted by the Commission, to a ‘statute that can also benefit larger companies and groups’. This totally changes the philosophy of the policy, and now what will happen to these pseudo-SMEs? In truth, they will be subsidiaries of multinationals who, as we know, have long been demanding a single, less binding statute than what currently applies to the companies they control in the various European countries. Let us look now at the nature of the benefits offered to companies by the EPC statute. It is no longer a question of giving easier access to public contracts. Rather, and again I am reading from the explanatory statement of the Commission’s text, its aim is now ‘to improve the framework conditions for businesses in the Single Market’. To this end, all European Private Companies could have their registered office in one country and their real activities in another. They could also transfer their registered office to any Member State they choose. How can we not see in these provisions a way of allowing the companies in question to create constraint-free letter-box companies under the most indulgent conditions for the business world? Does not the Commission even specify that ‘the relevant applicable law is the law of the Member State where the EPC has its registered office, which applies to private limited-liability companies’? As the European Trade Union Confederation accurately notes: ‘there is a great threat that companies will use the EPC statute to elude the most protective legislation’ for workers. We now understand why the Commission did not consult the trade union organisations before adopting its proposal, contenting itself with the pure formality of an online consultation. To sum up, when reading this draft regulation it appears that the emphasis placed on ‘small enterprises’ is above all political window-dressing aimed at making acceptable a rehash of the sadly famous ‘country of origin’ principle. It amounts to a revamped Bolkestein. This is why my group proposes that Parliament send a clear signal to the Commission and the Council by rejecting this proposal for a European private company statute.

Mr President, Mr Solano, Commissioner, as I listened nearly a month ago to the children of Gaza speak, amongst the ruins of their house, of how they had trembled as the bombs fell, or to their parents describe the hell of those 22 days and nights that will forever mark their lives and the memory of future generations, I was not proud of Europe. I thought of some of the leaders of our Member States, of all those who will answer to history for their lack of political courage, the missed opportunities, for their lack of vision. I asked myself this question: to what extremes must the Israeli leaders push their inhumanity towards the Palestinians and their scorn for law and the most fundamental values before the main European political leaders dare to raise a finger and say finally, ‘Enough is enough’? Those who call themselves friends of Israel to justify the impunity and unlimited accommodation shown towards its current ruling class should reflect on these words from the great Israeli writer David Grossman, whom I wish to quote: ‘Amidst the wave of nationalist hyperbole now sweeping the nation, it would not hurt to recall that in the final analysis, this last operation in Gaza is just another stop along a trail blazing with fire, violence and hatred. A trail marked at times by victory, at other times by defeat, but which is leading us inevitably to ruin’. Or let them ask the same question as Shlomo Sand, the famous Israeli historian, whom I also quote: ‘We sowed desolation. We have proved that we have no moral reserve. Have we strengthened the peace camp among Palestinians?’ He continues: ‘Israel has been pushing the Palestinians to despair.’ For 20 years, Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority recognised the State of Israel with nothing to show in return. Israel refused the offer of the Arab League in 2002, ladies and gentlemen. Everyone talks about the Arab League and about the Arab League’s peace project. It has been in existence for seven years. What has Europe done to seize this opportunity? I therefore come back to Shlomo Sand: ‘Israel refused the offer of the Arab League in 2002 of full recognition of Israel with the pre-1967 borders.’ The Israeli historian concludes thus: ‘Israel will make peace only if pressure is brought to bear on its policies’. This leads to a question, Mr Solano, as you said nothing on the subject of international law. What pressure is the Union prepared to exert on Israel over Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, to remind its current and future leaders that membership of the international community in general, and the privileged partnership with the European Union in particular, come at a price, that they have no place for military occupation, nor war crimes, nor a policy which pushes each day towards a divorce between Europe and the Arab-Muslim world? I would wish, as a European, not to have to place the hope for a change in policy towards the Near East solely on the occupant of the White House. I would still like to believe in an about-turn by Europe. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I unfortunately have to inform you that we have just learned that the headquarters of the United Nations agency responsible for assisting refugees in Gaza has just been hit by shells fired from Israeli tanks.

Bearing in mind the vote that is going to take place shortly, I think it important that each of you be aware of this fact. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, without a doubt, we shall remember this French Presidency. It will be remembered on account of the seriousness of the events that have taken place during the last six months and on account of the exceptional significance of some of the issues it has had to deal with. However, it will also be remembered, I fully acknowledge, on account of the rather unusual style of the President-in-Office of the Council, a combination of determination, resourcefulness and iconoclastic methods in relation to the Community’s established canon, all of which are the sort of things of which I would approve. Apart from the style, we will remember above all the mode of governance of the European Union that he initiated, in particular the irruption of politics into a world where it traditionally had no place, something that I have always called for. I am also convinced that the President of the European Council may not exactly appreciate, but will at least accept, with better grace than at the time of his last speech to the European Parliament, my departing from polite, conciliatory comments, this time in relation to the last European Council, in order to point out a few problems, because real politics implies a frank but respectful exchange of ideas. I must firstly mention the climate change and energy package. Obviously it would have been tragic if the European Council had been thwarted over this important issue for civilisation. I understand, therefore, that the fact that a compromise exists between the 27 has been highlighted because of its importance for the authority of the European Union and especially for the follow-up process. For all that, ought one to speak about a historic agreement and one that will make the European Union a model? I do not think so. Surely this compromise risks the result that the vast majority of European industries will be exonerated of any ecological constraints? Surely Europe risks reducing its own emissions by only a small proportion by contenting itself with making a contribution to reducing them outside of Europe by means of the compensation mechanism? Surely developing countries are rightly expressing their bitterness in the face of the lack of any binding mechanism for financial solidarity with regard to them? If this model, as it stands, became widespread, it would be impossible to achieve the essential objectives laid down by the global scientific community. It is, therefore, a good thing that a European agreement exists but, at this stage, its scope is not up to meeting expectations or needs. (Applause)
 I advocate the same clarity when it comes to assessing the recovery plan adopted in Brussels. Noisy self-congratulation would, in my opinion, send a counter-productive message to our fellow citizens. At a time when household consumption is falling, when more and more plans for cutting jobs are being announced, and when social tensions are mounting – look at Greece – this plan raises many questions. Recovery for whom? Who is going to pay for this new plan costing billions? What results is it going to bring? Why, in the context of the same plan, does one Member State increase the purchasing power of its people while another only helps businesses? How is it that loans granted to banks are not going to companies, because they are the ones who need direct help now? Why do Member States who bail out banks not systematically take proportionate control, in order to create conditions for responsible management, geared towards creating jobs and wealth that are useful to society? There are so many common-sense questions that it would be very wise to answer before any other consideration. Finally, no one will be surprised that my group does not congratulate the European Council for putting pressure on the Irish people. You are aware that the Irish people’s expectations of change, like those of European people in general, are much deeper than those you have described. You will have another illustration of that shortly in the streets of Strasbourg. You have to listen to them and give them answers because, just as you have said, Mr President, sweeping the dust under the carpet leads to difficulties in the future.

Mr President, our request is based on a very clear fact known to everyone. At the end of last May, an official delegation from our Parliament, representing all political groups, went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza. On the basis of what they observed on the ground, at the end of this visit, they unanimously adopted a statement. This statement includes the following:  ‘We strongly feel that without serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on the ground, the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations’.  (FR)
 Since then, no such significant signs have been apparent, quite the contrary. This is why we think that it would be a very bad signal today if we were to vote in favour of the recommendation made by the Council. My group proposes that we postpone this vote until there is evidence, in Israel’s policy and on the ground, of these famous signs called for unanimously by the delegation representing our Parliament a few months ago.
 Francis Wurtz,

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, never in the history of the European Parliament have we had to react to a multidimensional crisis of such depth and such gravity, and one cannot help but fear that the worst is yet to come. Firstly, a number of countries of the South, in principle partners of the European Union, are on the brink of the abyss: in addition to the food, environmental and energy crisis, there is the financial crisis. These countries have got nothing to do with it, but it is hitting them hard. A fall in revenue, a fall in investments, a fall in growth: they are the ones overlooked most by the international effort, to the extent that the Director-General of the FAO, Mr Diouf, was obliged to point out that only 10% of the emergency funds pledged by the major powers in June have so far been allocated. Those seeking to clean up capitalism have their work well and truly cut out. For their part, emerging countries are being affected by the crisis, but it is not yet possible to assess the social consequences of this. On our doorstep, a State not long ago presented as a model of success, Iceland, is under threat of bankruptcy. Within the Union, new member countries such as Hungary – which cannot even invest its treasury bonds anymore – are wrestling with extremely serious problems that are going to result in unprecedented sacrifices for their populations. The turnaround has also been spectacular in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain, which were cited just now as an example. The shock has been considerable everywhere. This is liable to be the case in France, too, if the recession further exacerbates a particularly tense social climate, with huge job cuts, a fall in public spending, financially starved local authorities and public service privatisation projects. This is another issue, you may say. It is not, for if each of our countries is threatened with a social crisis of unimaginable dimensions, it is because of a development model for which our people are today paying a high price. The model was formed in the United States and in the United Kingdom, but the European Union fully embraced it as its own with the toppling of the international balances of power twenty-odd years ago. Since then, it has been this model that the Commission has fed us with, month after month, and it is this model that pervades our treaties, the case-law of the Court and a number of our policies. That is why, Mr Sarkozy, I cannot share your diagnosis of the terrible evil currently eating away at our societies. The spark that started the fire can certainly be traced back to New York, but the fuel that caught fire is as much in Europe as it is in the United States, and all those political leaders who have worked on Europe’s strategic change of direction over the past 20 years owe our fellow citizens an explanation. They must not think that they are off the hook today by taking measures – necessary measures, all the same – concerning reporting standards, financial supervision of rating agencies, or golden parachutes. Beyond this, however, it is the heart of the system that needs to be changed: money for profit, and profit for money, that awful spiral that gives rise to the devaluing of work, salary deflation, social expenditure rationing and the wasting of the planet’s resources, as well as the marginalisation of a huge proportion of the global population. Indexes do not lie: only 2% of monetary transactions today concern the production of goods and services; 98% relate to finance. Tackling the root of the evil from now on means attacking the increasingly drastic financial return criteria, which are absolutely incompatible with the non-discriminatory promotion of human capacities and with genuinely sustainable development. Equally, a Bretton Woods II worthy of the name should aim to introduce collective control of money creation worldwide, that is to say, to replace the false international common currency that is the dollar with a true international common currency designed to serve as a lever to correct the intolerable inequalities that destabilise the world and to contribute to the balanced development of humankind and of the planet. We are so far away from that that it is better, at this stage, to avoid an excess of superlatives on the radical reforms at work, unless the European leaders’ sudden propensity to want to change the world is inspired by the motto of Prince Salina in The Leopard
: ‘everything changes so that nothing changes’. They are in danger of having a rude awakening before too long, however. (Applause)

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, for several weeks now we have been watching global panic and unbearable losses, against a dizzying background of billions of spiralling euros and dollars. This has been generated by a system in the name of which European leaders have for years been recommending moderation on pay and caution on social expenditure, and have allowed inequalities to soar. These same leaders are now flying to the rescue of the banks to refloat them, before putting them back in the private sector, while announcing a long period of recession and sacrifices for the general population. Many people following these events, totally stunned, cannot help but see a lesson in them, not about excess, Mr Watson, but about the very essence of capitalism in all its injustice and brutality, whatever the phenomenal transformations it has undergone over the last few decades. I think European leaders are going to have some explaining to do to our fellow citizens. Consider your responsibilities rather than seeking to challenge universal suffrage in Ireland, or anywhere else. Today, I just want to make three immediate, good-sense proposals to deal with the most pressing issues while opening the way for a real change of political orientation. In the first place, I think we should not skimp when it comes to reassuring small and medium savers who are legitimately concerned about their modest assets. The announcement about this was, I think, late, timid and woolly. On 15 October, the whole of the European Council needs to formally provide an absolute guarantee for deposits throughout European Union territory. Secondly, a rudimentary awareness of ethics as much as a simple concern for effectiveness should prevent sorcerers' apprentices from profiting now or in future from the public intervention made necessary by the collapse caused by their irrational exuberance. That is why every government should, or in any case should be able to, compensate for the aid given to financial institutions in peril, through the lasting nationalisation of their healthy assets. The purpose of this would be to set up a public financial sector, in the future, devoted entirely to financing socially worthwhile investment, particularly the kind that creates jobs. Thirdly, and more generally, the real economy must be assisted with an ambitious new credit policy. This concerns the EIB as much as the ECB. The EIB, to start with, should be given the responsibility and resources for achieving the task of guaranteeing SMEs access to all the credit they need to develop production, provided that real, properly paid jobs are created and the rights of their employees are respected. In this regard, the decision taken to assist SMEs by providing EUR 30 billion within three years is worthwhile, but I feel the amount is too low and the timescale too long. In France alone, SMEs need EUR 60 billion a year, and there are twenty-seven countries in the EU. Furthermore, it is now that they need the oxygen in many cases. Later may be too late. As for the ECB, surely it is now or never that we must ask it to adapt its role to the vital needs of the economy and our companies by directing money not to the financial markets, but to the real economy? It has an instrument for doing this, and we do not understand why it is adamant about not using it. The instrument is selective credit, which is very expensive if it is used for financial operations, but is very accessible when it encourages jobs, training and all the worthwhile investments. I am aware that some of these proposals are not very orthodox. So what? Instead of orthodox politics in a collapsing EU, I prefer the idea of reactive, creative politics serving the renewal of Europe and a life of dignity for Europeans.

Madam President, if the main European leaders wished to illustrate the gulf separating them from European citizens, they need only react as they did to the financial crisis following the meeting of Finance Ministers on 14 September 2008. What are the main measures that have been announced, apart from a welcome but insufficient increase of EIB loans to small and medium-sized enterprises? They can be summarised in three points. Firstly, as regards hopes for a fiscal stimulus, I quote Jean-Claude Juncker: ‘We have ruled out adopting a European revival plan.’ We are going to apply the Stability Pact, the whole Pact and nothing but the Pact. Next, with regard to the deregulation process under way, I quote Christine Lagarde: ‘We must not allow any slowing-down of the structural reforms’; Jean-Claude Trichet: ‘Anything that can be done to improve the flexibility of the economy is good enough for us’; and Jean-Claude Juncker: ‘We must reform the labour market and the markets in goods and services. Competitiveness needs a bigger playing field.’ Finally, the question on all our minds is who should foot the bill? Again, I quote Jean-Claude Trichet: ‘Banking watchdogs should not have disproportionate requirements regarding credit agencies’, and, on the other hand, according to Jean-Claude Juncker: ‘Everything must be done to prevent salaries from getting out of hand’. We wish to tell them this: come out of your bubble and try to put yourself in other people’s position. They see, on the one hand, finance ministers moving heaven and earth for the major global speculators – a sum of EUR 110 billion has been released by the ECB alone – and, on the other, the employees who are at risk. In attempting to reassure the markets, you are unsettling companies. The truth is that, in the name of the free movement of capital and the famous open market economy with its free competition, financial leaders have collectively fuelled devilish mechanisms that they can no longer control. Let me remind you that, five months after the beginning of the subprime crisis, Mr Trichet, representing the 10 main world central banks, was still talking only of simple ‘market corrections’ and announcing ‘robust growth, even if there is a slight slowdown’. Three months later, he was urging Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to ‘give the private sector a chance to rectify itself’. What insight! If a system can lose its own cronies in this way, it is in the midst of an existential crisis. This is why, if we wish to avoid further increasingly painful collapses, we must have the courage to make a break. Firstly, we must break with the idea of productivity based on the lowering of salary costs and social expenditure. We must reverse the continuing trend of reducing the share of salaries in added value. That is not the source of inflation; it is the immoral actions of financial operators. Secondly, we must end the complete reliance on financial markets to fuel the economy, as they are not feeding but poisoning it. The European Central Bank has a decisive role to play in directing money towards a socially effective economy, one that creates jobs, promotes training and develops public services, that ensures sustainable production and useful services, that has a place for research and development, respects public enterprises and the public interest and puts cooperation above economic warfare. However, to achieve that, the mission of the European Central Bank must change. It should refinance banks at very different interest rates depending on whether the loans benefit the sound economy I have just described or, on the contrary, are to be used as the basis of unsavoury financial operations. The conditions of access to loans should be advantageous in the former case and extremely dissuasive in the second. At the same time, rigorous controls are needed with regard to banks and funds and a tax should be introduced on financial capital movements. Finally, work should begin on radically reforming international economic institutions, as called for recently by President Lula in his address to the United Nations. Thirdly, there needs to be an end to the self-satisfaction and condescension of a small elite explaining to citizens that the only valid choice is its own. If we could at least discuss all this seriously with an open mind and a sense of responsibility, then the crisis would, in one respect, have brought some benefit.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, with regard to the crisis in the Caucasus, adopting a pro-Georgian or a pro-Russian stance can only lead to deadlock. This has been blindingly obvious since the breakup of the Soviet Union 17 years ago as this region is full of recurring tensions and disputed borders. It is a place where the collective memory is haunted by the inherited traumas of successive wars and violence, where the ethnic and religious mosaic and the accumulation of resentments and humiliations provide dangerously fertile ground for nationalism. In this context, political irresponsibility will cost dear, and that is true for everyone. It is certainly true for the Georgian President who, since his election in 2004, has constantly pandered to the spirit of revenge in relation to the breakaway territories. He has constantly pushed his luck in terms of his allegiance to the Bush administration and his policy of confrontation in the region. He has launched an attack on South Ossetia, about which Mr Van den Brande, one of the co-rapporteurs of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, responsible for monitoring problems in the region, has declared having been – and I quote – ‘shocked by the stories of the refugees about the massive and indiscriminate shelling and bombing of Tskhinvali and the destruction of residential areas’. This strategy is disastrous for Georgia, for the Caucasus and for Europe. This lesson is also valid for Russia. The brutality of the counter-attack, including against civilian populations, the continued occupation of strategic sectors of the Georgian territory, the expulsion of Georgian populations from South Ossetia and the unilateral recognition of the independence of the two breakaway territories are just as likely to threaten the interest generated in more than one European country by the initial international initiatives of the new President. Russia has everything to lose by returning to a period of political isolation in Europe and in the world. Finally, the West as a whole would do well to assess the unprecedented damage already caused by the American attitude of adventurism and the European attitude of follow-my-leader in this part of the continent. The limitless expansion strategy of NATO, the bombing of Serbia, the recognition of the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo, the support for the installation of the anti-missile defence shield on European soil, not to mention the extreme glorification of the region’s leaders who should, perhaps, be more cautious when making anti-Russian and pro-Western statements, all these choices are evidence of a short-sighted policy worthy of the current White House, but not worthy of a European security policy. This strategy of militarising international relations and causing political confrontations has failed before our very eyes. In addition to sending in European observers under the aegis of the OSCE, the EU’s priority should therefore be to prevent any escalation at any cost so that, as quickly as possible and without any signs of arrogance, it can explore the possibility of drafting a new pan-European treaty for security and cooperation which would be legally binding and which would encompass all the problems that have currently been shelved: territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, the fate of conflicts that have reached a stalemate, non-use of force, disarmament and even security of energy supplies. This challenge is certainly more difficult to tackle now than ever before but, without such a perspective, I fear the worst is yet to come. In adopting our position, let us remember that today, the first of September, is the International Day of Peace. (Applause

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to focus my speech on the twofold nature of this French Presidency, namely its unquestionable strong point and its all-too-obvious weak point. Its strong point, in relation to the usual tenors of the Union, is that it does not say that Europe is doing well and that it should continue along these lines when increasing numbers of Europeans think that it is doing badly and that things should change. So far so good. But what then? This is where the problem lies. What conclusions do you draw, Mr President, from this apparent lucidity about the crisis of legitimacy that the Union is experiencing today, in particular its economic model and its operating mode? You say that you want to understand and that you respect the concerns that Europeans have about the Union, but you put pressure on the Irish people to go back on their decision, when they were only voicing, like the French and the Dutch, what millions of other Europeans are thinking. You criticise, rightly, the way the European Central Bank has been managing the euro from its ivory tower, but you never recommend re-examining the statutes which grant it all those powers and even assign it this task! You state, on the subject of immigration, that you want to ‘serve our values’, but you supported the shameful directive, condemned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, by all human rights organisations and by European churches, precisely because it violates essential human values. You ignore the social question – which, you say, should remain the sole responsibility of Member States – but you say nothing about the European Court of Justice, which delivers ruling upon ruling placing the different social models within the Union in competition with each other and basing itself on Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty. You say that you did not like the image of the ‘Polish plumber’. Neither did I. This was an expression coined by the populist right and made popular on television screens by Mr Bolkestein. I say ‘Welcome to workers from all countries’ on an equal footing in all fields. (Applause from the left)
 This is precisely what current European law refuses. President-in-Office, may I remind you that, according to the Commission, in Lower Saxony, for the same work on the same construction site, a worker from another Member State can be paid half the minimum wage applicable to a German worker. This is what we do not want. Do you know what a man who cannot be accused of populism, namely John Monks, Secretary-General for the European Trade Union Confederation, thinks? He considers these decisions ‘considerably problematic’ because, he says, they decree ‘the primacy of economic freedoms over fundamental rights and the respect of labour law.’ What is your answer to that? You claim that you want to build a ‘Europe which protects’, but we do not hear you criticising all those structural measures which make the existence of Europeans precarious: the obligation to open public utility undertakings to competition; the pressures of the Stability Pact on wages and social spending and the number of ‘guidelines’ prepared by the Commission and adopted by the Council, which you apply in your own country with zeal. I could mention Guideline No 2: the reform of pension, social security and health care schemes. Guideline No 5: labour market flexibility. Guideline No 13: the removal of regulatory, commercial and other obstacles which hinder competition unduly. And I have not mentioned all of them. The reversal of France’s – and Italy’s – position has just enabled the Council to go beyond the obligations that it set itself by agreeing on a draft Directive permitting a 65-hour week. This consecrates Dickens as the new father of Europe! One last word, Mr President: this weekend, in front of your European guests – the President of Parliament, the President of the Commission and in front of 2 000 French right-wing business executives – you concluded your speech with words which were interpreted by the trade union movement in its entirety as an incitement – and a very unwise one – by stating that now, when there is a strike, the French people no longer even notice. The day after this lofty event, your Minister for Education explained that this was ‘a way of reassuring our European partners in the presence of the most eminent among them.’ Well then, if you must insult the trade unions to reassure European leaders, it is definitely time for change in Europe. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, let us face facts. The history of European integration, its dominant ideological currents, practices inherited from half a century of close cooperation within the Commission, the Council and Parliament – all this has resulted in a sort of Christian Democratic-Social Democratic condominium within the European institutions. I am not passing judgement here; I am simply stating a fact. In this Parliament, the qualified majority necessary for the adoption of any legislative text at codecision means a constant search for consensus between the two main groups, which further marginalises the expression of differences and divergences. The question is therefore simple: do we want to exacerbate this tendency to avoid conflict by tightening the conditions imposed for the formation of political groups, on the eve of elections that will see the number of MEPs per country decrease, therefore further penalising minority groups, particularly in the least populated countries? How credible would these professions of faith in favour of pluralism be then? The quality of the democratic debate will not be improved by swelling the ranks of non-attached members. This is why my group is unanimously in favour of maintaining the current rules on the formation of political groups, even though our opinions differ when it comes to the refusal of the two main groups to accommodate our request concerning the procedures to follow: acknowledge the disagreement or accept a compromise. The majority of my group – including me – has now spoken out in favour of the compromise in a sole bid to help perpetuate pluralist expression within this Parliament, yet with the utmost respect for those who think differently, because at the end of the day we share the same principles. These principles have a name, and that name is democracy.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, during the past six months a number of decisions have been taken by the Council that Mr Janša failed to mention; and yet they are the type of decisions that strike a chord with the citizens and that influence what people think about the European institutions. I shall mention three such decisions that were taken this month alone. I hasten to add that I am not incriminating the Slovenian Presidency but rather all those Member States which made it possible, in each case, to achieve the required majority. The first example: the agreement reached on 9 June on the draft directive on working time. In this instance, the Council more than failed to meet expectations, it literally infuriated the entire trade union movement: the refusal to challenge the derogation enabling the maximum working week to be extended to 65 hours, or even more; unconditional ‘annualisation’ of working time; and the introduction of the concept of ‘inactive part of on-call time’ which will no longer be considered as working time. Long live social Europe! The second example: the outrageous directive on the harmonisation of the rules governing the deportation of illegal migrants. This text was condemned not only by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International, the International Human Rights Federation, the European Trade Union Confederation, the Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community and the fledgling Latin American democracies but also by eminent figures who are least likely to be suspected of excessive severity towards the European Union, such as Jacques Delors. Welcome to a Europe of human dignity! This also applies to all the European institutions, including Parliament. The third example: the launch, on 16 June, of official negotiations with Israel with a view to significantly improving relations between the European Union and that country, and this after a year of secret talks. I would point out that a delegation representing all of Parliament’s political groups stated unanimously, on 2 June in East Jerusalem, and I quote:  ‘we strongly feel that without serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on the ground, the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations’.  Good luck to Europe’s credibility in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean! It is against this background that a European Council was held which, to top it all, has just deferred by four months consideration of possible measures to combat rising oil prices that, as has been said, are strangling tens of millions of ordinary people. Oh, I forgot: ‘the European Council agreed that more time was needed to analyse the situation’ and to understand the reasons for the disenchantment of our fellow citizens. If I have understood the President of the Council correctly, ‘communication’ will do what remains to be done to convince people that ‘all is well’. Good luck!

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council would be well-advised to refrain from displaying any sort of arrogance towards the people of Ireland, who merely exercised a democratic right recognised by their Constitution. Rather than calling for the continuation of the ratification process in an attempt to isolate this new black sheep, it would be better to knuckle down to a clear analysis of the situation. The Irish ‘no’ vote was particularly strong among the working classes and I would remind you that turnout was much higher than in the past; according to my Group, this reveals that the crisis surrounding the legitimacy of the current European model is growing ever deeper. This crisis was already at the heart of the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes; it is expressed differently elsewhere but it is always an underlying element. Remember the large-scale protests against the Bolkestein Directive; think of the debate that arose after the Laval and Viking affairs, particularly in Scandinavian countries, or in Germany after the Rüffert judgment. In this respect, I want to say to my friend Martin Schulz that I agree completely with what he said about Mr McCreevy. The problem is that those decisions – the ones I have just mentioned – were taken not by Mr McCreevy but by the Court of Justice on the basis of specific articles (Articles 43 and 49 of the current Treaties incorporated in the Lisbon Treaty). Think, too, of the political impact of the powerful strike in Dacia, Romania against ‘low-cost Europe’. Look at the anger of farmers or small-scale fishermen who are in dire straits. What lies at the root of all these situations is first and foremost the current European economic and social model: instead of providing security, it leads to greater insecurity. That is the number one problem. Another factor is the way in which the Union functions. Decisions are taken far from the people and without the people. We are content with explaining them to them rather then consulting them. The deliberate decision to present the Lisbon Treaty in a form that is totally illegible to a lay person is, in this respect, a spectacular illustration of what I would call ‘the ivory tower syndrome’. This has devastating effects on our citizens, especially the less populated nations, which feel as though they are being bandied about to satisfy the interests of the more powerful nations. Finally, there are more and more questions in many countries, including Ireland, about the role Europe plays in the world, where it is expected to ensure that there is a much stronger emphasis on the force of politics rather than the politics of force. Running away from these debates means exacerbating the crisis in Europe; conducting them in complete transparency would be a first step on the road to finding a solution.

 Mr President, I would like to put two questions. The first is the same question put by Mr Swoboda, who asked for more time for the debate on the European Council and the issue of the referendum. The second question is whether we should separate the debate on oil prices from the fisheries debate or hold a single debate on both. Those are two separate questions. I suggest you should take the question of speaking time for the debate on the European Council first, and only then take the question about fisheries.

Madam President, Commissioner, the challenges involved in Europe’s relationship with the people of the southern shore of the Mediterranean far exceed those of a simple neighbourhood relationship. It is perhaps a peaceful future that hangs in the balance in this region of unparalleled division. The reasons for this situation are very clear to see. The first is the economic imbalance. Thirteen years after the launch of the Barcelona Process, not only has the promised shared prosperity not materialised; the gaps have grown wider. In fact, the obsession with free trade has taken precedence over the goal of development. In order to succeed tomorrow where we failed yesterday, a change of direction is needed. I do not see this, however. The second problem is the humiliating treatment of migrants. The population of these countries is very young. The people want to live yet they do not see any future. Although they are deeply attached to their land, their culture, the history of their civilisation and its impressive contributions – all due respect to Mr Berlusconi – many of them are looking to Europe and they see their emigrant brothers and sisters suffering the affronts of which we are all aware: from profiling to discrimination, from detention centres to ‘refoulement’. In this regard, too, the gap has increased dramatically. Talking about a dialogue of cultures and bringing the people closer together without putting an end to these practices has absolutely no credibility whatsoever. Finally, there is Europe’s inertia regarding the Palestinian problem. There will be the retort that the Union and its Member States are Palestine’s largest donors; that is true and it is a good thing. However, any observer will confirm, as the EP delegation that has just returned from the Middle East has just done, that without a firm European commitment on a political level, this aid will resolve none of the real issues. In other words, what is expected of Europe in the Southern Mediterranean in this respect is that it finally overcomes what the former representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr de Soto, quite rightly called self-censorship with regard to Israel and the persistent violations of international law and its own commitments. Israel must understand – and it is the Union’s duty to help with this – that the normalisation of its relations with the region as a whole has a price, and that price is no more or no less than what is stipulated in the Peace Initiative of the Arab League, the Quartet’s Roadmap or the Annapolis Declaration, namely the end of the occupation and resulting barbarism, and the recognition of the Palestinian State within the borders as they stood in 1967. Europe’s attitude to this matter is perhaps the decisive criterion in the success or failure of any attempt to relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is therefore recommended that the European Union-Israel Association Council meeting on 16 June give serious consideration to this when examining the Israeli request for the status of its partnership with the Union to be upgraded.

 Mr President, Commissioner, eight years ago the Commission published a report, provided for in the 1994 directive on European Works Councils, in which it recognised that the application of this text in some cases seems – I quote – ‘to guarantee only a very low level of transnational consultation and information’. It concluded, and I quote again, that it would, ‘at the given moment decide on the possible revision of the Directive’. That was eight years ago. Four years passed and nothing happened. In 2004 the Commission finally launched the first phase of consultation with the social partners. Then another four years were lost, even though the position of all sides was well known and had not changed. According to employers’ organisations, any revision of the directive is pointless, while the trade unions believe that it is vital. I should add that the Commission itself acknowledged that in 2006, only one third of companies had set up such a Council, that 20% of the European Works Councils that did exist were only consulted after the public announcement of management decisions and that 30% were not consulted at all. During this time, there was an explosion in the number of mergers, restructurings and relocations. Finally today we are coming out of this unjustifiable hibernation. Some proposals are on the table. They are indeed so timid that BusinessEurope, which was against the revision, is delighted that they are, in its words, less prescriptive than inspirational, but at least the debate can begin. The ball is now in Parliament’s court, and Parliament does not have to start from scratch. I should recall that in 2001, our PPE fellow Member at the time, Mr Menrad, had a report adopted on the subject. It mentioned, among other requirements for the enforcement of the directive, – I quote – ‘adequate sanctions at national and European level for non-compliance with the Directive’ – specific and heavy sanctions –, the right to suspend the management’s decision at the request of employees’ representatives, and a more prominent role for the trade unions. Our Group will support taking up the proposals in the old PPE report, which gained a majority in 2001, and suggests being more specific about them, in particular on two points. Firstly, the European Works Councils must have access to strategic information about the group so that consultation is not merely a formality, and above all they must have the right to suspend any restructuring plan: not just to push back the deadline, but so they can carry out a counter-assessment, present counter-proposals and participate in real negotiations. We only have a little time. The end of this parliamentary term is approaching. I think the moment of truth has come.

 Commissioner, first of all, I would like to note for the record that my colleagues from the Conference of Presidents, who decided on a late-night debate against my wishes, are all absent this evening. Were it not for this being a late-night debate, I would be pleased to have finally initiated a discussion of this serious matter, which is the recognition by the Court of Justice of wage dumping, a matter that you just spent 20 seconds on, Commissioner, in a remarkably offhand manner. Therefore, I will briefly outline the three stages of this new dimension of European law. 11 December 2007: the Court quashed a trade union action claiming that the Finnish shipping company Viking Line should not be allowed to register its ferry in Estonia to reduce workers’ wages. 18 December 2007: the Court again found against the unions, this time in Vaxholm, Sweden, for blockading a building against a Latvian company which was refusing to observe the collective agreement applicable to the building sector. 3 April 2008: the Court found Lower Saxony in Germany guilty of imposing a minimum salary on any construction company awarded a procurement contract. The Court then found in favour of a Polish subcontractor of a German company, which was paying its workers less than half the prescribed minimum wage. This was the Rüffert ruling. In all three cases, the fundamental reason invoked by the Court to justify its decision to encourage wage dumping was that Community law prohibits any measure – take note – likely to ‘make less attractive’ the conditions of a company from another Member State because this is – and I quote – a ‘restriction on the freedom to provide services’ or the freedom of establishment, which are among the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty. This is quite simply unacceptable. Where is the social aspect of this liberal reasoning? Effectively, any social progress in a country will make a market less attractive – to use the Court’s expression – for competing companies. I should add that, in all three cases, the famous Posting of Workers Directive has not offered the slightest protection to the workers concerned. Incidentally, the Court explained that, and I quote, the ‘directive seeks in particular to bring about the freedom to provide services’. It did not mention the protection of workers. Finally, in all three cases, the Court reached its decision in the light of specific articles of the Treaty and not just the directive. These were Article 43, in the first case, and Article 49, in the two others, both being reproduced word for word in the draft Treaty of Lisbon currently in the process of ratification. My conclusion is therefore clear. Amending a directive to solve the problem posed by these rulings is not sufficient. Anyone who wants to re-establish the primacy of social rights over free trade must insist on a revision of the treaties, and specifically the articles relied on by the Court to justify its recent decisions. This is difficult, but I think that it is necessary, because otherwise we can expect a real crisis over the legitimacy of the current European economic and social model.

 Mr President, we will support any move to eradicate racism and xenophobia, promote fundamental rights and, even more so, condemn unreservedly war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide. This we will do, whatever the time or the place. In this fight, there can be no taboos, neither with regard to the crimes of the past nor in connection with the tragedies currently taking place all over the world. In terms of European history, this naturally applies to Nazism. This also applies to the fascist regimes of Mussolini, Pétain, Franco, Salazar, as it does to that of the Greek Colonels. We are also quite prepared to reiterate a radical condemnation of the atrocious crimes committed under Stalin. What happened during the colonial period must not be forgotten either. Our unwillingness to compromise must surely apply even more to the racist, xenophobic and overtly neo-fascist tendencies that are still tolerated today at a very high level in some of the Member States, both new and old, of the European Union. There is only one thing that might be deemed unacceptable, not by our group especially but by those who have made personal sacrifices in the fight against the worst genocide in modern history, and that is the attempt surreptitiously to trivialise Nazism by placing it in a generic category that includes, in particular, Stalinism and even the regimes existing in central and eastern Europe prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. I should like to quote you three statements made recently from among many more on this subject, all of which speak for themselves. Firstly, this excerpt from a statement made by the German Union of Survivors of the Neuengamme Concentration Camp. I quote:  (DE)

Next, this comment made by the Advisory Board of Former Prisoners of Buchenwald. And I quote: ‘Those who seek to generalise distort the significance of Nazi barbarism in Germany’s history.’ Finally, these words spoken by the Secretary General of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, denouncing those who venture to draw a comparison between the former GDR and the Nazi regime; and I quote: ‘Any attempt to draw a parallel between them is to diminish the magnitude of the denial of rights, deportation and mass extermination of millions of innocent men, women and children during the Nazi dictatorship.’ Thank you for devoting some thought to these statements.

Mr President, thank you for your statement. We had only just decided on this formal initiative after 110 Palestinians were killed in bomb attacks on Gaza when eight more victims, this time Israelis, were killed in Jerusalem. On each occasion we all condemned those crimes, but I agree with the earlier speaker that everyone can see that more is needed if we are to have any hope of breaking this vicious circle for good. The Union needs to be courageous enough not just to condemn all the crimes committed by both sides, but to point to the main cause of all the problems, the occupation, with its grim succession of cruelties and humiliations, never-ending sources of hatred, despair and thirst for revenge. There is thus no justification for continuing the occupation. That must be stated plainly and the appropriate conclusions drawn. A prominent Israeli peace campaigner, our friend Nurit Peled, winner of the Sakharov Prize, made that clear when she lost her child in an attack by a Palestinian. Speaking to the then Prime Minister, Mr Netanyahu, she said, 'You killed my daughter'. That 'you' referred not just to an individual but to a policy that his successors had followed and intensified. Now it is called 'the Gaza blockade', and it even goes so far as to deprive the civilian population of food and healthcare. It is also referred to more generally as 'the sealing off of towns and villages on the West Bank', 'incursions and bombings', 'targeted assassinations and mass arrests', which include children, 'further colonisation and building of the wall', 'annexation and policy of the fait accompli in Jerusalem', etc. It is prolonging the war to treat these crimes as relative and allow their perpetrators impunity. If we are to reach out to the forces of peace on both sides, we must dare to tell the truth. We must call upon the Union to take this decisive step at last.

 Mr President, it is difficult not to feel very uneasy about the responsibilities taken on by the European Union and its Member States in the Kosovo affair. Firstly, in principle the EU aims to contribute to better world governance. Yet under its impetus, several Member States have weakened or are about to weaken dangerously the future credibility of international law through their support for the unilateral declaration of independence by a province of a sovereign state, a member of the UN. Whatever is said about the sui generis
 – because that is not decreed – the EU’s major powers thus place power relations above the law, and in doing so open a Pandora’s box. This is serious. Next, this unilateral recognition is in serious danger of going against the EU’s stated objectives in the Balkans. It will fuel nationalism rather than stemming its sources. Furthermore, the EU has just deeply alienated the Serbian people, without whom any regional policy in that part of Europe is impossible. As it happens I am not talking about those who would like to have Milošević back, but those who opposed him and are now in the majority. As for the Kosovo Albanians themselves, will the EU be able to satisfy their expectations after fuelling them? It is a question worth asking, hence the third reason for the unease felt after this day of jubilation in Kosovo. The new challenge the European Union has just given itself is quite breathtaking. Here we are in the front line, heading towards a new protectorate, even though no satisfactory analysis has been produced of the reasons for the failure of the previous protectorate: Kosovo’s gross domestic product is equivalent to that of Rwanda, half of its active population is unemployed, there are more than 200 000 refugees and displaced people, and violence against minorities is on the increase, despite EUR 2 billion of international aid and the presence of 17 000 NATO troops. It will not be EULEX that sorts out all these problems. What comprehensive lasting prospect is the European Union able to offer to the Kosovars and to the other peoples of the Balkans – a prospect that can stabilise the situation here without the risk of destabilising it elsewhere? Membership? Within what timescale? Under what conditions? With what degree of probability that the necessary unanimous agreement of the 27 Member States will be secured? Nobody knows. Clearly, my group cannot associate itself with the short-term self-satisfaction of the principal European leaders. (Applause)

Mr President, Prime Minister, Madam Minister, if there is an area where Sweden’s experience is of interest to us when it comes to European policy, I think it is one which you unfortunately chose to overlook in your address, that is, the social field, and more specifically the lessons to be learnt from the Laval-Vaxholm case. Let me just run through the facts. The Swedish trade unions took industrial action to try to force a Latvian company to apply Swedish labour law in Sweden. What else would you expect, you might think – unless you are a supporter of the so-called country of origin principle, otherwise known as social dumping. However, the Latvian company relied on European law as justification for opposing the trade unions’ demands. The dispute was then brought before the courts, and was referred to the highest court in European law, the European Court of Justice, which, as we know, interprets the Treaties and establishes case-law. On 18 December last year the Court ruled in favour of the company and against the unions. The Court’s judgment states, and I quote, ‘In the case in the main proceedings, it must be pointed out that the right of trade unions […] to take collective action […] is liable to make it less attractive, or more difficult, for such undertakings to carry out construction work in Sweden, and therefore constitutes a restriction on the freedom to provide services’. In future, in such cases, the trade unions in Sweden and elsewhere must restrict their demands to, and I quote again, the ‘minimum protection’ allowed under Community law, so as not to infringe Article 49 of the Treaty, which guarantees freedom to provide services. This is clearly not acceptable, and it is why my Group is urgently calling for the European Parliament to debate this issue and its huge ramifications: what should be the political follow-up to this judgment? For the time being, however, we would be interested to hear your views on this case, Prime Minister.

Mr President, my group has proposed a debate on this for the same reasons as we have proposed that there should be a resolution in February. It is in order to have an opportunity to listen to Mr Solana and for Parliament then to explain its own position, for three reasons. The first is, of course, the issue of the Gaza blockade, which seems to us a collective punishment that is totally unacceptable from the humanitarian point of view, counter-productive politically and ineffective as far as the security of Israel is concerned. The second reason is the new situation since the people of Gaza have opened up the border. Thirdly, and above all, the European response to the question of what we can do to ensure that this opening up continues in a controlled and stable way and to make this step forward part of the peace process as a whole. I think it would be useful now to hear what Mr Solana has to say and to debate the issue and wind up the debate with a resolution in February.

Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, the heroes of Gaza have once again proven that no fortified wall can imprison the free spirit of humanity and no form of violence can subdue life. I am quoting from the speech made at the gates of Gaza last Saturday by the Israeli peace campaigner and Sakharov prizewinner Nurit Peled, who was there with other Palestinian and Israeli demonstrators. It is impossible not to sympathise with the emotion felt by this Mother Courage at the sight of these people, oppressed and humiliated to an intolerable degree, forcing their way through the blockade imposed by Israel and finally breathing fresh air, with time to find milk for the children, food for the family and a little happiness to bolster their morale. What happens now? We can all see the dual threat that is looming from the Israeli leaders. Firstly, the intention to use force to close off this small free space, or have it closed off again. The second, more general, threat is to get rid of the responsibility of the occupying power for Gaza and hand it over to Egypt. If the true words of the Council statement of 28 January are to have any real import, the European Union must agree to put more pressure on the Israeli authorities than the usual tortuous circumlocutions, directly and in the Quartet, to accept the principle of the transit points being opened up permanently, under the responsibility of the Palestinian authority and with the support of the European Union and the Arab League. If the Palestinian Authority continues to be deprived of any possibility of offering its people the slightest hope for the future and working towards the national Palestinian reconciliation that is needed, that would be to accept the worst possible scenario. I am afraid we are headed that way fast at the moment. We all know that an impetus is needed from the international community on Gaza and on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. That impetus will not come from a worn-out and discredited American president. It is up to Europe to act.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, for this first Presidency of a new Member State, Slovenia is inheriting a number of rather thankless tasks from its predecessors. Thus, as regards the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, you are required to ensure that no Member State apart from Ireland sets the bad example of organising a referendum, including countries that have made firm commitments to do so. This is to some extent like moving backwards at a time when the EU's citizens and institutions are supposed to be moving closer together. Frankly, you deserve to have been given a nobler ambition. At the social level, the Presidency will first have the difficult task of getting things moving again on two emblematic draft directives, one on working time and the sadly famous opt-out, and the other on temporary work and equal treatment of employees. Nor will it escape a substantive discussion on the action to be taken in the wake of the recent judgments by the European Court of Justice in the Laval/Vaxholm and Viking Line cases, which lend legitimacy to social dumping. My group, moreover, has requested a debate on this matter to be put on the agenda of a forthcoming parliamentary session. This brings up again the whole problem of the Bolkestein Directive and the provisions of the treaty on which it is based. In the midst of the ratification of a new text that includes all these provisions, this makes for a real muddle. Finally, again on the social level, Europe is facing increasing demands for higher pay. Indeed its share of added value has been diminishing for some decades. It has never been so low, as even the financial press are pointing out. Yet, the European Central Bank has just threatened to raise interest rates if this demand, however legitimate, is met, despite the fact that profits have never been so high, as the experts acknowledge. If we do not put this issue on the agenda, it will soon make its own way there. I recall that the joint document of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies underlines in point 68 that, I quote ‘The overarching aims of the three Presidencies will be to strengthen the European Social Model as an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy’. As the adage goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating! A word also about another sensitive subject: that of illegal migrants. In its current state, the draft directive on their return deserves the ‘outrageous directive’ label given to it by organisations that defend human rights. Adoption in its current state would cast an unkind light on the good intentions expressed by the EU in the context of intercultural dialogue. To conclude, I would like to mention the problem of Kosovo. Before any decision is made, surely it would be justified to have clarification on a three-pronged question? Firstly, how to explain the fact that two billion euros of aid from the international community have, in the space of seven years, resulted in non-existent economic development, endemic poverty, 50% unemployment, and the proliferation of corruption and mafia networks? Secondly, how to explain the fact that 17 000 NATO soldiers have proved unable to prevent the destruction of dozens of orthodox buildings, the kidnapping or murder of hundreds of Kosovar citizens from minority communities and the forced exile of thousands of others? Finally, how will the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo and the replacement of UNMIK with the European Union solve these vitally important problems while guaranteeing the stability of the Balkans? I would be curious to hear your response.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, we have just heard much self-congratulation. I think, however, that the end of an EU Council Presidency should logically also be a chance for the Heads of State or Government to make a critical assessment of their action in view of the challenges to be faced. A check-up of this kind is particularly important at a time when a financial crisis is flaring up, when mobilisation against global warming is causing a struggle, the outcome of which is uncertain, and when the international community is attempting to revive a peace process aimed at resolving the conflict that most epitomises our era. Let us start with the financial crisis. For once we are hearing the truth from a leader writer at the Financial Times
, Martin Wolf. ‘What is happening … is a huge blow to the credibility of the Anglo-Saxon model of … financial capitalism’, he writes. When will the European Council have such a burst of lucidity? More generally, is this really the moment to be pushing free competition to the detriment of employment safeguards and trade union rights, as two alarming judgments by the Court of Justice – the Viking Line case and, more scandalously still, the Vaxholm case – have just illustrated? Is it by going into a downward spiral on employment rights that the EU plans to deal with the challenge of globalisation? Do you believe that Europeans will, in the long term, accept this unravelling of what they have gained, in the name of the free market and the holy grail of competition? You are too easily reassured, Mr Barroso. One opinion poll does not announce confidence any more than one swallow makes a summer. Next, the climate. Europe claims to be at the forefront of this battle, and in fact the targets set by the 27 Member States for reducing emissions are on the right lines. But what happens to concrete measures, the moment the industrial lobbies get to work on the decision-making of the EU's highest authorities? We will have a clearer idea tomorrow, when the Commission presents its new standards for carbon dioxide emissions for cars. Finally, assistance to Palestine. Well done for the financial commitment – provided that it is adhered to, of course. But where is the EU’s political commitment? What about the clear need for the removal of 550 military roadblocks, for the end of the blockade of Gaza, for the effective freeze on settlement in the West Bank, for the release of prisoners, for an end to the humiliation? When will we see an end to the self-censorship with regard to the occupier, to use the terms of the report by Mr de Soto, the former UN representative in the Middle East? These are three areas, among others, in which the credibility of the European project could be won or lost.

Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, the forthcoming European Council will take place in the context of the signature of a new treaty, immediately after a particularly important EU-Africa summit and also – let us not forget – during the first phase of implementation of the Annapolis process. On the treaty, I believe the Union would be seriously misreading the situation if it thought that this summit agreement marked the end of the crisis of confidence which has dislocated entire sections of our societies from the current thrust of Union economic and social policies. That problem remains intact. We would do better to recognise it and prepare responses to it. A similar reality check seems necessary in terms of our relations with Africa. The Chair of the African Union Commission, Alpha Konaré, has called on Europe to break with paternalism. He emphasised that Africa ‘could not remain a hunting ground or become a new territory to be conquered’. He lambasted – and I quote again – ‘the logic of the Economic Partnership Agreements with their dramatic costs for the African people’. Significantly, seven Latin American countries created the Bank of the South almost on the same day as the summit, as a means of emancipating themselves from the IMF and of lessening inequalities in their region. The European Union needs to learn from that and take the measure of this general and growing demand for a fairer, more dignified partnership, including in its way of treating migrants. Finally, the Middle East, which is apparently missing from the Council agenda: how could the Union agree in Annapolis to be completely sidelined from the structure responsible for implementation of the Roadmap? Does it intend to stand by and passively watch the agreement being violated – as was the case last week with the affair of the East Jerusalem settlements? Generally speaking, what are our true aspirations for Europe and what resources are we prepared to invest in realising them? This is a priority question for the next European Council.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express – both in a personal capacity and I hope, given what we witnessed, on behalf of my entire group – the strongest possible condemnation of the disgraceful, chauvinist, anti-European demonstration that was staged here earlier today. (Applause)
 My group is certainly in favour of a referendum on the new treaty and it has questions and misgivings about certain articles of the Charter. But all that is quite unrelated to what took place here this morning and it is important that there should be no confusion. For our part, we support a Community of values, we support the promotion of fundamental rights, we support a Europe of democracy and there is no place in our vision for chauvinism and bad behaviour!

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during our next sitting we will again approve the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Before we do this, let me ask a question which is perhaps not as simple as it appears. Will this be the initial Charter proclaimed in the year 2000 or, as the Leinen report suggests, will it be the adapted rehash integrated within the former draft Constitutional Treaty? The two texts are not, of course, identical and I feel it is unfortunate that their differences are not clearly set out, although that would have raised some legitimate controversy. For example, the French human rights commission expressed, and I quote, its grave concern about the amendments made to the articles on social rights – I am still quoting – that threaten to remove the social content of the Charter. One of the main authors of the original Charter, the lawyer Guy Braibant, explained in the press – and I quote – that the conditions for applying the text have changed. First of all, the word ‘may’ is occasionally replaced by ‘must’. Moreover – and I am still quoting – there is an official reference to ‘explanations’ by the Presidium. Although they ought to be pedagogical and completely neutral, the explanations interpret laws in a rather minimal sense. Fundamental rights have been undermined, unquote. Which text will we be approving in the next sitting? I also have a subsidiary question: will this approval be valid in all EU countries? This kind of action cannot entertain any ambiguity. Thus I would appreciate a precise reply to these two questions.

 Mr President, Prime Minister, you made a fine speech. In many respects it was a humanist speech which I am willing to accept as an ideal for the Europe of the future. However, we must admit that, for the current reality of Europeans to resemble the vision you have just described, many changes must be made to the procedures and structures of the European Union. You say that our Europe is a social Europe. Bravo! It is not, however, pessimistic to say that in the main this social Europe has yet to be built. The current framework of European social policy is, according to the Treaties, an open market economy with free competition. This is a framework that naturally encourages competition between social models and naturally tends to diminish our entitlements in the name of competitiveness. This is a framework that naturally pushes down the cost of manpower, encourages job insecurity and undermines social rights. The social issue is undoubtedly the main reason for our citizens’ distrust of European institutions. The President of the European Central Bank, for instance, saw this for himself when he spoke recently at the European Trade Union Confederation Conference, putting forward his theory, the official EU theory, on wage moderation in the name of competitive prices. He encountered unanimous opposition. I have already said that the German Finance Minister mentioned the risk of a crisis of legitimacy in the European social and economic model. Let us, therefore, take a look at these aspects, precisely to give some credibility to your vision of the future. You also mentioned relations with Africa and the need to provide a response to their calls for justice. You are right. However, in that case, for instance, we must come back to the draft economic partnership agreement which has been rejected by all our African partners because they feel sure – and I think they are right – that development of human capacities and free trade are not a good mix. To end, Prime Minister, I wish to thank you for reminding us of what I feel to be Europe’s ultimate objectives, and if we still cannot agree as to our view of the present, let us at least agree as to the future prospects.

 Mr President, I think I do not need to add much to what Monica Frassoni, Graham Watson and Martin Schulz have said. I would simply like to say this: it would be sensible, when any Commissioner has his words challenged by four groups who are not all from the same half of the Chamber, for him to reflect on what he should avoid doing again if he wants to have Parliament’s trust. (Applause)

Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with my fellow Members I listened closely to what Mr Barroso said. He set out the Commission’s strategic objectives, with growth and employment naturally being at the top of the list of priorities. Nevertheless, I noted that, as in the communication from the Commission, there was something singularly missing from his presentation and I would now like to ask the Commission President quite specifically about this. Is it true that on 23 October the College of Commissioners debated a proposal that had been put by Mr Mandelson concerning European firms and businesses that had moved their production to third countries where wage levels were low? This proposal was possibly aimed at exempting the said companies from the anti-dumping duties that apply to products exported to the Union at prices that are significantly lower than their normal value. Is it true that this proposal received a large measure of support and that the Commission is to take a formal decision on this subject after 5 December? How do you respond to those who see in such a measure nothing more than a financial subsidy for relocating production? Would such a move not be totally inconsistent with those sections of the Commission communication that we are discussing here today, including the following:   Recent research shows that the main concern for EU citizens is ‘the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation (in particular jobs and the fear of unemployment).’ Or else: ‘The global competitiveness agenda contributes to creating lasting growth and jobs at home.’  (FR) 
Why was there no mention either in your presentation or in the Commission communication of the legislative programme for 2008 or of any project relating to major political issues such as the promotion of employment in the EU, industrial policy and, more generally, the benefits that the Community can derive from the current phenomenon of globalisation? Finally, is it true that, foreseeing the major disruption that such a subject could cause during a vote in Parliament, not to say in the Council, you are planning to bypass the legislators by opting for guidelines instead? I believe that my Group is not the only one here hoping for a clear response from you to these questions, failing which each of us will have to consider what form of reaction would be the most appropriate. If you enjoyed the manner in which the House mobilised its efforts against the Bolkestein Directive then you will certainly love the outcry that will be caused by the Mandelson Regulation.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, General de Gaulle said of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing: ‘His problem is the people’. This statement would apply rather well to the European Council today. Once again, at the summit, the 27 Member States showed themselves to be very adept at horse-trading. The Prévert-style inventory of concessions granted to all the recalcitrant Member States deserves a mention. This is the cost of getting everyone to agree, from the descendents of the EU’s founding fathers to the most inveterate Euro sceptics. In the end, only two or three things seem untouchable, and in the European Council nobody has thought of touching them. For example, the restrictive framework that the European Union’s economic and social policies must fit into: an open market economy with free competition, the issue of credit by the European Central Bank, the orientations of the Stability Pact, strict respect for freedom of movement of capital, the gradual removal of everything investors consider a barrier to trade, and the concentration of key powers in the institutions, which are inaccessible to citizens, national parliaments and even governments themselves, particularly in smaller countries, and indeed the dimensions assumed by military aspects in the European Union’s foreign policy. These are ‘red lines’, as they say in English, which must not be crossed according to the EU’s ruling circles. The problem is that it is precisely at these issues that most of the questions and criticisms from our people are directed, and it is the persistent absence of answers to these questions, the repeated refusal to hear these criticisms, that is fuelling the crisis of confidence that the European Union is suffering from among our fellow citizens. Furthermore, if the members of the European Council had opened the windows of their meeting room on 18 October, they would have been able to measure the strength of this disaffection in person, as expressed on the streets of Lisbon by the largest demonstration seen in Portugal in the last 20 years, and I think that neither Mr Sócrates nor Mr Barroso will contradict me on this point. The ultimate challenge for the European Union – we read in the Commission Communication at the Lisbon summit – is to explain to citizens what the European Union represents for Europeans. Always explaining, never taking account. Always communicating, never having open debates and therefore, with greater reason, not having referendums. Yes, the European Council’s problem is the people, but without the people there would be no future for a great European ambition. Surely this question really deserves to be discussed openly one day? That is what I am asking you.

 Mr President, I will not go over our group's general assessment of the new draft Treaty again. We oppose it, not through nationalism, Mr Schulz, which is something I despise as much as you do, but because none of the basic criticisms that characterised the debates on the old draft Constitutional Treaty – and I am not talking about the symbols of the EU, which we did not have a problem with, but the EU's political thrust – have been taken into consideration. I get the impression we will pay for this casual approach sooner or later. Just now, I want to dwell on one specific article of the new draft, which we have already talked about: Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union. There seems to be a broad consensus among us on challenging this, and that is a good thing. It is, in fact, a sensitive issue: the protection of citizens with regard to the processing of personal data. Now, the legislative procedure that would apply would not be the same depending on whether these data were being processed within the European Union or sent to a third country. In the former case, Parliament would have full competence, but in the latter it would have no say at all. This is a legal monstrosity and a serious denial of democracy. In fact, it relates directly to the precedent set by the PNR case, where the Council agreed to send the US authorities confidential data on passengers travelling to the United States, despite complete opposition from the European Parliament. The Council would like to continue with this situation, and is giving itself the means to do so. This is unacceptable and Parliament should signal this clearly to the European Council. I will simply add this: this dispute indirectly reveals several facts to which my group has constantly drawn attention. The first is the little real impact the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have. In fact, Article 8 of the Charter is devoted explicitly to the protection of personal data, yet this protection is cheerfully violated and will be violated in future too. Next there is the almost indecipherable nature of some key passages of the treaties, only a very well-informed reading of which reveals this kind of trap. Finally, there is the deliberate opacity of the work of the IGC, which is as far as it could be from a public, transparent drafting of a text whose purpose is to determine the life and future of the EU of 27 and half a billion citizens. All this confirms our demand for democracy on two fronts, on the one hand for a major pluralist debate in each country on what is at stake in the treaties, and on the other for ratification by referendum.

Mr President, I welcome the fact that my colleagues in the Conference of Group Presidents have agreed to my proposal to ask the Commission to make a statement to us before any decision is taken on the future of the Gdansk shipyards. The Directorate-General for Competition did not need this new case to illustrate its thinking. It has already attracted so much protest that many observers who can hardly be suspected of anti-liberalism have themselves regarded it as dogmatic for some time. In this instance, a restructuring plan is only seen as convincing if it provides for 1 000 workers to be laid off. There are plenty of previous examples of companies in difficulties being told to axe hundreds of jobs, failing which they will have to pay back the aid they need to survive. In the present case, tell us what shipyard operates without subsidies. I do not think there is any question that the award of subsidies has to be subject to conditions. But the problem is that those conditions always involve heavy sacrifices for the workers. In that respect, although the successive Competition Commissioners I have known are not usually noted for their soul-searching and social fibre is clearly not one of their attributes, this time the leading directorate-general of the Commission has gone even further by showing that it is as indifferent to political issues as to social problems. By threatening the very existence of this place that is so emblematic of Poland, is the Commission considering the political implications of the message it is sending the people of this new Member State, barely three years after its accession? That is apparently the least of the worries of the guardians of free and undistorted competition. They think there is a time to celebrate the key role of the Gdansk shipyard workers in the freedom struggle – a historic role, as Mr McCreevy said – and another time to impose the iron laws of the free market on them. There is still time to stop this irresponsible action. The first step, in my view, is to start substantive talks with the Polish trade unions, indeed with the European Federation of Metalworkers. What is needed is to clarify the real amount of aid paid to these shipyards and, above all, to find a solution that avoids job losses. Apart from that, this new case, which highlights to the point of absurdity the narrowness of the criteria now applied in the name of preventing distortions of competition, reinforces the view of my group that, before any final decision is taken on the future European treaty, it is vital to have a thorough, public and wide-ranging debate on the aims of the Union and whether these are consistent with the policies put into operation. The story of the Gdansk shipyards is a reminder that a political structure that proves unable to face up to its own contradictions and progress beyond them is doomed. That lesson is still just as relevant today and some European leaders would do well to reflect on it.

Mr President, I can understand that the EU leaders are enthusiastic about the idea of seeing their old Constitution revived, even if it has been deprived of some of its assets. In this regard, I agree with what Mr Voggenhuber just said. What I find more difficult to understand is why, at a time when these very leaders appear so set on fulfilling our fellow citizens’ most earnest desires, they put so much effort into preventing them from getting too close to this institutional UFO. How else can we interpret the very specific form of democracy that characterises the process under way? There is a negotiation mandate that is totally unreadable for the uninitiated, a suspicious speeding up of the timetable and, above all, panic at the idea of any referendums. Deep down, our leaders are no doubt saying to themselves that the act of changing the words – constitution, ministers, law – and of deleting the references to the anthem and the flag would be unlikely to carry much weight faced with the people’s concerns about the current European model if, by any chance, a fundamental public debate of the level and force of that which rocked one part of the Union two years ago – and for good reason – were to resurface. In the future treaty, liberal economic structures, whether they affect the European Central Bank, competition, free trade or the movement of capital, will remain for the most part unchanged. Not only will the Charter of Fundamental Rights, of which mention was just made, still have serious gaps, but it is required to endorse a situation that totally contradicts everything that it stands for, to endorse an exception, which, in this instance, is a British exception, or, if you prefer, the right to discrimination, the right to privileges. Finally, the new provisions on security and defence policy, which in many areas had fuelled numerous doubts and fears, have all been replicated. We need look no further for the obvious difficulties faced by our respective governments. In Spain and in Luxembourg, they are going to explain that a new municipal referendum is unnecessary given that the substance of the already ratified treaty has been preserved in its entirety. In France and in Sweden, on the other hand, the government will suggest that a referendum is no longer relevant since the nature of the text has profoundly changed. As for Denmark and Portugal, where a citizens’ vote was planned, the cosmetic tidy-up operation performed on the 2004 treaty may well justify a cowardly renouncement of this test of truth. It is only in Ireland that the referendum is, today, as it was yesterday, crucial. That is why, by fully respecting the differences of opinion and the specific national situations, my group is going to show the same determination as it has in the recent past and make a huge effort to provide information, to clarify the issues at stake and to compare ideas about the content of the future treaty with the same, EU-wide, democratic demand: that the people of Europe be consulted in practice. In a few days’ time, the Intergovernmental Conference will begin its work but, with the benefit of experience, I am convinced that the die has not been cast: it will be soon. (Applause from the left)

Mr President, Commissioner, my colleague, Erik Meijer, will go back over the report by Mr Ferber. For my part, I should like to give some actual illustrations, starting with this case of the draft directive and the Commission’s attitude with regard to it, of the liberal dogmatism that feeds the crisis of legitimacy in the European economic and social model and the arrogance that maintains the climate of defiance towards our institutions. I recall what the European Trade Union Confederation said, from the beginning, about your draft proposal, Mr McCreevy. I quote: ‘This proposal will eliminate the reserved area sector which has proved to be the only reliable service’. It continues and again, I quote: ‘Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost since the liberalisation was launched. In the long run, this will have a far-reaching and negative impact on the European Union. The European Trade Union Confederation urges the Council and Parliament not to adopt the Commission’s proposal’. For its part, the UNI-Europe postal network, which represents more than a million employees, considers, I quote: ‘That the Commission’s proposal would jeopardise the extent, the quality and the access to services currently enjoyed by European citizens’. It also – I am still quoting – ‘unanimously urges the Council and Parliament to reject the Commission’s proposal’ which has, according to the network’s General Secretary, I quote: ‘failed to guarantee the financing of the universal postal service for the citizen’. It is clear! Furthermore, tens of thousands of petitions from users opposing this bad text have been sent directly to the Commission. For their part, nine of the incumbent postal operators have laid stress on the threat that is hanging over the future financing of the universal service. Better still, according to Luxembourg’s Minister for Communications, Mr Jean-Louis Schiltz, a majority of Member States have problems with the rules laid down for financing the public service if this directive is applied. The Commission’s answer to this avalanche of questioning is that its directive is the only realistic option. End of story. That is precisely, Mr President, what is no longer acceptable to public opinion and likewise on our authority it is no longer acceptable to the greatest possible number of Members of the European Parliament. That is the meaning of our amendment calling for rejection, whether it be for 2009 or later. I will see you tomorrow for the vote.

Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, my group will have the opportunity to return in detail to the various important dimensions of the future treaty that you mentioned. I should like to confine myself today to just one issue that the President-in-Office of the Council has not mentioned. What, in practice, is going to change the decision taken by the 27 to withdraw free and undistorted competition from the list of the EU's objectives? Because one of two things is true: either the European leaders believe that this is merely a communications exercise designed to reassure, at little cost, the people of Europe, a growing number of whom see this obsession with competition as one of the reasons for the erosion of the social acquis
, for the rapid growth in job insecurity and, vice versa, for the explosion in dividends; or this is a serious matter and, therefore, we absolutely must know what its practical implications are. Those behind the first theory have solid arguments to draw on. Firstly, the framework principle of an open market economy in which there is free competition appears on numerous occasions in the parts of the current treaty that will be replicated as they stand. Secondly, a protocol specially devoted to reaffirming competition policy has been adopted by the European Council itself and will be included in the final text. Finally, some of the provisions of the treaty that are based on the principle in question have not been amended in any way whatsoever. It follows, then, that, despite the impact made by the European Council, there will be nothing new under the sun in this regard. If there is nothing new, I believe that this will be a case of disgraceful deceit on the part of the Heads of State or Government who, in the eyes of many of our fellow citizens, are still pushing for a pluralist public debate on the future treaty as a whole, or the double treaty as a whole, a debate that would culminate in an EU-wide referendum. I shall therefore listen very carefully to your explanations on this subject, Mrs Merkel. What is going to change in relation to free competition, and will these changes affect the substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty or not? In any case, I call on all those who are sensitive to this issue to take the European leaders at their word: free competition is not your aim – let us see if it is not! The first, imminent, test will be the fate in store for the draft directive on the opening up to competition of all postal services. In countries such as Sweden, in which this liberalisation is under way, it clearly has unfavourable consequences for employment and social and territorial cohesion, two areas that remain objectives of the Union. Logically, then, this directive should be withdrawn or rejected. Let us meet in July for this test of truth.

Mr President, in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in the Palestinian territories, appeals for the violence to cease are completely ineffective if we refuse to see how this predictable catastrophe came into being. This unprecedented explosion of violence is, firstly and above all, the product of those other acts of violence arising from 40 years of military occupation. It is the fruit of the impunity granted by the entire international community to the Israeli leaders, whoever they are and whatever they do, in utter disregard of international law. This violence is the price to be paid for the loss of all hope of a Palestinian State worthy of the name. What a heavy responsibility that is, then, for European leaders! Europe, it is said, is the chief donor. All very well, but what is the point of giving aid if we allow the deadly poison of permanent humiliation to spread? The situation in Gaza grotesquely illustrates this, and the continuing isolation of Gaza could only push it to the extreme. What a responsibility to have ruined historic opportunities such as the Arab League peace plan since 2002, the success of the first democratic process in Palestine in 2006 or, more recently, the establishment of a last-chance national unity government, all by aligning ourselves with the deadly strategy of the White House! There are a certain number of us here, who raised cries of alarm time after time. The most recent being an appeal by more than 100 Members of the European Parliament to put an end to a policy that, through government boycotts and the withdrawal of direct aid, nurtures the despair of a nation on the point of imploding. We were answered with reassuring words about the intentions of the Quartet, that illusion manipulated by the Bush administration to cover up its non-intervention. Here, however, we have the UN special envoy to the Middle East delivering, in person, a clear indictment of all those, Europeans included, who practise what he calls ‘self-censorship’ with regard to the occupier and whose recent decisions to boycott and to freeze aid have had, he insists, devastating consequences. This historic failure and this repudiation on the part of the chief UN representative in the region call for a special debate at the highest level. From now on, if we no longer wish to make ourselves party to a new Iraq, we must demand, as a matter of utmost urgency, fundamental strategic revisions underpinned by the international law that should have been imposed on everyone for the last 40 years. History will be our judge.

Madam President, in the report by our fellow Members, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, we read, in recital H, with regards to the French and Dutch rejection of the draft Constitutional Treaty, the following words: ‘many of the misgivings expressed related to the context, rather than the content, and the issues of major public concern have since been resolved’. That is what is called reassuring oneself on the cheap. The conclusion from such a diagnosis is obvious. It is stated in the first paragraph and I quote: ‘reaffirms its endorsement of the content of the Constitutional Treaty’. Of course, the report intends to take into account the difficulties that have arisen in certain Member States, but paragraph 6 makes abundantly clear the extent of the concessions that it could agree to when it reaffirms, and I quote, ‘its commitment to achieving a settlement of the ongoing constitutional process of the European Union, that is based on the content of the Constitutional Treaty, possibly under a different presentation’. The similarity of this approach to that suggested in one of the 12 questions that Mrs Merkel addressed last month to the Heads of State or Government is striking. Remember, I quote: ‘what do you think about the proposal to change the wording without changing the substance?’ These three extracts from Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok’s report sum up perfectly the reasons for my group’s disagreement with the text proposed to us. It is no service to Europe to hide from the increasing problems raised by a fundamental part of the acquis communautaire
 among our citizens, that is, some of the implications of what our Treaties call the open market economy where competition is free. Three examples: on 22 May last, at the congress of the European Trade Union Confederation, the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, was able to confirm the truth of this to his cost when his argument for pay restraint in the name of price competitiveness in an open economy was unanimously rejected. A few days earlier, Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner, had a similar experience, this time at the Council, where more and more government representatives asked for privatisation of postal services to be postponed in view of the general public outcry aroused by this draft directive. There again, also, a few days ago, 10 industrial associations that are very vulnerable to global competition accused the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, of showing free trade zeal with, I quote, ‘unacceptable consequences’. It is, no doubt, this avalanche of protests that the German Minister for the Economy and Finance, Mr Steinbrück, must have had in mind when he spoke recently of, I quote, ‘a risk of the European economic and social model suffering a crisis of legitimacy’. That is why my group is arguing resolutely in favour of, first of all, a very open public debate about what needs to change in the orientation and structures of the Union, and then for a ratification of the future European Treaty by means of a referendum.

Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, my group was very keen to hold this debate, particularly today, 40 years after the start of a war to which the international community, including the European Union, has shown itself to this day incapable of imposing the only just and lasting solution, that is, an end to the occupation, to the colonisation, to the oppression by Israel of the Palestinian territories conquered in 1967. Mr President, I welcomed, in their form and substance, the strong words you spoke about this in the Knesset on 30 May. I particularly remember three key sentences from your speech. You stated that, ‘international law is binding on us all’. You are right. We ask no more of Israel than that it should respect the Security Council resolutions, the Geneva Conventions, the opinions of the International Court of Justice and humanitarian law, as the United Nations Organisation (UNO) has just pointed out. The violations of the law are flagrant, constant and massive. They are in relation to settlements, refugees, prisoners, the wall and, primarily of course, the occupation of the territories and the annexation of East Jerusalem. You have also pointed out, Mr President, that, I quote: ‘a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders is and remains the only way to a satisfactory solution’. It is a fundamental truth. The multiplication of settlements, the construction of the wall, the isolation of Palestinian areas of Jerusalem, however, serve precisely to make this solution impossible. The Israeli authorities’ disregard for the Arab League’s peace plan confirms this strategy of making things worse. You have rightly reminded us, Mr President, of this obvious fact: there is no peace without justice. The famous Israeli historian, Tom Segev, recently echoed the thoughts of those of his compatriots who, for 40 years, have believed that, I quote, ‘in 1967, Israel laid the foundations for future terrorism’. Great men of State, such as Yitzhak Rabin, understood this, but the Israeli peace forces, who are a credit to that country, are marginalised by the current regime. The conclusion to be drawn from this tragic experience of 40 years of blindness is, in the opinion of my group, as follows: laisser faire
 amounts to us making ourselves guilty. Let us dare to stand up for truth. I quote your words one last time, Mr President, you said, ‘let us have the courage to make a new start together’. (Applause from the left)

Mr President, I should like to make three brief comments. The first does not concern Mr Prodi directly, but rather the famous twelve questions put by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the Heads of State or Government. One of them is worded as follows, and I quote: ‘What do you think of the proposal (...) to change the terminology without changing the legal substance, for example, regarding the name of the Treaty?’ How do you expect any citizen, upon reading that, not to say to himself that the European leaders are taking him for a complete fool, to put it mildly? More fundamentally, Mr Prodi emphasised just now that European electors have to know what the role of the European Parliament will be, if there will or will not be a stable Presidency of the European Council and a European foreign minister, and how the Commission will be constituted. All of these issues are indeed important. But do you not hear other, much stronger and more significant questions being asked around you, questions to which none of you ever reply? For example, even neo-liberal economists are asking where, in the current world context, a policy of unbridled free trade associated with free movement of capital and total freedom to relocate production facilities as well as total freedom of movement for foreign investors, including the most predatory ones, is in danger of leading us to. What changes do you propose to the Community acquis in this regard? Other voices, and not the least important ones, are being raised against the tax wars that the Member States are waging, or in favour of a change to the statutes of the European Central Bank or yet again in favour of a controlled industrial policy in key sectors of the modern economy, outside the rules of free competition. What kind of break with the status quo do you consider desirable or acceptable from this point of view? Does Europe have to be about the marketplace or about politics in relation to the market? To what extent does democracy end where the reign of the open market economy or free competition begins? These questions are on the table. What do you think about them? One last word to Mr Barroso, who is not here today, but who expressed his delight at what he considers the victory of the ‘yes’ vote during the French elections. This is a delusion. There is no doubt that the new French President supports the ‘yes’ vote. That is why he, like you, feared a new referendum. But the commitments he had to make on Europe in order to make acceptable his refusal to re-consult the citizens say a lot about the persisting depth of anti-liberal ambitions in that country. We will be able to remind him in particular of the keynote speech he made on this issue on 21 February right here in Strasbourg, entitled ‘I want Europe to change’. The real question is this: other than institutional innovations, what changes are you ready for? (Applause)

 Mr President, I am not entirely opposed to the request. Admittedly, I regret that we cannot have a resolution and that we cannot adopt the very constructive resolution on which the Conference of Presidents reached an agreement on Wednesday. I do, however, understand Mr Swoboda’s argument. If I express a few regrets, it is simply because this is exactly the message that we need, so that we can address it to this people and give it back a bit of hope and breathe a bit of life back into what remains of its very fragile institutions. I am therefore in favour of Mr Swoboda’s proposal, but I propose that the Conference of Presidents examine calmly, on Thursday, how we might mark the 40th anniversary of Resolution 242, since the mini-session will coincide exactly with this 40th anniversary. I suggest that the consensus that we have managed to build together on this major issue at the Conference of Presidents should also be formalised on the occasion of this 40th anniversary.

Mr President, what exactly does the transatlantic economic partnership have in store for us? According to Mrs Merkel, it will not mean free trade or a common market, but the regulation of markets, the protection of patents, the harmonisation of rules and cooperation aimed at improving the world’s economic governance. Her Secretary of State, Mr Würmeling, was more direct in stating that the aim was to move in the direction of an unrestricted transatlantic market. The Chancellor herself did, incidentally, imply that the experiment of the European single market could serve as a model for this new area. Do I need to remind you of the definition of this single market provided by the Commissioner in charge of monitoring it, Mr McCreevy? As he pointed out, the single market ‘is by far the greatest deregulation exercise in Europe’s recent history’. Is it indeed this experiment, then, that we should replicate across the Atlantic? The question deserves all the more to be asked because this project already has a turbulent history. It was in March 1998 that the then figurehead of liberal Europe, Commissioner Leon Brittan, launched the New Transatlantic Market project, modelled on the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. At the same time, top secret negotiations were taking place at the OECD on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the MAI, which was already designed to track down any legislation perceived by investors as an obstacle to their ever-expanding financial operations. These two projects caused such an outcry among Europeans that they had to be abandoned. Since then, however, lobbies such as the Transatlantic Business Dialogue have continually brought this strategic project up for discussion, albeit in a new form. The adoption, last year, of the US accounting standards and, more recently, the buyout of the European Euronext exchange by the New York Stock Exchange are part of this disturbing trend. Far from the image of constructive cooperation being sold to us, we are indeed talking here about a major front in the battle over the way in which Europe’s future is to be conceived. What are at stake are both Europe’s model of society and its democratic identity. I would point out that the report adopted on this subject last June by our Parliament regretted that ‘the EU-US relationship is overshadowed to a considerable extent by political conflict and is quite often characterised by rhetoric’. For the sake of the common values of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, are we going to have to keep quiet about the war in Iraq or about Guantanamo? About the death penalty or the International Criminal Court? About Kyoto or GMOs? About personal data, the SWIFT affair, or CIA flights? At a time when the process designed to lead to a new European treaty is under way, the nature of the relations between the European Union and the United States is a crucial issue that will need to be handled with great clarity.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, I shall confine myself to a single subject, but one that is of vital importance: the Middle East. Even a few weeks ago, there was reason to fear the worst, given the complete political deadlock over an occupation that had become intolerable for the Palestinian people and given the looming prospect of civil war. This appalling danger was averted, not – I am sorry to say – through the efforts of the international community, including the European Union. Instead, the embargo decided on by the Quartet only caused the victims further distress and stirred up the extremists. The fact is, we owe the unexpected gleam of hope to the authors of the prisoners’ document, in particular Marouane Barghouti, to – as you have said - the tireless efforts of President Mahmoud Abas, to the concerted action of all the Palestinian democratic forces and in addition – as you have also said – to the renewed diplomatic initiatives taken by the Arab countries. The outcome is there to be seen. The Mecca agreement has opened the way to setting up the government of national unity. Moreover, an eminent representative of these democratic forces, who is now a minister in this government – Mr Bassam al Salhi, General Secretary of the Palestinian People’s Party – is right now doing us the honour of visiting the European Parliament. He is following our debates from the gallery, and I should like to greet him and, through him, the whole of this government of unity. (Applause)
 This government agreement was made on the basis of wide-ranging political commitments on the part of the government as a whole. These commitments, which reflect the conditions of the Quartet, unfortunately have no equivalents on the Israeli side. In my - indeed, in our – opinion and, I think, in that of many of my fellow Members, it would be a serious mistake, Mr Solana, not to seize this opportunity to foster renewed hope. We therefore call on the European Union to resume giving direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, to recognise the new government of national unity and, from its position within the Quartet, to argue in favour of such recognition. This request is at the heart of an appeal by Members of the European Parliament, the initial signatories to which represent a very broad political spectrum and in many cases assume sizeable responsibilities in relation to what is at stake in the Middle East. In the hope, Mr Solana, that, following the adoption of the Berlin Declaration, the 27 will be keen to give practical expression to their ambition to constitute a world player in the service of peace, I have the honour of straightaway forwarding to you the text of this appeal.
 Francis Wurtz,

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the fact that the Union has decided to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its construction is not only normal, in my opinion, but may also prove useful, since we are seizing this opportunity to look clearly at the progress made and are learning inevitably contradictory lessons from this experience. On the other hand, if this anniversary were to take the form of a simple celebration of a jubilee designed to extol all the decisions that governed the EU’s construction and to glorify all of its results, without distinction, then, as far as historical analyses are concerned, it would be of very little importance and, in terms of political effectiveness, it would be a complete waste of time. Well, all the signs are that the famous Berlin Declaration, in the spirit of its initiators, opts for the latter, starting with the method used to draft it: where there should have been a consultation that was largely open to the citizens, it was decided that leaders would debate more or less behind closed doors. In my view, this is a mistake. A second element concerns the very substance of the declaration. It would seem, in actual fact, that what is in store for us is a very general text, focusing on an inevitably brilliant and exemplary review of 50 years of European integration, on naturally very generous common values and on inevitably ambitious objectives, particularly in the social sphere. Do you really believe that the reality experienced by our fellow citizens is as flawless as that? For my part, I firmly believe that no debate whatsoever on Europe will have a real impact today if it is not accompanied by a good dose of criticism regarding the causes of the crisis of confidence that has been raging for some years now in virtually all circles of public opinion and throughout the European institutions. It is no longer just my group that is finding this. It is eminent political officials involved in overseeing the Union’s affairs who, in private or in small groups, recognise that a problem exists, between Europe as it is developing today and Europeans. The last such person to recognise this was none other than your colleague, Mr President, the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, Mr Steinbrück, who recently referred to the risk – I quote – ‘of a crisis of legitimacy of the European economic and social model’, and he is right. We therefore need to talk about this if we are to restore meaning to the great European adventure. Thus, because I want the Union to provide itself with the means to come out of this crisis on top, I, together with my group, call for a shake-up, so that, when we come to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, talk will turn to the changes needed to pave the way for a genuine revival of the European project. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, former Presidents who remind me of many times spent together, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is not often that we have a chance to take a step back and enjoy the opportunity that is given us today, however briefly, to exchange views on the entire period between now and the next European elections. True, it is no secret that my group does not share the political options of the majority of this Parliament. I will nevertheless deliberately use some of the key points of your speech to make several specific proposals. They are limited measures with nothing revolutionary about them, and I sincerely think you do not necessarily have to sympathise with the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to identify with them. If the President of the European Parliament simply took them into account that would send a positive signal to important sections of our public opinion; it would say that you have heard them. Thus, referring to the aspirations of Europe’s citizens, Mr President, you stressed and I quote: ‘we must preserve the European social model’ and, more importantly, you went on to say ‘our acts must be convincing’. That is in fact essential if we are to dispel a deep malaise that is being fed by the idea that instead of protecting the citizens from the effects of today’s globalisation the European Union is too often helping to make everyone’s existence increasingly insecure. A significant act to begin to dispel this feeling of inevitability would be welcome. I suggest, Mr President, that you call on the Council, Commission and Parliament to abandon a proposal for a directive that affects the entire population of the European Union and that seems so dogmatic, so unjustified and so devastating for the future of public services that it is likely to provoke a new Bolkestein effect if nothing changes in the next few months; I am speaking of the proposal to liberalise postal services on 1 January 2009, six months before the next elections. More generally, you stressed another idea which I consider very right and very important. You say we need ‘a new pact between the citizens and the institutions of the European Union’, then, about the future European treaty, you say: ‘we need a thoroughgoing reform of the European Union’. Everyone agrees this is necessary, but opinions on the substance of the future European basic law differ. Mr Barroso has just addressed the Netherlands, saying to them: please help us, everyone has to move. I am suggesting to you a method that will allow everyone to move, to help relaunch Europe. Let the process which is starting be an opportunity for a real public debate across the Union, a candid debate, as close to the citizens as possible, on the meaning of Europe 50 years after the Treaty of Rome, on the purpose of our common policies, on the commitments we are prepared to assume together in the future. If the President of Parliament sets himself the task of bringing such an initiative to fruition, he will instantly have fulfilled his mandate. Finally, Mr President, you made some apt remarks about intercultural dialogue and more particularly the Middle East, where you hope to go as soon as possible, you said. That does not surprise me, and I thank you for it. With this in mind, of all the initiatives I would like the President of Parliament to take, the most symbolic in my view, following the almost unhoped-for Mecca agreement, in which the whole of Hamas promises to comply with the international resolutions and the agreements signed between the PLO and Israel, would be to solemnly call on the European Union to lift the blockade on the Palestinian Government and to give a new chance to the hope for a just peace in a region that has been bruised by occupation and war for several generations. I know that none of these initiatives will be easy to take, Mr President, but if you do, they are such that history will remember them.

Mr President, if my memory serves me correctly, the Conference of Presidents objected to the report being referred to committee. However, if I have correctly understood what Mr Corbett just said, this is a different matter. If I have understood him correctly, he is proposing not to submit to the vote amendments that received an extremely low number of votes in committee, which is a different matter. I do not believe that we spoke of this aspect in the Conference of Presidents.

 Madam President, I am glad we are having this debate at the same time as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose conclusions we all look forward to, is being held in Paris. In this regard, Madam President, may I suggest that we invite Dr Pachauri, chairman of the panel, which comprises the world’s most eminent scientists dealing with this issue, to attend a public hearing in this Chamber. I met him briefly yesterday in Paris and I believe that his explanations and recommendations would be very useful in the battle ahead of us if we intend to help overcome this challenge to civilisation. What is the current state of play? I would personally say that we must send out a message to our citizens that is both lucid and stimulating, one that consists of one piece of bad news and two pieces of good news. The bad news is the current state of affairs. Around the world, the situation has become even worse over the past six years, and in the EU we have got off to a bad start in honouring our Kyoto commitments, which were woefully inadequate to start with. If we were to continue at this rate, we would do the planet intolerable damage not only for future generations but for our children’s generation, too. So much for the bad news, which certainly is bad. I now turn to the first piece of good news: it is possible to reverse the trend. (Addressing Members who are talking and not listening to him)
 Ladies and gentlemen, if the issue of climate change only interests you in front of the media, then I feel sorry for you … (Applause)
 … because just before, when the Council and the Commission were talking about it, I counted you, and there were no more than 50 Members in the Chamber. Please do not come just to vote without knowing the background. Come and take part in the debate, or at least show some respect for those who are speaking. (Applause)
 Having mentioned the bad news, here is the first piece of good news that we can announce to the citizens. It is possible to reverse the trend, but this would admittedly require something akin to a revolution. The objectives of reducing emissions are well known – a reduction of 50% around the world, and thus 75% in our countries, by 2050. To achieve this will entail not only substantial increases in clean energy sources but also a new relationship as regards energy efficiency, involving a massive upsurge in the development of railways and motorways of the sea, the implementation, as mentioned by other speakers, of ambitious anti-pollution standards on car manufacturers, in spite of the pressure from Mrs Merkel, the massive construction of energy-saving houses, training in the use of more fuel-efficient technologies, international trade based much more on cooperation than competition, massive long-term investment and the adoption of the notion of the common good, in other words a number of major setbacks for liberal globalisation. I now turn to the second piece of good news, namely the sharp increase in public awareness of these issues, including in the United States and emerging countries. This historic gamble has no chance of paying off unless that fundamental element is in place. One word of warning, however: I doubt whether the citizens would accept a Malthusian response to the problems we face. Leaving behind the preoccupation with economic productivity does not mean hampering social development. The fight against climate change will not be a smooth process. (Applause from the left and the centre)

Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, I should like to thank you, Mrs Merkel, for your fine speech, your remarks about freedom and tolerance and your quotation of the great Voltaire. Of the heavy responsibilities incumbent on your Presidency, certain issues will unfortunately be more mundane, not least that of the launch of the process that is due to lead to the adoption, in two years’ time, of a new European treaty. It is on this one point that I should like to make some brief comments. My colleague, Mrs Zimmer, will expand on my speech in a few moments’ time. My first remark concerns the joint declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which, in this context, will constitute an important message to our fellow citizens. Allow me to make a suggestion: beware of too much backslapping, of overly polished assessments, of commitments that are abstract and wordy on the major principles but evasive on the issues that cause anger! That kind of approach will in no way lessen the crisis of confidence that we are experiencing, but will be liable, instead, to increase the scepticism that is growing a little bit everywhere. My second warning concerns the initiative – which is certainly not incumbent upon you personally – to gather together at the end of January representatives solely from the countries that ratified the draft Constitutional Treaty. I regard this manner of pointing the finger at the so-called bad pupils of the European class as unfortunate and counterproductive. What we need to do, instead, is to hold an open, frank and respectful dialogue with all of the nations of the Union, and not avoid contradictions, because, if we do avoid them, we will just be keeping ourselves happy and we will not make any progress. I firmly believe – and this is the final point that I wish to highlight – that the unrest being caused by the Union’s current approach is not just French and Dutch. It is European. And, as Mr Schulz said, it is primarily social in origin. This is where we need to change the substance. In the German Presidency’s programme, you propose what Mr Schulz has just requested of you, which is that – and I quote – in future, European projects should be examined in the light of their social repercussions, too. Marvellous! Let us start straightaway, then! Let us start with the third rail package on the liberalisation of rail, for example, or by extending this approach to directives that already exist, such as the Services Directive or the Working Time Directive, or to forthcoming decisions such as the one on the modernisation of labour law. As your fellow countrymen, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, used to say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The proof of social Europe is in its being used in practice. Thus, to quote your Presidency's logo, together, we will make Europe succeed. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole of my group, including those colleagues of mine who are unavoidably prevented from being in the House today, has come out in favour of my candidacy. Why? We have always considered the election of the President of the European Parliament to be a political act of some significance and, as such, an opportunity not to blur the political differences between us but, on the contrary, to affirm them loud and clear, at least in the first round if there are also to be others. That seems to us to be all the more true this time round, when the second half of the parliamentary term will be marked by the debate on the future of Europe. In this connection, Mr Poettering consistently and unambiguously champions a certain vision of Europe with which most conservative and liberal MEPs and members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group can readily identify. It should be acknowledged that I, for my part, advocate in this House, just as consistently and unambiguously as Mr Poettering, another vision of Europe that might be referred to as an alternative to what we call liberal Europe. If I had to define it in broad terms, I would refer to five areas. First of all, there is the social dimension. We must stop setting one social model up against another – models that systematically chip away at the social achievements of several generations. Then there is the ecological dimension. We must resist the ever stronger temptation to lower our sights in the name of competitiveness in an open economic set-up. There is also the dimension of mutual support. We must banish all forms of exclusion, mobilise every instrument at our disposal in combating inequalities in development and turn our back on Fortress Europe. Above all, there is the democratic dimension. We must encourage the critical spirit, dare to let the people speak and agree to question what needs to be questioned. Finally, there is the global dimension. We need to use what clout we have to transform international relations. We must join forces in order to oppose the war in Iraq and fight for a just peace in Palestine and for a genuine partnership with Africa. In our relations with the United States, the principle whereby we are allied, rather than aligned, nations needs to prevail. My candidacy is aimed at simply offering fellow Members who identify with this desire for change and with this demand for critical reflection on the current social model the opportunity of expressing their opinions. Democracy is about accepting the majority decision, and there is no doubt at all that Mr Poettering will be the next President of the European Parliament and one who represents all of us. Democracy is also about respect for individuals. I wish to say again in this House that I have nothing but praise for the loyalty and cooperation demonstrated by Mr Poettering in the Conference of Presidents, where we have sat together for seven and a half years. Democracy is primarily, however, a debate about ideas, and, in a few moments, this will be demonstrated in the shape of a clear and unequivocal vote reflecting our convictions. We all share political responsibility. That is why I, for my part, did not feel the need to conduct any kind of election campaign. It is for each of us to accept our responsibilities with our eyes wide open.

 Mr President, I offer you my sincere congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the European Parliament. Quite apart from the agreements concluded between the groups and taking account of the power struggles at present going on in this House, your election is not only fully legitimate but also perfectly logical. You are now the President of us all. As for myself, I have no doubts at all about either your determination or your aptitude for performing this role without, of course, giving up either your ideas or the nature of your commitment. You have strong convictions that often form the basis of our disagreements. However, you also have an ethical code that earns you genuine respect and you display a commitment to pluralism that makes constructive cooperation possible. We therefore have confidence in you. I hope, Mr President, that you succeed fully on the challenging but pleasurable path ahead of you. (Applause)

 Mr President, at the start of this parliamentary term, I gave the following response to your first speech, in which you set out the broad outlines of your Presidency: ‘Your words’, I said, ‘reinforce our view that we can develop very constructive and cooperative relations with you.’ That is exactly how it has proved to be, and I thank you for a number of reasons. I should first like to commend you for being a genuine progressive. In spite of the constraints of your office and the particular conditions under which you exercised your mandate, you have succeeded in remaining true to our shared ideals. Just a few days ago, in your speech to Humboldt University, you fiercely criticised the trend, and I quote, 'of letting social and fiscal competition develop between our countries, which leads to Europe coming across not as a constructive response to globalisation, but rather as a Trojan horse that undermines social connections.' I share that view. This type of convergence could, on its own, justify the view that we enjoy an excellent relationship. There is another quality, however, that you have shown and that I should like to highlight. Although they are close in certain areas, your political views do not coincide a great deal with those promoted by my group, and on some issues they are far apart, a case in point being the draft Constitutional Treaty. Yet what we appreciate in you is your ability to listen to different points of view, even on a matter as tricky as this one. It is not that you listen politely against a background of indifference; rather, you listen attentively against a background of respect for the speaker and, by extension, a desire to understand the speaker’s motivations. I am grateful to you for understanding the idea that one can be in favour of the European project whilst being staunchly opposed to a headlong commercial and financial rush forwards, and to the widespread competition that goes with it, which we call liberal Europe. I repeat this today, the day on which we welcome our fellow Members from Romania and Bulgaria: if we want to haul ourselves out of the crisis of confidence – the crisis of common sense, even – afflicting Europe, we need to view the current model with a critical eye. If we call for far-reaching changes, we do so in order that the citizens of our 27 countries might recognise that the Union is theirs. Our criticism is therefore constructive, and I am grateful to you for understanding this. When we take stock of a term of office of a President of Parliament, there is almost always a defining event or act that stands out, a landmark moment of some kind. If I had to pinpoint that key point in your term of office I would say it was last summer as war was being waged against Palestine and Lebanon. As all politicians should do in such a case, you clearly asked yourself: in my position, what can I do, however modestly, to oppose such an injustice? Your response was to call all the group chairmen back from holiday to do something on Parliament’s behalf that the EU-25, at their level, had proved incapable of doing, namely to call for, at the very least, an immediate cease-fire and a return to the rule of international law; you also called for talks to begin aimed at exchanging prisoners and for international negotiations to be held at the earliest opportunity on the basis of all the relevant UN resolutions on the Middle East. Admittedly, we did not change the face of the world with our unanimous resolution, but we at least, thanks to you, saved Europe's honour. For these reasons, Mr President, I thank you. I hope that your future duties will enable us to pursue our excellent, fruitful cooperation. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I would like, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, to welcome our two new Commissioners, Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban. My group will approve these two nominations. I myself would have preferred it if the President of the Commission had made the most of the conclusion of this stage of enlargement to engage in a fundamental debate on an interim assessment of his Commission, to reshuffle the cards within the enlarged Commission, if appropriate, and, finally, to submit the whole of his team to Parliament's vote. At a time when so many questions are being asked about the operation, the direction and the future of the EU, this would have done the Commission's authority and parliamentary democracy no harm at all. As we can see, this was not what was decided. Even so, all the best to Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban. (Applause)

 Mr President, I will not go into the details of the analysis of the REACH compromise that will be put before us. My colleague Mr Holm will do that in a few moments. For my part, I would like to dwell on just one idea: REACH is both a fine illustration of what Europe could be and a sad confirmation of its contradictions today. Only a few weeks ago, REACH promised to be the sign of a real ambition for Europe. The European Union was going to adopt legislation that at last put public health and the environment above short-term economic calculation; it was at last requiring undertakings to take account of the social cost of their headlong pursuit of competitiveness; it was at last learning the lessons of the asbestos scandal and, given that the new legislation would also cover products imported in considerable quantities, Europe was forcing world industry to adapt to its new standards. Europe therefore had a great opportunity, in an area that very much strikes a chord among our citizens, to forge itself an identity of progress by changing conditions here and in the world. With this in view, many non-governmental organisations, trade unions and elected representatives have worked actively to make this fine project a success. Many of them are now very disillusioned at the excessive concessions made to the big European groups. Admittedly, and this is an important point to make, the reversal of the burden of proof remains. It is no longer up to the authorities to prove that the chemicals used are toxic, but for industry to show that they are safe. That being the case, what justification can there be for allowing undertakings to continue, even if under supervision, to use substances that are acknowledged to be very dangerous even though less harmful alternatives are available on the market? After the terrible precedent of asbestos, this is ethically unacceptable, as is the right given to company managements to keep secret the information they hold on the possible toxicity of chemical substances less than 10 tonnes of which are produced in a year, as is the case of the great majority of them. Please stop using the financial weakness of small and medium-sized enterprises as a pretext! My group tabled an amendment requiring large companies to provide SMEs with the information they possess on the substances in question in order to save them pointless expenditure. That amendment was rejected by the authors of the majority compromise. One last comment worth thinking about. This second-rate compromise is not the result of economic weakness in the face of an unequal balance of power; the bad example comes from the top. The REACH legislation is too ambitious. It is not the kind of project that the Commission will be presenting in future, Mr Verheugen, the Commission Vice-President responsible for industry, said back in mid-September. The most worrying thing is that he made that announcement during a speech on the ‘Better Regulation’ initiative, which says a lot about the strategic direction that pernicious slogan indicates. We have seen its effects in the social field, with the ‘Services’ Directive and the Green Paper on labour law, for example. Now it is the turn of public health and the environment to be affected. The debate on what has got to change in European integration is decidedly more topical than ever.

Mr President, to begin with, I should like to take this opportunity to greet a sizeable delegation in the visitors' gallery of workers from Volkswagen's Forest plant, officials from all the trade unions in the plant and representatives of subcontracting companies. (Applause)
 A large contingent from my group visited the occupied plant yesterday and engaged in lengthy talks with the workforce and union representatives. What emerged from these talks? The first and foremost requirement, Commissioner, is to save the jobs at that location. The European Union is in a quandary for want of an industrial policy. As Mr Jonckheer has reminded us, the crisis in the European car industry is nothing new. Vilvorde happened ten years ago, and since then other plants have been closed or threatened with closure. What has been done in the fields of research and investment policy and in the pursuit of balanced regional development? What efforts have been made to ensure that workers are trained and jobs safeguarded, to develop the clean, reliable and affordable cars that are in demand today and to diversify the economic fabric and increase the number of secure, skilled and properly paid jobs? The large manufacturing groups have been given their head in the name of sacrosanct free-market economics and unbridled competition. The immediate duty of everyone, including the European Union, is therefore to act to save these jobs at the Forest plant, not only for the workforce of the Volkswagen group but also for the 8 000 employees of subcontracting businesses. Mr Henin will pick up that point in a moment. Secondly, if this mass mobilisation should fail, raising the issue of compensation, the Volkswagen group must be formally bound to meet its responsibilities to the full. The trade-union leaders reminded us in detail of the long list of public aid in the form of diverse exemptions that have been granted in respect of this plant to a group which, incidentally, has seen its profits rise sharply over the past two years, at least sharply enough to enable it to announce yesterday that it planned to invest hundreds of millions in Asia. In addition, it goes without saying that the European Union should contribute to the compensation. At the heart of this affair, however, we see the need for structural changes in the economic strategy being pursued in the name of what the Commission calls a competitive Europe in a globalised economy, which, in plain words, means cutting wage costs, introducing flexible working conditions, creating 'shareholder value', in other words windfalls for shareholders, pitting workers against each other and using the threat of relocation to blackmail public authorities. This takes us to the very core of the celebrated liberal Europe, from which more and more Europeans feel totally alienated, and with good reason. Only a break with this line of approach can open the door to a socially responsible Europe and enable us to win back the trust of our fellow citizens. Mr Barroso often makes the case for a Europe that gets results. Europe in its present state delivers results such as this one at Volkswagen Forest. We could do with more Europe, a trade unionist told us, but it is a different Europe that we need. This demand will surely be expressed forcefully in the streets of Brussels on Saturday. (Applause)

 Mr President, in Parliament's relations with the Council, we are familiar with codecision and conciliation. Today, with the Services Directive, we can add capitulation to that. What other word is there for the incredible decision taken by the majority groups to yield to the Council's urgings by agreeing to withdraw all the amendments examined in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and to adopt the Council's common position without opposition, even though it is indubitably a backward step from their own compromise of 16 February this year? I would remind you that the European Trade Union Confederation felt it necessary to amend this text on certain points that it regarded as being 'of major importance', notably with regard to the 'clearer exclusion of labour law and social services, and clearer respect for fundamental rights'. In fact, the Council's text makes the preservation of labour law in the Member States subordinate to compliance with Community law – a vague wording that refers to the rules on competition. Some of you are consoling yourselves with Commissioner McCreevy's reassuring statement. This really is very odd reasoning. Dare I remind you that it was in fact Mr McCreevy who, just a year ago, used Community law to justify preventing a Latvian business from recognising collective agreements in Sweden, in the Waxholm affair that caused such a stir? On the other hand, the Council has restored to the Commission an incredible level of power to monitor – both before and after the fact – the legislation of the Member States; it was precisely this power that Parliament wanted to restrict. Mr McCreevy sees this change as a crucial improvement, and that is perfectly understandable, but what does Parliament see in it? Nobody is saying anything. Finally, the ambiguities and grey areas in the text of the directive – which I criticised at first reading on behalf of my group because, as I said at the time, they leave the door open for uncontrollable interpretation from the Commission and the Court – have already started to be exploited as we feared they would be. For example, the Commission's communication on social services sets out an extremely simplistic vision of these services, which, by the way, Commissioner Špidla was keen to stress would increasingly fall within the scope of Community law on the internal market and competition. Another Commission communication, dealing with the posting of workers, attacks regulations in certain Member States with respect to service providers from other EU countries that it regards as disproportionate. Here, too, the Commission is leaning on the inexhaustible case-law of the Court. Where, then, are the safeguards that the directive was supposed to provide against this slippery slope leading the whole of social life into anything-goes competition? In general, the President-in-Office put it very clearly: 'the Court's interpretation will be needed in many cases'. Well, my group will not support this massive deregulation exercise. Above and beyond the issue of services, there is, in my view, the issue of the concept of European integration. Do we want to use the law to harmonise protective rules and push them upwards, or are we going to accept the harmonisation through the market and competition of standards that will consequently inevitably be dragged downwards? Do we want to promote parliamentary and citizens' democracy, or are we going to allow ourselves to be governed by case-law and interpretative communications? A few weeks away from the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, these are perfectly legitimate questions, and I am willing to bet that many of our fellow citizens will soon be asking them quite forcefully. (Applause)

 Mr President, my group has always condemned terrorist acts, whoever the perpetrators and whatever the scale of the acts and the reasons given to justify them. We are in favour of political struggle, with the exclusion of all forms of violence. We see violence as reprehensible in all circumstances except where, as provided for by the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a population, in the absence of the rule of law is ‘compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression’. Even in this case, attacks on civilians are, in our opinion, to be prohibited. All the more reason for our having unreservedly and systematically condemned the attacks by ETA, which have killed hundreds of innocent people. We continue to remember these victims and express once again our solidarity with their loved ones. For a long time, we have been hoping that this chapter could be closed, once and for all. We were therefore extremely pleased to welcome the announcement of the permanent ceasefire by ETA. We therefore also greatly appreciate the open and responsible attitude with which the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Zapatero, has taken this opportunity to endeavour to achieve peace, in particular in his speech on 28 June 2005, by choosing the path of dialogue while taking care to respect the laws and legal procedures in force in his country. The European Parliament would be honoured to lend its support to this move. It is in this spirit that the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has united with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe through a joint resolution. I would add that we believe it would be a good thing for MEPs from other groups to also lend their support to a move that is nothing short of a reflection of the wishes of the majority of Spanish people, namely that a peace process be opened, based on legal grounds. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I express a point of view largely shared by my group when I say that I agree that the 1956 uprising in Hungary should be considered first and foremost as a popular uprising for freedom and independence. I also agree that the bloody repression of this uprising by the Soviet army should be unreservedly condemned. Finally, I agree that this Hungarian tragedy should be seen as an emblematic event, because it sheds light on the heart of the existential crisis of a model which would disappear thirty-three years later, as it was unable to reform itself profoundly. By contrast, we cannot accept a unilateral reading of contemporary history that demonises the communist idea. To stay with the case of Hungary, I would remind you that high-ranking communists played a major role in that country in the movement contesting the regime. We are all familiar with the part played by Nagy Imre, the reforming communist Prime Minister who paid with his life for his commitment to the side of the insurgents. It is less well known that the famous Petofi circle, whose activities are considered as one of the trigger factors of the movement, was formed on the initiative of young communists. I could go on to cite the name of the great communist philosopher György Lukács, who was also involved in this struggle for reform. In fact, over a whole period, we witnessed a rising tide of protests inspired by communists, whose criticisms were unfortunately stifled. History was not written in advance, it is no more so today. And so, let us condemn Stalinist crimes as much as necessary, but let us not rekindle the spirit of the cold war which was never productive for freedom and independence in any area. The reunified Europe has more to achieve by turning resolutely towards the future. (Applause from the left)

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the general interest, the public good, the common good, public services: these are all key reference points which, as the President of the Commission has said, are at the heart of the debate on the concept of the European social model. We are touching here upon people’s daily lives, on their perception of the future and on our conception of society. Fundamental values, such as equality, solidarity and democracy, are at stake. The issues are too important for us to deal with by means of fuzzy definitions or unsatisfactory compromises. My group wishes to emphasise three aspects that require clarification. The first is the relationship between public services and the rules governing the internal market, in other words the provisions on competition, public procurement and state aid, not to mention the powers of the Commission and the Court to monitor and sanction perceived abuses. In our view, we need a radically new legal basis that will allow public services to exist in Europe outside the logic of the market. It is true, as Mr Barroso and Mr Lipietz have reminded us, that the Treaty gives precedence to the provision of public services in cases where such provision conflicts with the rules of competition. It also recognises that national governments have the right to define general interest, but it is the Commission and, in the final analysis, the Court that determine the extent to which derogations may be made. Consequently, a country that is not considered to be anti-liberal, namely the Netherlands, has been brought to book for having committed, and I quote, ‘a manifest public-service error, because the subsidised social housing cooperatives counted among their tenants households that were not socially disadvantaged’. The truth is that this exemption regime is effectively tending to whittle away at public services. This brings me to the second point I wish to make, namely the extent of our ambitions in the realm of public services. In our view, these services should quite simply cover the fundamental rights that everyone has in equal measure in this twenty-first century, namely education, health care, housing and decent living conditions, child care, information, culture, transport, telecommunications, postal services, energy and water supply, sewage and waste disposal and other needs that have become compelling, such as access to credit. Services in these areas must therefore be governed by the imperative of socially effective delivery without being subjected to the pressure of competition. One third and final aspect needs to be highlighted, and that is the link between subsidiarity and the European integration project. As has been said, experiences of public-service management, of property structures and of funding methods vary from one country to another. It must be the sovereign right of each country to make these choices, with all their implications. So do we or do we not need a framework directive? The debate on this issue has begun in our group, and I, for my part, would say ‘Let’s go for it!’ Let the Commission prepare such an instrument on the basis of the principles I have just restated. Some might object that this approach is incompatible with the rules of the Treaty. That, in fact, is exactly why we want to change those rules. I propose, Madam President, that we put this question at the top of the agenda for the great debate that has been announced on the future of Europe, and we shall see what Europeans really think about this matter.
 Francis Wurtz,

Mr President, Mr Tuomioja, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, what we have experienced this summer ought to be totally and utterly inconceivable in our time. Let us recall, firstly, that a State, Israel, is shelling and starving the civilian population of Gaza, is kidnapping ministers and politicians, who are going to join the 8 000 Palestinian prisoners already in detention, and has killed more than 200 people in this small region, which has become, according to the expression used by Mr Jan Egeland, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, a ticking time-bomb. Then, the same army has been pounding Lebanon for a full 34 days, making no distinction, according to Human Rights Watch, between civilians and military targets, causing the deaths of 1 100 civilians, forcing a quarter of the population to move, imposing a total blockade of the country, deliberately targeting – as Mr Annan pointed out – and killing observers from the international peacekeeping force, destroying – according to the UNDP – 15 000 houses and 78 bridges, demolishing the country’s vital infrastructure, ports, airports and power stations, causing a huge oil slick, and using shells that can contain as many as 644 explosive devices, with 100 000 of these devices continuing to blindly kill men, women and children. Secondly, a superpower, the United States, is supporting its ally’s strategy, both in Palestine and Lebanon, in the name of the war against terrorism, which is already underway in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its Secretary of State compares the suffering of the people of Lebanon to the pain of giving birth to the new Middle East. In the midst of war, she is delivering increasingly sophisticated weapons to Israel and has been refusing, for more than a month of relentless fighting, to call for a ceasefire, something that the Lebanese Government and the United Nations Secretary-General have nonetheless been passionately calling for. My third and final point is that an institution that is particularly close to us, the Council, has long proved itself incapable of calling for a ceasefire despite the commendable attempt made by the Finnish Presidency and the unanimous appeal launched along these lines by Parliament’s Conference of Presidents. The Council is even finding excuses for the Israeli army’s behaviour by speaking of the right to self-defence. Just as it was legitimate to condemn the initial capture of the Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah, then above all the latter’s serious decision to respond to the bombing of Lebanese towns by launching missiles on Israeli towns, thus in turn committing crimes against the civilian population, the green light that has de facto
 been given to Israel for many days now to carry out and pursue this terrifying war is leaving people amazed and is fuelling revolt. We therefore cannot be content today and in the period to come with only talking about European contributions to UNIFIL and to the reconstruction process, as important as these two issues are. By adopting a clear-sighted approach and in a spirit of responsibility, we must learn lessons from this painful experience, beginning with the following: at the heart of all the upheavals in the Middle East, which are becoming more tragic for the populations and more dangerous for international security as each day passes, there is the occupation of the territories that were conquered in 1967 and Israel’s persistent refusal to see the relevant United Nations’ Security Council resolutions applied. The fact is that the European Union has taken the pressure off with regard to this crucial requirement for peace. What initiative has it taken to relaunch the Quartet’s road map? What did it do to promote the Arab League’s plan in 2002, which was proposing the normalisation of relations with Israel in exchange for recognition of the Palestinian State? What has it done to make the Israeli leaders face up to their historical responsibilities? Instead of doing anything in those areas, it has suspended aid to the Palestinian institutions, delegitimised a democratically-elected government and parliament, shunned the courageous efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to rebuild a national accord and accepted without any difficulty the closure of the only crossing points between Gaza and the outside, which it was officially controlling. I hope that the joint decisions taken over the last few days will signal a turnaround for Europe with regard to the entire Middle East. At present, Europe must make the long-term choice between President Bush’s notion of the war against terrorism and a return to the fundamentals of international law. I believe that a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East comes at that price, as does Europe’s credibility in the world.

Mr President, we are calling for the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit and we are calling for the release of 9 000 Palestinian prisoners – of whom 128 are women, 300 are adolescents and 900 are being detained without trial. The Israeli army’s offensive on Gaza and the unprecedented seizure of a third of the Palestinian Ministers, of the President of Parliament and of many Hamas Members of Parliament, have nothing really to do with the desire to free that soldier. These plans had been in place well before his capture. The Olmert Government took this opportunity to try to take a decisive step towards a well-established and now well-known strategy. Firstly, the idea is to depose the Palestinian Government, even if it means all that remains of the Palestinian Authority of President Abbas being destroyed in the process. Then, as always, they will say that there is no Palestinian interlocutor to negotiate with. The way will then be open for Israel to impose its borders unilaterally. The regrouping of the settlements into three great blocs, which are easier to defend, the dividing up of the Palestinian territories and the annexation of almost half of the West Bank, of the Jordan Valley and of East Jerusalem and the continued construction of the wall: in short, a fait accompli
 destroying any hope of a Palestinian State deserving of the term. Finally, the chaos thereby generated within Palestinian society will make it possible to justify continuing use of force, in the name of the essential need for security. This strategy is not just monstrous for the Palestinian people. It may well mean that the Israelis themselves have a nightmarish future in store. How can they expect docile Palestinian leaders and a consenting population to emerge, as if by a miracle, from such a collapse? He who sows despair, reaps violence. Palestinian society is in danger of concluding that playing the game of democracy has brought them nothing but more misfortune. Faced with such a challenge, is the European Union going to let the Palestinian institutions that it has spent 12 years helping to create be destroyed? Is it going to abandon the Palestinian President in the middle of this turmoil, when, together with the head of the government, he has just achieved something that nobody dared hope for, that is the conclusion of an agreement recognising Israel and opening up the way to a government of national unity? Or is it going to have the will and the courage, which I have not noticed on the part of the Council – something I regret – to make its mark by demanding the release of the Hamas leaders, by re-establishing appropriate aid and active cooperation with the Palestinian authority and government, and stating clearly the obligations of all States without exception according to international law and the Geneva Conventions. I believe that it is in this area, and from this moment on, that Europe is going to be staking much of the credibility of the Euro-Mediterranean project and its credibility as a global player in general.

 Mr President, Parliament is acting as it should by organising this political act to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of Franco’s unleashing of the Spanish Civil War. Indeed, the destruction of that young Republic is, in more than one respect, relevant to the whole of Europe. First of all, the forces of the 1936 Putsch only managed to overcome the Popular Front with the decisive assistance of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. It was, too, in Spain that the latter experimented with a view to its future blitzkrieg
 against France, and Guernica was the first example in world history of the massacre of a civilian population by massive aerial bombardments  which was to become a terrifying model for what took place throughout the Second World War. Those dark years, 1936 - 1939, demand the attention of Europe for yet another reason: the way in which the republicans were betrayed by neighbouring democracies. The non-intervention of 1936 paved the way for Munich in 1938, which led to continent-wide disaster from 1939. What, moreover, is to be said about the smug indifference of Western and European leaders in general to the Francoist regime after the war, as soon as its leader had joined the forces for good against the evil empire. In conclusion, there is one final reason why the Spanish tragedy has a European dimension: this is the unparalleled surge of international solidarity to which it gave rise among the workers and the common people, as well as among the most eminent European intellectuals; a solidarity strikingly illustrated by the International Brigades, composed of 40 000 volunteers from around fifty countries. Conversely, a number of Spanish republicans went on to be members of the French Resistance. Some of them would take part in the Paris insurrection of August 1944 under the leadership of my late lamented comrade Henri Rol-Tanguy. Others took part in the liberation of Strasbourg in November of the same year in the army of General Leclerc. Without doubt, the European consciousness would not be the same without the unspeakable suffering of the victims of Francoism, without the intrepid courage of those Spaniards who offered resistance and without the tide of solidarity on which the young Republic was borne. May today’s commemorative act on our part pay to all the women and men concerned the tribute that they deserve. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, each of the main agenda items for the forthcoming European Council in its own way raises the issue of the meaning of European integration. Such is the case with regard to the results of the famous period of reflection and to the common energy policy, and Europe’s action in the world does not escape attention either. I shall begin by mentioning the period of reflection and its extension. The first part of the Brussels Summit’s draft conclusion is dedicated to this and is charmingly entitled: ‘Europe listens’. That is all well and good, but what is it listening to? The document elaborates on the measures to combat illegal immigration, which, I might add, are most unfortunately juxtaposed in the same sentence with trafficking in human beings, terrorism and organised crime. It deals with the Union's intervention mechanisms in the event of a crisis. It stresses the need, in future, to take the European Union’s absorption capacity more rigorously into account before embarking on the road to any further enlargement, and so forth. These are so many issues that are, I agree, present in the debate with our fellow citizens. Strangely enough, however, the issue that is at the heart of the crisis of confidence plaguing the Union, that is to say the social issue, is, for its part, completely sidelined in the European Council’s draft conclusion, which, in the course of one sentence, merely calls on the Commission to draft a report on the situation by next spring. Saying that is not tantamount to sinking into crisisphilia, Mr Barroso. I would point out that the Austrian Presidency itself put its finger on this issue as far back as January. That is what we must discuss first in order to draw the necessary conclusions from it. The public’s trust is not given as a matter of course. It is won. Let us turn now to the European energy policy. Helping to address the 21st century energy challenge is, in fact, a European responsibility par excellence
. Unbridled competition and the race for profitability are, however, unacceptable in this context. Preparing for the post-oil period, making far greater progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, developing the research effort with a view to increasing energy efficiency and diversity, transforming the way in which transport is organised and affirming the right to energy for all are eminently political tasks that, if they are to succeed, cannot be restricted by the short-sighted calculations of the market. Finally, the same debate concerns Europe’s ambitions in terms of external policy. Who can oppose the desire to provide ourselves, as the Commission is proposing, with operational instruments and rules able to increase the consistency, effectiveness and visibility of our external action? It is my conviction, however, that the fundamental reason for the weakness of Europe’s action in the world is neither technical nor institutional. It is due to the tragic lack of political will and common vision at the European Council. How else can we interpret, at this very moment, the staggering inertia of the 25 faced with the Israeli Government's irresponsible torpedoing of the initiative of the Palestinian President, in flagrant and continual breach of both the UN resolutions and the Quartet’s road map? All of that reinforces our idea that the famous period of reflection and Plan D will only be useful if they represent an opportunity to hold a trouble-free debate in the open on the structural changes to be promoted so that Europeans might once again see a reason to be positive about Europe in the world today.

Mr President, I should like, if I may, to make a preliminary remark, since we are inaugurating a series of new-style debates today. I believe that it is impossible to respond seriously, in three or four minutes, to an ex cathedra 
speech that lasts three quarters of an hour and that is also in-depth. In my opinion, the procedure needs to be revised. I have a great deal to say about some of the ideas put forward by Mr Verhofstadt. For example, about the idea of putting the Union’s crisis down mainly to a question of method, which is not federal enough in his opinion, by choosing to overlook the content of the economic and social decisions taken. That is an analysis that I regard as inadequate and that my group does not support. Or, indeed, about the idea of introducing, in the name of a form of social and economic governance, maximum social levels alongside the minimum levels that already exist. I do not really understand his reasoning, which seems to me, in any case, to be heading in the wrong direction. I have a great deal to say, too, about Mr Verhofstadt’s appeal for a military Europe and for that military Europe to be thoroughly integrated into NATO, an appeal with which we do not associate ourselves. I will not be able to expand on these various points now, because I would like to address another point that I feel Mr Verhofstadt glossed over. It concerns what is, in my opinion, our main problem today: I am referring to the reasons for the widening gap between Europeans and the Union. The results of the Commission’s consultation do reveal to us, however, some precious information about the cause of this disaffection, and I should like to mention three examples. Firstly, 47% of the people polled as part of this consultation see globalisation as a threat to jobs. In October 2003, 56% regarded globalisation as a good opportunity; 20% fewer of them think the same today. Yet, in October 2003, Europe was no more federal than it is today. Here is another result: what do the people polled think about the role played by the European Union in fifteen or so areas ranging from environmental protection to the fight against terrorism, via social policy, with the protection of social rights only appearing at the end of the list? They gave these areas a satisfaction rating of 4.7 out of 10. That has nothing to do with the Union’s being more or less federal. As regards Europe's ability to combat unemployment, which was consigned to the bottom of the list, the satisfaction rating is 3.8 out of 10. This figure, I would point out, is the average across the 25 Member States. How would you rate the educational performance of a pupil scoring 3.8 out of 10 in a core subject? That is how people perceive Europe's current ability to deal with the problems linked to globalisation. I believe that that is the main problem. We cannot cleverly sidestep it. Finally, what, in the eyes of most of the Europeans polled, is – and I quote – ‘the key element for the future of Europe’? The most popular answer: to achieve comparable living standards throughout the Union. That is the opinion of 51% of those polled in the 25 countries and of as many as 74% in the new Member States. Our new fellow citizens obviously have no desire for their countries to form a kind of low-cost or cut-price Europe, which business communities long for. To summarise, globalisation is perceived as a threat to the social model, and the single market is not seen as an answer to this fundamental problem. These concerns will not be alleviated by the project of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which is on the agenda of the next European Union-United States summit. Sidelining this section of the debate once again will not help us, in my opinion, to break the deadlock. It is only by accepting real changes, not only institutional ones, but also ones related to economic, social and political lines of action, that we will have the opportunity to breathe life back into the European dream.

Mr President, my fellow Member, Mr Watson, is a very intelligent and very astute person. I do not believe that he can look us in the eye and seriously say to us that we are talking about a human rights issue here. We are talking about something altogether different, as everyone knows; we are also talking about something that runs counter to the position held by the international community. I therefore believe that we should not support this proposal.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Poettering and Mr Swoboda said, our vote, which is along the same lines, obviously does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation that is going to be conducted. It is just that, with the accusations being very serious, we must ensure that there is complete transparency so that we can then judge and assess matters with full knowledge of the facts.

Mr President, I understand Mr Cohn-Bendit’s spontaneous reaction, and I should therefore like to try to provide him with an explanation. It was my group that asked for an item concerning the suspension of European Union aid to Palestine to be included on the agenda. We submitted this proposal a long time after the last Conference of Presidents and, as a result, it was technically impossible for the Conference of Presidents to debate it. That is why the secretaries-general consulted each other, as is customary. I therefore understood our President’s proposal in the following terms: it is now a matter of submitting to plenary the conclusions reached by the secretaries-general of the groups on the basis of our proposal and, if there is any opposition, we shall have to vote. That being said, I thought that there was practically a consensus on supporting our proposal, the only difference being that we, for our part, were also in favour of submitting a resolution. We shall not make a casus belli 
out of this matter, though.

Mr President, Mr Schüssel, Mr Barroso, my group has never advocated a thoughtless increase of the budget. What is more, we do not believe that the budget is the only instrument available to the Union when it comes to facilitating healthy growth and balanced development. Thus, it would undoubtedly be very helpful if the European Central Bank were to play a different role in this regard. Nevertheless, the budget is always the expression of a political desire. There is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfil them. That is particularly true in the case of enlargement, which everyone knew, even before the start of the process, would entail legitimate costs, particularly in the context of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. That is why even Parliament’s original demands and the Böge report seemed to us to fall a long way short of the financial needs corresponding to the commitments made. We therefore agreed with Parliament’s decision to reject the European Council’s cut-price compromise of last December. You were right, Mr Barroso, to point out at the time the drastic cuts that a financial perspective such as this would entail and to call for resources for education, research, the trans-European networks, cooperation and so on. From the point of view of these objectives, the 1.5% increase demanded by our negotiators was in itself extremely modest: 1.5% of 1.04% of the Union’s gross national income. As far as the Council was concerned, however, that was still three times too much. Under these circumstances, my group takes the view that our credibility depends on our rejecting this farce and that, consequently, we must shoulder our responsibilities.

Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, those with a sound knowledge of Israeli society assure us, in the wake of the elections, that the majority of the country’s population are now resolved to accept, willingly or not, the idea that the occupation of the Palestinian territories is, in every respect, a deadlock that needs to be broken. Unfortunately, the new Prime Minister is pursuing his predecessor’s strategy, namely unilateral separation on the basis of faits accomplis 
precluding the construction of a viable Palestinian State, on the one hand, and, for the time being, the oppression of the Palestinian people in an attempt to make them capitulate, on the other. This policy is irresponsible. Yesterday, the major Israeli daily, Haaretz
, quoted the United Nations in its headline ‘Gaza is on the brink of disaster’. In Nablus, in the West Bank, young people under the age of 30 are no longer allowed to leave their town! Kalandia, in the heart of the Palestinian Territory, has just been turned into a border terminal! East Jerusalem is surrounded! What is the meaning, then, of the proposal to negotiate with the Head of the Palestinian Authority whom, I might add, people are making every effort to discredit, as was the case during the recent coup de force
 in Jericho? In this context, it is almost moving to see new peace initiatives emerge from Palestinian and Israeli society, such as that of the combatants for peace, which is due to be officially launched on Monday. This initiative involves former officers of the Israeli army, who have joined forces with former combatants from Palestine and drawn from their respective experiences the common belief that the solution to the region’s problems can only be political and based on the relevant United Nations resolutions from 1967 onwards. We all pay tribute to the clear-sightedness and the courage of these women and men. What do they expect of the European Union, though? Aid alone is not enough: every nation needs freedom just as much as it needs bread. The fact remains that, by causing the collapse of the last remnants of Palestine’s social, administrative and security structures, the withdrawal of aid, even on a partial and temporary basis, would rule out any hope of just peace for a long time yet. More generally, what political role should Europe now play? Mr Solana just mentioned the Venice European Council in 1980, which is a good point of reference. A quarter of a century has, in fact, gone by since another key moment in the history of the Middle East, when we were able to assume our responsibilities. We had, at that time, officially recognised the PLO and adopted the ‘two peoples, two states’ principle. In my view, the current situation calls for a further strong act on the part of Europe. That act must be aimed at providing new and clear reference points leading to an outlook based on law and at restoring hope among the peace-keeping forces throughout the region. It was in this spirit that I proposed the idea of making our own institution act as a catalyst: it could decide to hold its Conference of Presidents in East Jerusalem with the aim of sending a real message of peace to all of the key figures there.

Mr President, Commissioners, in any battle, it is advisable to assess each stage correctly. One must neither underestimate the points scored, otherwise one encourages defeatism, nor overestimate what seems to have been won, for fear of setting oneself up for disillusionment. In the case of the so-called ‘Bolkestein’ draft directive, where are we in this respect? The points scored at first reading in Parliament by the opponents of the original text are undeniable. The removal of the reference to the country of origin principle and the adjustment to the actual application of the Directive are the most symbolic setbacks imposed on the hard-liners of liberal Europe. The exclusion of a number of sectors from the scope of the Directive and the granting to the host country of supervisory powers, which are, nonetheless, limited, conditional and difficult to implement, are also significant factors. Finally, the exclusion of labour law takes us back to the law currently in force. We shall examine the Commission’s new text under a microscope. If it appeared that the Commission was trying to reclaim part of the ground that it had had to concede, particularly by granting itself any automatic right of supervision, that would, in our opinion, constitute an unacceptable claim. If, on the other hand, it turned out that the Commission has included Parliament’s demands in its new revised draft directive, that would be both a fresh sign of the growing importance of our Assembly within the European institutional triangle and also, and perhaps most importantly, this would be the confirmation of the formative influence of the citizens’ sudden emergence in the European debate, especially since a certain 29 May 2005. That just shows you that our group has no intention of denying these developments. Having said that, however, does the result achieved to date manage to curb this craze for competition between workers, against which our fellow citizens are rising in ever-greater numbers? That is the real question, and our answer is ‘no’. Apart from the exceptions stated, the Directive in its amended form in fact reinforces rules establishing a form of integration that is no longer based on harmonisation of legislation, but on freedom of the market. The present circumstances and the weight of the acquis communautaire
 in this respect merit our renewed attention, especially at a time of the enlargement of the European Union to include countries whose social standards are attractive to economic and political leaders obsessed with lowering costs and lifting ‘barriers to competition’ in the notorious free market economy in which competition is open and undistorted. How are we prepared to depart from this repressive logic? When the time comes for the great open debate on the future of the European Union, that is the central issue on which I propose opening up the discussion, particularly on the left.

Mr President, my group has called for a statement from the Commission followed by a debate. We were, I might add, also in favour of submitting a resolution, but I believe that several groups do not want one. Why are we insisting, however, that there be at the very least a statement from the Commission followed by a debate? We are insisting because, for some days now, tanks have been sent to this region, Turkish Kurdistan. There are a great many victims, including children. The repression is extremely violent. This is a country that is in the process of negotiating its accession to the European Union. I therefore believe that this extremely serious breach of commitments made by the country in question is of direct concern to the Commission. That is why we want a statement and a debate to be included on Thursday’s agenda, and, if possible, as the first agenda item in the morning.

 Mr President, the speed with which President Mahmoud Abbas accepted your invitation showed the importance he attached to visiting the European Parliament, a fact that highlights the seriousness of the decision he had to take to return home suddenly. Indeed, he considered that his country could be placed in an extremely serious situation by this new and, as you rightly pointed out, deliberately humiliating escalation in Israeli violence and its inevitable consequences, all of which, like the kidnappings, were totally unacceptable, as well as being, however, unavoidable and foreseeable. I think that this matter is of concern to the European Union on several counts, firstly because a Member State, namely the United Kingdom, had concluded an agreement with the United States and the Palestinian Authority under which it would be these two Western countries that oversaw the prison concerned. It is that agreement that Israel has flagrantly violated, despite there not having been any problems at all in the prison for four years. No prisoner has escaped or tried to do so. If, moreover – and I would address Mr Cohn-Bendit now - Israel had thought that there was a problem, President Abbas had proposed to the Israeli Government that the prisoners be transferred to Moukata under proper, indeed international, surveillance. There was therefore no excuse or basis at all for Israel’s decision. Can we accept that? The second reason why I think this matter is of concern to the European Union is – if I may speak frankly – the EU’s systematically indulgent attitude towards, formerly, Ariel Sharon’s government and, now, that of his successor. How otherwise is it to be understood why an aspiring prime minister should dare be so reckless as to risk inflaming the already explosive situation in Palestine and in the region solely in order – and here I agree with my fellow MEPs – to appease the most extreme fringe of his electorate. It really is hard to credit. If he can allow himself to do this, it is because he knows that, on the one hand, American leaders give Israel carte blanche to do whatever it likes and that, on the other hand, Israel has got used to enjoying de facto impunity, courtesy of European leaders. We now have to ask ourselves the following question: given the results of this policy, are we going to continue blithely to look on while this new blow to peace progressively weakens the position of those Palestinians most committed to peaceful solutions including, in the first place, President Mahmoud Abbas? These are the questions that, I believe, we have to ask ourselves. For my part, I shall submit three precise proposals tomorrow morning to the Conference of Presidents, all calling for an immediate reaction by our Parliament, the idea being formally to demonstrate our commitment to the rule of law and to a just peace in the Middle East.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, the Commission generally has the knack of finding evocative patronymics for its programmes: Erasmus, Socrates and so on. Well, it could have called its Lisbon Strategy ‘Janus’ after the famous Roman deity, traditionally represented as having two faces: one looking to the future and the other to the past, exactly like the Lisbon agenda. One of these faces of the Lisbon Strategy for the ten-year period 2000–2010 is pleasing and calls to mind the conclusions of the 2005 spring European Council with their talk of the need for, and I quote, ‘investing in human capital [which is] Europe’s most important asset’. It heralds more jobs – even full employment – as well as better quality jobs. It emphasises the importance of research, education and innovation, as well as of having a solid industrial fabric throughout the territory of the EU. It even puts forward the objective, and I quote, of ‘halting the loss of biological diversity between now and 2010’. That particular face of the European Janus looks towards the future. It seems to herald such an era of social, economic and ecological progress that, at first sight, it is difficult to understand why the Commission considers, and I quote, that ‘[a] lot remains to be done to convince people that reforms will contribute to greater, shared prosperity and to involve them in the process’. Why, for heaven’s sake? It is because there is the other face of the Lisbon Strategy, this one directed towards the EU leaders’ unrelenting liberal obsessions. I would refer to the latest Commission communication with its references to, for example, the need to make Europe more attractive to business, to reforming pensions, the health sector and the labour market and to stabilising the budget, raising the retirement age, increasing productivity at work, ensuring genuine competition in the services sector and promoting increased competition in the electricity and gas markets. The Commission even expects the unions to play a role in the proliferation of this liberal strategy and expects Parliament also to convey its virtues. We are seeing German civil servants joining forces to protest against longer working hours and lower salaries and Italian employees demanding a thorough review of law 30 and the way in which it blithely generates job insecurity. We are seeing young French people rebelling against plans for two-year contracts of employment enabling bosses to dismiss them at will, female salaried staff in Britain challenging plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years and employees in the new Member States of Central Europe opposed to their countries being considered part of a low cost zone and demanding their rights to social progress. Faced with these people and, indeed, all those opposed to the strategy of squeezing public and social expenditure that is being conducted under the aegis of the Stability Pact, do not, I beseech you, rely on us to explain to them that they are mistaken because, contrary to appearances, the Lisbon Strategy has their well-being at heart. The truth of the matter is that the two aspects of the Lisbon Strategy are incompatible. The second needs to be thwarted so that the first might thrive. That is the choice facing us.

Mr President, my group is obviously in favour of any measure allowing Members to give an informed opinion. This is a question of transparency and responsibility, even though, as myself and my group believe, the outcome of the final vote is clearly dependent on the direction in which the debates have gone. I believe that it is only right that the other Members who remain hesitant should be able to consult each other so as to give an informed opinion. I am therefore in favour of the suspension before the final vote.

Mr President, of all the peremptory judgments expressed so far with regard to the cartoons of Mohammed, there are few I find very convincing. This issue lends itself to all kinds of oversimplification and I believe that this is a trap that we must avoid at all costs. It is urgent that we reflect on the various facets of the problems we are facing calmly and in depth. First of all, there is the issue of freedom of expression, clearly the touchstone of democracy and also the touchstone of the existence of a secular public space to which we quite rightly attach great importance. In this space, a critical spirit, a personal relationship to one’s faith and tolerance are supposed to prevail. These principles must not be compromised, but at the same time let us agree that the defence of these principles must not allow for insults, generalisations or stigmatisation, let alone justify them. We are constantly saying that we all live in the same world, a world that is getting smaller, in which everything is interdependent and of which neither Europe, the West in general, or any other region, is the centre. We must draw every possible conclusion from this. We are constantly being watched by the whole of humanity. We must therefore strive to create a kind of global public spirit. Everybody must exercise their freedom while respecting everybody else. On the other hand, what should we make of the entirely disproportionate reactions of certain Arab States to these incidents, which are surely intended above all to restore the rather tarnished reputation of their leaders amongst their populations, resulting from their submission to a great power that is far more blameworthy than peaceful Denmark? Elsewhere, the Islamic radicals compete with the European far right to exploit this kind of issue to galvanise their respective troops and to silence the reasonable, courageous and progressive voices with whom they are battling. The worst thing would therefore be inadvertently to fuel their cause, rather than doing everything possible to break this vicious circle. We must look beyond this current unrest and the entirely unacceptable excesses that it has generated, and consider the absolutely essential issue that lies behind it, that is to say the heightened expressions of identities wounded by a profound sense of injustice, domination and humiliation, for which the West, from Palestine to Iraq in particular, is responsible. As the great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, stresses in a more general sense: 'Arabs and Muslims have the impression of being pushed outside of history'. It is here that I believe Europe could play an essential role: building bridges between civilisations. But in order for that ambition to be credible, it means being fully liberated from those who, while behaving like the masters of the world, are in reality leading it – we see this a little more every day – to the brink of a clash. That also means applying the same international law to all States without exception, in order in particular to put an end to the open wound in the Middle East, which is an endless source of the poison of despair. The unfortunate cartoons affair should serve to illustrate the strategic options that we are facing! (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Bartenstein, we could have marked St Valentine's Day by debating a more romantic subject than the Bolkestein directive. Things being what they are, though, what comments can the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left make on the latest rehash of such an emblematic draft directive? First of all, we cannot help but notice with pleasure that the exceptional social and political movements against this directive, which have been growing for more than a year, have achieved their first result: we have managed to put the supporters of the directive on the defensive. After all, as Mr McCreevy, the Commission's spokesman and Mr Bolkestein's successor, has just emphasised, we have to be realistic – there have been referendums in France and in the Netherlands. Or, as John Monks, Secretary-General of the European Trade Union Confederation, said, the success of the 'no' vote 'changed the European landscape [because] everyone subsequently understood that social matters must be at the heart of European policies'. That is why we are not turning our noses up at the changes made during the various negotiations on the directive in the Commission. However, the question that arises is whether the directive, in its amended form, has become a good directive – whether its essential substance has changed. In short, can workers now, as some claim, be reassured as to the future of their social rights? Unfortunately, our answer to that is 'no', and I think that those who claim otherwise have a heavy responsibility. Firstly, they are seriously underestimating the impact of the current Community acquis that this directive, if it is adopted, will fit into. On top of the treaties themselves, current jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, to which Commissioner McCreevy has just referred insistently and very significantly, systematically protects businesses that provide services on the basis of the country of origin principle, and consistently criticises the rules of the host country that are accused of hindering the activities of those businesses. Faced with this hijacking of sovereignty, I think that we need to organise a proper counter-offensive if we are going to put a brake on the race to the bottom with the social acquis. By removing all explicit references to the country of destination principle, though, the compromise reached by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats leaves itself open to the harassment of the Commission and the Court. The supporters of this compromise also greatly overestimate, in my view, the effect of the social guarantees they claim to have introduced into the draft directive. For example, all a business based in a country with less rigorous social standards will have to do is provide its services throughout the EU using 'self-employed' people, and the host country will lose the right to require it to comply with local rules. Another example: it has been said that the provisions on the posting of workers now included in the draft directive make it possible to ensure that employees in other Member States stick to the maximum working time. Big deal! I would remind you that the maximum working week is 48 hours in the EU and even 65 hours in some countries. These same provisions are also supposed to guarantee respect for the collective agreements. In fact, nothing is less certain. This is a grey area in Community law, as was recently acknowledged by the spokesman of the Commission's 'Internal Market and Services' Directorate-General. In such an uncertain context, we must rule out any ambiguity, any half measure and any room for interpretation given to the Commission and the Court. The right message to give them is clear: we must reject the directive in Thursday's vote and, if we do not succeed in that now, it will remain our aim throughout the process. In the meantime, my group will, at the very least, work to insert into the directive a specific reference to the precedence of the rules of the country of destination and to limit the scope of the text as much as possible, in particular by excluding all public services. From the Atlantic to the Baltic, from Lapland to the Peloponnese, we say yes to equality, yes to solidarity, yes to the promotion of the rights of all, and thus no to the Bolkestein directive. In this spirit, I join with you, Mr President, in warmly welcoming to Strasbourg the tens of thousands of employees who have come to defend their rights and a concept of a Europe in which they can once again find their way.

Mr President, Mr Solana, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Winkler, I should like to seize the opportunity, rare as it is, of Mr Solana’s being present in this Chamber to touch on one or two aspects of the common foreign and security policy that are particularly problematic for my group. I will base my remarks in particular on the Operational Programme of the Council for 2006, since that is the most recent background paper. What can be observed? Firstly, the disproportionate importance accorded to the military dimension of the CFSP. It is with outright greed that the Programme lists one by one the catalogues of forces, the rapid response operations, the battle groups, the European Defence Agency and the strategic partnership between the European Union and NATO. The 25 thus have the impression that they are playing with the big boys, but their self-importance is illusory and misplaced. On the other hand – and this is my second observation – the large open wounds in some of the most sensitive regions in the world, wounds that specifically require some political creativity from Europe in the face of the irresponsible approach of the US leaders and their allies are, for their part, sidelined in the CFSP agenda. Thus, in the Operational Programme for 2006, it is the case that, in 14 pages of text, the Near East is disposed of in less than two and a half lines used to reveal to us, and I quote, that: ‘The European Union will continue its efforts to implement the road map’. There is not a single word on the Israeli leaders’ choice of a unilateral strategy, which clearly runs counter to the spirit of the road map and to any peace process. Iraq, for its part, warrants three lines, but there is no mention whatsoever of the war nor of the catastrophic Bush strategy, which lands us all into a tragic deadlock. This brings me to our main criticism, which I already had the opportunity to voice in this very Chamber in June 2003 at the time of the publication of your report on the European security strategy – which is still in force, Mr Solana. The report gives an apocalyptic description of the new threats without once analysing their root causes, and it is with sheer disbelief that one reads - I quote - that ‘by working together, the European Union and the United States can be a major force for good in the world’. So what is your assessment, Mr Solana, of two years of implementation of this strategy? Has the world become a safer and fairer place? To my mind, a good yardstick against which to judge this is the case of the Near East, to which I am now going to turn my attention. While we are on this subject, allow me to point out to our fellow Members the presence, in our galleries, of Mrs Leïla Shahid, Palestine’s new delegate-general to the European Union, whom I should like warmly to welcome. (Applause)
 Even before the Palestinian elections, I had called for Parliament’s agenda to include the issue of the European diplomats’ harsh but accurate report on Jerusalem, which the Council kept secret so as not to affect its relations with the Israeli authorities. Where are we with this matter today? Like a number of my fellow Members, I have just returned from Palestine, where we were observing the legislative elections. We were all pleased and moved to observe the exemplary way in which the ballot was held there, the festive atmosphere in the streets, despite the occupation, and the way in which we, as foreigners, were welcomed. This pride in being able to show the world the Palestinian people’s ability to build its democracy is a major asset for the future that the election result must not have us forget. The same is true of the Palestinians’ desire to make peace with neighbouring Israel and to have two peoples and two States, which were subjects that featured in all of the conversations we were able to have. Anyone who took the risk of starving these women, men and children, or indeed of radicalising them, by cutting off their vital aid, would therefore be shouldering a heavy responsibility. Instead, let us count on the aspirations for democracy and for a just peace, which very much have the upper hand in today’s Palestinian society and which any Palestinian authority will have to take into account. It is the very future of the partnership between the two regions that is at stake. As for the election result, let us be careful not to analyse it purely from an internal Palestinian perspective. Certainly, the popular rejection of Fatah is genuine. Any hegemonic power tends to become divorced from society. Yet, how can one fail to see that the Palestinian Authority has above all lost its credibility with the citizens because it has not succeeded in improving their lot or in offering them new prospects due to the blocked peace process? After the high hopes of ten years ago, the feeling is now one of extreme exasperation in the face of the continuing occupation, the development of settlements, the construction of the wall, the ‘targeted’ assassinations, the arrests, the detention of prisoners, the daily violence and the worsening living conditions as a result of the territories being sealed off. As for the Palestinian State and as for Jerusalem, the Palestinian Authority is seen as having accepted a great deal and as having obtained very little. What should be done, then? There is no doubt that, as you said, Mr Solana, we should put pressure on Hamas to stop the violence and assassination attempts. What are you saying to the Israeli authorities, though? I have heard nothing on this matter. We also need clearly to show that, as far as we are concerned, there is no ‘variable geometry’ version of international law. Like any State, Israel has a duty to comply with the Security Council resolutions. It also has to follow the recommendations of the International Court of Justice. It has to implement its obligations under the road map. In that context, Mr President, it stands to reason that, now more than ever, the attitude to be adopted with regard to our diplomats’ report on Jerusalem is this: we must publish it straightaway, implement its recommendations and, more generally, finally choose a real alternative to President Bush’s strategy, which has failed in the Near East and, beyond, in the Middle East. Let us be alert to the cries of alarm rising up from societies on the verge of despair.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Schüssel, your Presidency is getting off to a good start, what with Parliament probably challenging the directive on the liberalisation of port services, the general outcry against the draft financial perspective at the European Council and so on. You have inherited a minefield. Good luck! Some of your predecessors saw their image go from one of triumphant self-confidence to one of pitiful weakness, all in the space of six months. You are embarking on your Presidency with more modesty, and I think you are right to do so. I will dwell only on one passage from your memorandum. When you mention the debate on the Constitution, you write in paragraph 8:  (DE) 
We are trying to restore a higher level of receptiveness to people’s concerns about the preservation of the European way of life in the context of globalisation. It is a matter of rebuilding trust in the Union’s political decision-makers.  (FR) 
There lies the rub, in fact. Yet in the current climate of the people’s disaffection with the European institutions, words are no longer enough: practical, clear and convincing acts are required. As an illustrious ancestor used to say: ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating’. With this in mind, I can see no more meaningful a gesture right now than that of a clear and public call for the rejection or the definitive withdrawal of the draft Services Directive and of any other text drawing its inspiration from the same liberal principles. Last Thursday, my group brought together in Brussels, to discuss the future of Mr Bolkestein’s symbolic text, more than 200 social actors from throughout the Union, from the confederal secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation to the representatives of the social forum from Poland and Romania, in addition to a large number of local, regional and national elected representatives. All of them expressed their strong opposition to the Commission’s text, which was described as being very dangerous by the leaders of the ETUC, for example. Mr Schüssel, you yourself took note at Hampton Court, in October, of the phenomenal way in which this draft directive attracted real opposition in the majority of our countries, once our fellow citizens became aware of its content. According to some indiscreet sources, you said: ‘We cannot save it; we must withdraw it’. In our opinion, withdrawing the text is actually the path we should be taking, but not with a view to coming back with a new and slightly amended draft - a ‘watered-down Bolkestein’, as one of the leaders of ATTAC described it during our meeting on Thursday. In truth, this matter has served to reveal what an increasing number of Europeans no longer want: workers being pitted against one another, and their social benefits and rights being levelled down as a consequence. It is this same logic that is rejected by all the port workers throughout the Union, irrespective of which trade union they belong to. The same goes for the Swedish workers involved in the very symbolic Vaxholm case. Other similar reports are reaching us from countries such as Finland, Scotland and Ireland. As the years have gone by, we have surreptitiously gone from having European integration achieved through harmonisation of national legislation - that is to say through political acts and through votes, which at least gave us hope that we could harmonise from the top down – to integration achieved through the market, that is to say through unfettered competition, which naturally tends to lead to a levelling down. You will not gain the confidence of Europeans, Mr President, without making a clean break with this liberal way of thinking, so as to really place the employee and the citizen – and no longer the market – at the centre of the European project. It is primarily in this light that your Presidency will be judged in six months’ time. (Applause from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left)

Mr President, my colleague, Mr Markov, had very clearly requested that we proceed to an electronic count of the vote on Amendment 1. I believe that the balance of power was the same as that for the vote on Amendment 3. I should therefore like a scrutiny of the vote on Amendment 1.

 Mr President, the period of reflection decreed by the European Council following the victory of the 'no' camp in France and the Netherlands has achieved its first result: it has improved people's manners. For example, the two co-rapporteurs of the resolution we are now debating did not consider it appropriate this time to describe the majority of the electorate in France and the Netherlands with the unkind epithets that some levelled at them a few months ago. I would therefore like to thank Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Duff for emphasising here, at least in their resolution, that the citizens have in fact, and I quote, 'expressed concerns and worries which need to be taken into account', and that we need to respect their decision and 'to analyse carefully the reasons for the negative results'. That is a step forward. This would be even clearer if the report stated that the draft treaty is now dead and that the debate now centres on what should replace it. My group is prepared to take an active part in the debate on the future of the Union with our fellow citizens. As regards the topics put forward for those discussions, we agree with them in essence. The question that arises is this: what will be the political result of this debate? How far are you prepared to go in transforming the policies and structures of the EU as it is, in order to meet the demands being made by most of Europe's societies, which were demonstrated most spectacularly by the rejection of the constitutional treaty? That is where the problem lies. The report now before us proposes only, and I quote, 'to reassure … public opinion', given that, and again I quote, 'in any case … the Constitution enters into force during 2009'. In that case, it is no longer a debate, but a communication campaign. It would be a shame if we followed that route. It would be a missed opportunity. That is why my group, almost without exception, will not go down that path.

Mr President, last June, the majority of Parliament warmly welcomed Mr Blair. Six months later, the chairmen of the political groups took a very unusual step and unanimously rejected his budgetary proposals on the grounds, I quote, ‘of a lack of solidarity’. The President of the Commission has just made a speech along the same lines, and our entire debate could not be clearer. This turnaround in the situation ought to make the outgoing Presidency reflect. The UK Presidency’s offhand manner towards its partners in general and to the new Member States in particular has, this time round, crossed the threshold between what is acceptable and what is not. How can one dare envisage resolving Britain’s internal political and budgetary quarrels on the back of the new Member States, which have the most need of Community funds, while at the same time professing to be the champion of enlargement? On the one hand, the new Member States would be granted EUR 14 billion less in appropriations than what was proposed in the June compromise, the amount of which was itself meagre. On the other hand, Great Britain, on account of its notorious rebate, would benefit from an extra EUR 12 billion in savings in comparison with what had been envisaged six months earlier. This is a Thatcher-style touch that could cost us dear. As for the desire expressed by the Presidency-in-Office to reform the CAP with a view to making it fairer, let us leave it to the 7 December issue of the Financial Times 
to assess the sincerity of that desire. I quote: ‘When the Commission proposed to set a ceiling on the size of the farms eligible for subsidies during the last reform of the CAP, the initiative was blocked by the United Kingdom because the latter has fewer small farms than the other Member States’. The great European principles of the current Presidency obviously stop at the point where major domestic interests come into play. Thus, it took a fair amount of composure to look down on the new Member States, as Mr Straw did, by comparing the funds allocated to these countries in the forthcoming financial perspective to two Marshall Plans, even though, according to your Foreign Secretary’s own figures, the cheque would, to all intents and purposes, amount to nothing less than a 2000-2013 Marshall Plan exclusively for Great Britain, the fifth global economic power. This is no longer about Europe; it is about winning the lottery. Let us not allow the bad old days of ‘I want my money back’ to return with a vengeance. The letter from the six biggest net contributors announcing, two years ago, that they intended to limit future budgets to 1% of gross national product sadly re-opened this dead end. Mr Blair leapt unrestrainedly into the breach. We must arrest this wayward trend while there is still time. It appears that we are in the middle of a period of reflection on the direction to be taken by the European adventure. It seems to me that the time has come to choose between integration via the market and political integration, between fierce rivalry and solidarity and between capitulation and ambition. We will soon see who really wants Europe.

 Mr President, we must not despair of anything or anyone, even if Mr Mandelson is beginning to believe that, and I quote, whatever we offer will not be enough for such highly competitive and aggressive producers and exporters as Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. It is not therefore too late for the 25 to seriously revise their negotiator’s mandate, which for the most part dates back to 1999, that is before the double failure of Seattle and Cancún. My Group is therefore pleased to submit to you ten proposals for closely linked new priorities, which I will call the ten commandments of an alternative view of Europe’s ambition on the international stage. Firstly, given that tomorrow is World Aids Day, I will mention the requirement to find a definitive solution to the problem of access to medicines in countries that have no pharmaceutical production capacity. The persistent blockages, in the name of intellectual and industrial property, are criminal and unacceptable in this respect. Secondly, I will mention the Doha Round’s official priority, which has been completely marginalised in practice: development. One after another, Europe has sacrificed all the gains of Lomé on the altar of the WTO –Stabex, Sysmin, the banana agreement, the sugar protocol – in order to get free-trade agreements signed, with the bonus of the introduction of visas for nationals of the countries we used to call our privileged partners. We believe there needs to be a reversal of approach in this regard so that we never again see tragedies such as those of Lampedusa, Ceuta, Mellila or elsewhere. Thirdly, I will mention agriculture. We are in favour of defending genuine European small farming, the right to guaranteed remunerative prices, the principle of food sovereignty, respect for the social, environmental and territorial multifunctionality of agriculture. What we need to fight is the obsession with productivity, dumping practices that destabilise the weak economies of the South and make them more dependent, and the all-out liberalisation that gives the multinationals access to land, seed, water and the market for goods and services. The time I am allowed obliges me to mention our other priorities very briefly. Four, the WTO must prohibit the patenting of living things and protect local communities’ biological resources and technological knowledge against biopiracy. Five, health, education, culture, audiovisual services, water and all public services must be expressly excluded from any trade agreement. We are against the GATS and in favour of designating world public goods as outside the scope of the market. Six, the cultural exemption: no WTO rule must prevent a state from defending what it considers its cultural heritage. Seven, employment and training in all parts of the world must become objectives in their own right towards which economic agreements must work; this is the opposite of the liberalisation that is destabilising whole sections of industry and services. Eight, social and environmental standards. Instead of the obsession with cost cutting, there must be mandatory and constantly upgraded minimum standards, and the countries in greatest difficulty must be given compensatory aid. Nine, the WTO must be democratised as a matter of urgency, each member country enabled to take part in the talks on equal terms, the transparency of the debates guaranteed and elected representatives involved in the decision-making process. Finally, ten, the WTO must be incorporated into the United Nations system with a hierarchy of international law standards giving primacy to fundamental rights and in particular to international conventions on the rules of international trade. Mr President, if the EU is able to draw inspiration from an approach of this kind, I think its existential crisis will begin to look like a bad memory.

Mr President, the situation has changed, inasmuch as Mr Poettering, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has finally come round to the position held by his group, which was the position that I myself had upheld at the Conference of Presidents. It consisted of saying that no tactical consideration whatsoever should prevent Parliament from expressing its opinion on the urgency of the human rights situation in Western Sahara (Applause)
 and that, before sending a delegation, it would make more sense for Parliament to outline its position on, in particular, the very recent and serious revelations involving the discovery of common graves, to enable it to highlight this issue and to call on the Moroccan authorities and, indeed, everyone to work with the new UN representative. I therefore welcome the position outlined a few moments ago, which will undoubtedly be the one upheld by our entire Assembly, namely that in favour of holding a vote at the end of our debate this afternoon.

Mr President, Mr Blair, Mr Barroso, the speech made by Mr Blair in June included at least three indisputable observations: firstly, that a serious crisis of confidence exists between our fellow citizens and the European institutions; secondly, that the idea of Europe’s having led 20 million people into unemployment needs to be changed; and, thirdly, that it would be useful to start a fundamental debate on what the European social model needs to be today. Everything is fine up to that point. On the last point – the social model – the British Prime Minister even appeared to have a recommendation to make to the whole of Europe, which he himself embodies in his own country. Is it not the case that unemployment in the United Kingdom has been reduced to 5% of the active population? Such a success story deserved to be examined in more depth. What is therefore so special about this Blair model, given that the priorities of the UK Presidency are in perfect harmony with those of the entire Union? What could be more Blair-like, in actual fact, than the action plan of the Lisbon Agenda, revised in 2005? Yet the fact is that, in the United Kingdom, unlike in other Member States, the majority of these reforms have already been, or are due to be, carried out in full. It therefore seemed a good idea to my group, before the extraordinary meeting at Hampton Court takes place, to discover how this pilot experiment carried out by a 21st century liberal Europe is assessed by those it affects most – the British themselves. We therefore listened for two whole days last week in London to what members of the main trade unions, members of feminist movements, members of Parliament from the Labour Party and employees of British universities had to say. The least that can be said is that what we learned does not lead us to believe that this type of model might enable the Union to overcome the peoples’ disaffection with Europe. Turning our attention, now, to the matter of employment. Our speakers listed the numerous devices used to bring down unemployment figures. Hence, the United Kingdom has more than two million people classed as suffering from long term illness and others classed as being unable to work. As if by chance, only 2% of people are classed as unable to work in a well-off town in the south of England, while in the poor region of South Wales, the equivalent figure is 32%. Our speakers also told us that there is a enormous lack of job security, particularly for women, three-fifths of whom work part-time in underpaid jobs with no prospects, while the men suffer some of the longest working hours in Europe. The extent of poverty was another aspect of the situation highlighted by our British friends. In addition to a large number of unemployed and working poor, one female pensioner in four lives in poverty in the United Kingdom. Child poverty has even reached the staggering figure of 54% in inner city London. On the subject of public services: although no one denied the increase in spending that has taken place over the last three years, we were told – and I quote – that the benefits offered, and methods used, in the public sector have been modelled on those of the private sector, with profitability as a concern. Ten thousand hospital beds have thus been done away with in the last eight years. Summing up the general feeling, one researcher told us that, in our society, citizens are all too often left to their own devices, faced with market forces. Go on, laugh, ladies and gentlemen, I am talking about what the representatives of the social forces in the United Kingdom told us. Go on, laugh. On the other hand, a wonderful breath of fresh air of humanity came to us from our meeting with the trade unionists who organised an illegal solidarity strike this summer at British Airways involving the 800 male and female immigrant employees of the US sub-contractor Gate Gourmet, all of whom had just been made redundant so that their jobs might be filled by other, less costly, employees. Together they fought back and won, and dignity too prevailed. Mr President, it is our conviction that the notion of the European social model is too precious to be tarnished. It does not sit well with the cold and detached laws of the market. When people finally sit up and take note of this obvious fact, then, and only then, will Europe fare better.

Mr President, my group naturally supports the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the dispute that has brought it into conflict with Mr McCreevy and with the Commission in general. How could we, on the left, accept a concept of Europe founded on creating competition among workers and on organising social dumping? It is exactly this kind of policy that we have in mind when we say ‘no’ to liberal Europe. What really grates is the fact that that brutal agitator, Mr McCreevy, and all those who share his opinions unfortunately can rely on rules in force in the EU in giving their support to a Latvian business claiming not to know about Sweden’s system of collective agreements and in applying more restrictive social standards. The provision to which, in this case, the Latvian service provider and its promoters in Brussels are referring is called mutual recognition, which was introduced into Community law, via the case law of the Court of Justice, in 1979 for the free circulation of goods and was then expanded to incorporate services around 15 years ago. This is a strategic choice. Instead of legislating on upwards social harmonisation, the market and competition are being allowed to pull the social acquis 
downwards: in Community jargon, this is what is known as better regulation. Moreover, the Commission issued in 1999 a communication to Parliament and to the Council that was extremely explicit on this matter. I quote: ‘The application of mutual recognition is fully consistent with the Single Market philosophy according to which the rules of the Member State of origin normally prevail, and the Member State of destination can only derogate from that rule under very strict conditions challenging the overriding requirements of general public importance, such as health care, consumer protection or the environment.’ With the most recent enlargement, this rule has become explosive: the more social disparities increase among Member States, the more they reveal the diabolical consequences of this rule. From now on, everything will depend on what the Court considers to come under the ‘overriding requirements of general public importance’. It is therefore not only a question of attacking Mr McCreevy’s zeal, but also of opposing the harmful provisions themselves of the acquis communautaire
. From now on, let us consider this matter from the perspective of the forthcoming votes on the draft Bolkestein Directive, whatever Mr Poettering might have to say about it, and let us use this experience more generally to enhance our collective thoughts on the future of Europe. (Applause from the left)

 Mr President, if I thoroughly support Mr Schulz’s request that Mr McCreevy and the President of the Commission be simultaneously invited to express their opinions, it is because Mr McCreevy can be relied on not to pull his punches. I think he is used to saying bluntly what a number of his colleagues in the Commission dress up. For example, Mr McCreevy declared at a conference in London that it must never be forgotten that the single market is far and away the project that goes furthest in terms of deregulating the European Union. We therefore want to know whether, when Mr McCreevy expresses his opinion, he in fact says bluntly and without beating about the bush what Mr Barroso does not dare to say in public. That is why I suggest that, on these issues, they both express their opinions in this Chamber.

 Mr President, I totally support Mrs Buitenweg’s request, because this is not just any old debate on immigration. We shall have other such debates, moreover. The problem is that, this time, men have died. On this subject, I am sorry that, at the start of the sitting, we did not pay tribute to these innocent victims. (Applause)
 Extremely serious acts have been committed on both sides of Europe’s southern border, acts so serious that even colleagues who do not see European immigration policy in the same terms as ourselves could, I think, join us in deploring and condemning them. That is why I fully support changing the title and specifying ‘Ceuta, Melilla’.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, repeated accidents and an increase in the transport of dangerous goods by sea constantly raise acute issues regarding strengthening the safety rules governing all maritime straits in the European Union and the resources needed in order to enforce these rules. In particular, it makes sense to classify these straits and approach routes to them in accordance with the procedure relating to ‘Seveso zones’, because transport must come down to a drive to reduce costs whatever the consequences. The Commission and the Council, under pressure from economic disasters set off by the financial crisis, are finally thinking about calling tax havens into question. If this can actually be put into action, it could be a real step forward. Along the same lines, how many more maritime and environmental disasters do we need to have before the Commission, the Council and this Parliament will finally turn their attention to the long-standing scandal of flags of convenience? Perhaps, though, it would be wiser for the European electorate to fill Parliament with more MEPs who care more about working for the safety of their fellow citizens than about standing up for free trade, which destroys people and the environment.

Madam President, there is no point in denying it: during the July negotiations, the Bush Administration and the European Union were caught in their own trap by India and China. What is more, contrary to the hypocritical assertions of liberal economists, for whom the failure of Doha would have been a disaster for poor countries, it was no such thing. On the contrary, for these countries in difficulty it represented an historic opportunity, in a context marked by significant fluctuations in the prices of raw materials. Even the experts admit, the gains that the poorest countries could have hoped for were well below the tax losses caused by the demise of customs duties in these same countries, duties that would have reached the sum of USD 60 billion. During these negotiations, the Commission, tangled up as it is in its liberal dogmas, displayed a total lack of responsibility towards the people of Europe, going so far as to propose damaging, even sacrificing, car manufacturing on EU territory in order to succeed in reaching an agreement. As far as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Commission are concerned, there are only consumers and never wealth creators. It is this take on matters that is at the root of the current crisis since, by making competition the be-all and end-all of everything, it is pushing us in the direction of yet more salary deflation, and hence the absolute impoverishment of workers and the methodical destruction of all social protection. Were the Doha Round to be concluded, it would be a disaster for all nations. Moreover, what is particularly painful in the current context is the fact that, in spite of the considerable damage recorded having been taken on board, there is a desire to continue in the wrong direction, no matter what the cost. There is an urgent need to revolutionise the WTO so that democracy may be established there.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, be serious! Despite a few positive measures, the majority of the reports being proposed to us will never have any more therapeutic value than a plaster on a wooden leg, as far as maritime safety is concerned. Parliament and the Commission pretend to get cross with the Council, but this play-acting is no more than another crude attempt to bury responsibilities and favour private interests to the detriment of the general interest. All this will do is give the European institutions even less legitimacy in the eyes of the people if there is another disaster, especially with the knowledge that the European Union is engaged in the WTO general trade agreement, known as GATS, whose Commission on Maritime Transport says that the current maritime transport environmental and safety regulations are excessive and should be relaxed. The inhabitants of the communities that were the victims of the Erika
 shipwreck and others will appreciate the EU’s cynicism. Properly addressing the problems of maritime transport safety means grasping the evil by the root. We should be attacking the tax havens that allow maritime transport activities to be segmented into a jungle of shell corporations that offer the possibility of sidestepping the regulations. We need to bring an end to the practice of flags of convenience – including on EU territory – which reduce registration fees and cut crew costs by 60% on average. Above all, we need to give new rights to employees as regards safety. You will never do this, though, because it would mean attacking the very foundations of globalised capitalism.

 Mr President, 51 years into their lifetime, the EU institutions are only now discovering the social dimension. The discovery is only relative, because social concerns are conspicuously absent from the French Presidency's priorities; it is disturbing to institutions so close to the world of business and which confuse the general interest of the peoples of the Union with the private interests of money markets, and it is a discovery inescapably prompted by the Irish, Dutch and French 'no' votes and the many social movements supporting wage demands in the Union. Yes, the Commission and most of this House find themselves obliged to recognise that the Union is populated not only by shareholders and consumers, but also by the workforce, whose labour creates Europe's wealth. As a result the Commission finds itself obliged to dig out and dust off the directive on European works councils: this was a worthy initiative but its substance is poor. European works councils must be made into a genuine forum for social democracy, giving employees the power of action they need to influence the strategy choices of their employers. Yes, Europe urgently needs true social democracy to prevent bad moves such as raising working time to almost 70 hours a week. So for the sake of the workers, let us move faster, much faster.

Mr President, when it comes to gas and to energy in general, we are faced with two radically opposed approaches. The liberal approach consists of treating gas and its supply as a good and a service just like any other, giving rise to uncontrolled competition and totally excessive dismantlement of integrated public service companies. Inevitably, prices rise, the services provided deteriorate and commercial and marketing spending shoots up to the detriment of research and development, and to the detriment of security. What is worse, it generates harmful competition among the various forms of energy, thereby encouraging short-term choices based on the sole criterion of maximum profit in the minimum amount of time. That approach forms the basis for the reports presented to us. There is another approach, however, which consists of treating energy, gas and their supply as a public service that should be provided to all on the basis of equality and territorial adjustments. That would result in a real Europe of energy based on cooperation and the general interest. It would be built around a European energy agency that would coordinate and pool all the research efforts of the Member States and would guarantee equal access to energy for all citizens. It would be based on an economic interest grouping integrating European energy companies, both public and private. This EIG would carry out within a framework of cooperation major industrial projects at EU level and would enable our resources to be pooled.

 Madam President, the WTO dispute between Airbus and Boeing is nothing more than a bad joke. The Americans are trying to oppose the superiority of Airbus by any means possible, even resorting to the courts. However, while Airbus has received repayable financing, Boeing is collapsing under the weight of funding from different countries, and particularly under the enormous weight of military research. This is why the Dreamliner is the most subsidised aeroplane in the world. What is really behind the unfair competition in this case is the weak dollar. Unfortunately, the US is complicit in this matter with the European Central Bank. The real question, therefore, is whether or not Airbus will continue to design and manufacture its aircraft in the euro area. To say yes would mean the European Central Bank being at the beck and call of industry, rather than refinancing investment banks without any guarantee of repayment. To say yes would mean creating a sovereign European public fund, which would replace the private shareholders of EADS, who have shown their inability to develop a relevant industrial strategy, instead preferring to protect their dividends. Replacing the A320 with an aircraft offering a 20% fuel saving will only be possible with the kind of investment that the shareholders are unwilling to make. Europe needs a strong EADS group that is 100% public-owned if it wants an industrial policy that is able to provide it with its own energy-efficient air transport.

This third energy package dogmatically persists in following the course of total separation between the energy production side and the distribution networks. It is aimed at subjecting the entire energy sector solely to the laws of the free market and to everyone competing with everyone else. As the same causes produce the same effects this will lead the European Union to an even bigger disaster than that experienced by California in the year 2000. This policy is bad for consumers, bad for the industry’s employees, bad for SMEs and SMIs, bad for jobs, bad for security and bad for the environment. The market and the private sector are incapable of meeting the energy needs of Europeans and of responding to the challenges of global warming and the post fossil fuel era. Their prime objective is to pay out as much as possible to their shareholders, not to act in the general interests of the nation. We need a proper internal market for energy in Europe and this will only be achieved on the basis of cooperation. The energy sector needs to be guided by coordinated public action from the Member States, not by the activities of the financial markets. The EU has to take steps to ensure that energy is recognised as a global public resource and not as just another commodity to be bought and sold.

 Mr President, every fishing port in the European Union is urgently calling for two things: fuel oil at a standard price Europe-wide of 40 cents a litre and concerted management of quotas. These legitimate demands are vital to the fisheries industry and to the jobs it provides. The huge hike in oil prices and the preservation of fish stocks are real problems. The free market is proving incapable of controlling the impact of the rising fuel prices. Swelled-up with profits the oil companies respond by speculating on the increased demand for their products in the emerging nations, hoping thereby to burst the bank. By reducing the tax on fuel, which is forever increasing, and taxing the colossal profits of the oil companies we could easily meet the demands of the fishermen without the need for subsidies, especially those paid out haphazardly. What is more, the fishermen will no longer accept being treated like delinquents of the sea by a Commission that is covering up for the real rogues that are the flags of convenience and the fishing industry cartels. No one is more committed than the fishermen to the conservation of marine stocks. The system needs to be completely reformed and the Commission should be working democratically with the professionals of the fishing industry rather than imposing a dictatorship based on the rule of its pseudo experts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sole objective of this report and today’s discussions is simply to conceal a glaring reality in the European Union: industry is in crisis and the damage being caused is substantial. The figures provided are certainly dream-like: 80%, 73%. They could well have been replaced with billions of euros to show them off to everyone. They fool no one, however. They do nothing but hide the real state of affairs. One of the major concerns of industry as a whole is that the only thing that counts is the profit margin. The endangered species of captains of industry has now been replaced by sombre-talking slot machines. No matter what decisions are taken and their consequences for the women and men of Europe, profit must be as high as possible and it must be immediate. I am well aware that some people will tell me that never has so much been invested, produced, exchanged and earned by industry. That is true, but what is the significance of huge financial reward benefiting a handful of people when most are suffering and seeing their little dreams of happiness going up in smoke? We cannot fail to see that the theme of employment is not a feature of this report, and nor are the concepts of land planning, population needs, taxation and social issues. The fact of the matter is that the commercial success of major industrial groups in Europe is now making ever smaller contributions to EU development. The large European groups are relocating and outsourcing to countries that operate dumping in terms of wages, welfare, health, taxes and the environment, and meanwhile the EU refuses to enact any industrial policy. This policy is also strangling small and medium-sized enterprises and encouraging them to do the same. It is obvious it is not the … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, we cannot seriously discuss the issue of carriage of goods by road without tackling the problem of dangerous materials. In the texts being proposed to us today, as elsewhere in European legislation, this problem is either underestimated or poorly dealt with. Yet if there is an area in which we need more from Europe, more restricting Community regulations, it is this one. As many businesses put their dangerous materials on the roads in order to prevent their establishments from being classified as a ‘Seveso site’, the flows of dangerous materials circulating around the Union are constantly growing, thus increasing the risks of a major catastrophe. With regard to the carriage of dangerous materials by road, there is a huge lack of training, a major shortage of equipment in terms of parking areas that can safely take the vehicles concerned in accordance with Community regulations. The danger of mixed loads is sorely underestimated. Goods that are harmless when taken separately can become dangerous if they are in the same parking area; currently, people are quite simply unaware of this danger. I argue in favour of the creation of a European agency for the safety of land carriage of dangerous materials to promote a truly comprehensive safety policy at Union level.

Madam President, the only thing we will agree on is the urgent need to revolutionise the WTO. The WTO, like the IMF, is an illegitimate, anti-democratic and dangerous organisation as far as the people’s interests are concerned. It was initially set up to ensure the financial and industrial hegemony of the United States and major transnational groups. The Union has, of course, slavishly put itself at the beck and call of this system, in the hope of gathering a few crumbs from the table of the American master. This unbridled free trade has today turned against its founders and the planet’s centre of economic gravity has swung towards the East and Asia in particular, resulting in the most terrible financial and food crises the world has ever experienced. There are few countries that yesterday were classed as emerging nations, went on to become predators and then renounced their role as predators in the name of some benevolent objective or another, with the entire global trading system built around the WTO encouraging them to continue along that path. The rules for all players are to get rich as quickly as possible, irrespective of the means, including speculation on medicines or basic foodstuffs. In the Union the inequalities have exploded and the working and middle classes are getting poorer and poorer. The food crisis affecting the poorest populations is a direct consequence of the WTO’s policy aimed at destroying subsistence crops to the benefit of export crops. Biofuels are merely the easy scapegoat of a mercenary system that must be revolutionised as soon as possible. I want to take this opportunity to denounce the irresponsible comments of Mr Mandelson, who called for further deregulation of the agricultural markets at a time when the World Food Programme is highlighting the surge in food prices and calling it, and I quote, ‘a silent tsunami threatening to plunge more than 100 million people into hunger’. Does Mr Mandelson thus want to go down in history under the shameful epithet of someone who was responsible for starvation? The WTO must therefore be revolutionised in order to curb speculation and support producers rather than a minority of profiteers benefiting the global financial markets, so as to encourage the populations to become independent in terms of food and industry and to urge the nations to cooperate rather than compete.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, theoretically the common agricultural policy was meant to guarantee food safety, stability for EU production and prices, and also a decent income for all farmers. Unfortunately, in the name of the dogma of savage competition, CAP 2003 and its aid decoupling system constitute another step towards abandoning these objectives, even though they are vital European components. Single payment entitlements contribute to the serious difficulties in sectors such as wine, milk, meat, beetroot, fruit and vegetables. The entitlements’ environmental cross-compliance principle is nothing more than a trick devised to sell this reform to Bohemians who pass themselves off as environmentalists merely because it is fashionable to do so. How can we possibly imagine it is possible to increase our protection of the environment by stimulating competition in the agricultural sector and bringing down the prices of foodstuffs at the same time? The two requirements are contradictory: it is impossible to combine lower production costs with an increase in environmental regulations. In the same way, the immediate consequence of decoupling the premium for maintaining suckler cows would be the disappearance of the natural carbon-absorbing meadows, which are particularly effective in combating greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting the planet and maintaining production of quality European beef mean that decoupling must be rejected. In a more general context, what we actually need is another agricultural policy.

 Mr President, on 6 December the Strasbourg industrial tribunal issued its decision in the case of the European Parliament versus some of its employees. I quote: ‘Notes that the assignment contract between Manpower and the European Parliament is invalid; notes that the project contract between Manpower with the employees is invalid; states and rules that the contractual relationship between the applicant employee and the European Parliament should be put on a permanent contract footing’. I applaud here the courage of the temporary officials, who ignored bullying and other provocation in order to have their rights recognised. I dare to hope, Mr President, that the administration will very quickly be instructed to bring a definitive end to this case, since all it will have done is discredit our institution in the eyes of the employment world.

 Mr President, in relation to this apparently technical issue of interoperability of the European railway system and the role of the European Railway Agency in terms of safety, we find ourselves at the heart of a genuine choice between civilisations. Either the EU implements a European railway market based on competition of ‘everyone against everyone else’ and the dismembering of national railway companies in the vague hope of retaining the proper safety levels – this is what the Commission’s proposals mean – or we make arrangements for cooperation between all the Member State rail companies to implement a network throughout the EU to transport passengers and freight at high speed in all safety. The latter could be achieved by developing the Railteam alliance, bringing together the main European high-speed operators. We should note that European railway history has already made a decision between the two systems. Great Britain implemented the choices that the Commission is now proposing on its own rail network ten years ago. The result: a general deterioration in the service, and a deterioration in safety leading to fatal accidents. On the other hand, ten years ago Thalys was set up on the basis of cooperation between the SNCF and the SNCB, despite opposition by the Commission. The result: an efficient, safe, quality service in response to passengers’ needs. On the strength of this historical experience, I wish to ask the Commission to abandon its choice of railway competition in favour of cooperation.

The explanations provided by the Commission confirm that, as far as the United States is concerned, liberalism is above all a commodity for export. It is clear that in this area, as in many others, we are often ready to give ourselves enough rope to hang ourselves. The US and Japanese Governments assist Boeing massively through military orders and public and public-private research. Thus, as already mentioned here, the Boeing 787 will be the most subsidised civil aircraft in history. The Commission must unfailingly defend Airbus in the WTO. That is its duty and the citizens will judge it on the results. Airbus benefits from the system of repayable loans: it is an appropriate, effective system. It ensures that Airbus does not fall prey to the dictates of the financial markets. It ensures that the states do not lose out on the money they invest in the aviation sector. This system must be complemented by a stronger aviation research sector, which would raise the European effort to the same level as the United States. This is crucial for our ability to compete both today and tomorrow. In fact, there would be no aerospace industry without massive public intervention and support. The incompetence and weakness demonstrated by EADS’ two main private shareholders are proof of this. The Galileo problems illustrate this clearly, too. I firmly believe that the only way of guaranteeing the future of Airbus is to make EADS the first European majority public company. This future proposal was also put forward by numerous trade union activists at the hearing on Airbus organised by my group on 28 March. We believe that the Airbus management must urgently withdraw the Power 8 plan, whose only purpose is to ensure that Airbus’s industrial model is identical to that of Boeing. However, that model is causing problems for Boeing, as illustrated by the very serious difficulties it is experiencing with the industrialisation of its 787 Dreamliner
. Europe needs an aerospace industry that is powerful and that generates employment. To achieve this, it must ensure that the workers have strong powers to intervene in their company’s strategy.

Mr President, the use of just in time delivery by industry and trade, with the ultimate aim, in short, of maximum immediate profit, means that dangerous goods are less and less in warehouses and secure factories and more and more on roads, rivers and railways and at sea. For very many years, the European Commission has been doing everything it can to deregulate the transport sector for the greater benefit of private interests, taking no account of the general interest. So much so that, when anyone raises the issue of public safety, the Commission immediately takes refuge in the subsidiarity principle. As always, the European Commission boasts of having worked closely with employers, forgetting, as always, the workers who might have been able to teach it a great deal, especially about the general deregulation of the transport sector, social dumping, and the refusal to introduce binding legislation on working conditions and training for road transport staff. There is a serious risk of a major disaster involving a dangerous goods consignment in the future. Then those who have made the decisions will be responsible. Yet this Parliament could vote for simple and effective measures, such as the designation of lorry parks as Seveso sites and triage at railway transit points for dangerous goods; imposing a traceability obligation in real time with a system of geographical location of all dangerous goods to ensure that incompatible products are not kept together; and training in the necessary safety measures for the personnel involved. But most people see this as unnecessary expenditure. Well, you can assume that, but do not count on us for support!

Madam President, it is not governance that the Union needs, but political action on its economies in order to promote a form of growth that creates stable and, above all, well-paid, jobs. The European Central Bank is harmful because its sole aim is to have the lowest inflation rate possible, when it should include structural policy elements such as growth, as the US Federal Reserve does. Creating the euro without implementing, at the same time, a federal budget at the level of the Member States concerned has resulted in the demise of the instrument of devaluation, without any other protection methods having been provided. The undervaluation of the dollar is, from this point of view, a weapon for the mass destruction of Europe’s industrial capacities, and your self-satisfied speeches cannot disguise this reality of the exorbitant and unbearable cost of the overvaluation of the euro. Europe’s workers and citizens are paying a very high price for this mistake. The Eurozone can no longer function in its current state; we must, as a matter of urgency, resort to a change in the statute of the European Central Bank and in the organisation itself of the euro. We must, as a matter of urgency, have recourse to customs protections. It is time to implement industrial policies that ensure that the vital interests of the people of Europe are protected and that enable jobs to be created and the common interests of European workers to be protected.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let us dare to put an end to the myth: free trade no longer reduces poverty and no longer stimulates development. The latest studies published by the World Bank evaluate the almost non-existent profits made, and of those almost non-existent profits, the bulk went to China. If we take account of the disappearance of customs duties, the balance sheet becomes particularly negative for developing countries. Capitalist globalisation does not orchestrate competition between the large multinationals; it protects them. On the other hand, it creates a harsh form of competition between the social and fiscal systems that have been chosen democratically by the citizens of each nation. One of the consequences of free trade is, moreover, a wholesale shift of the corporate tax burden onto households. That is why the great sentences in the report about the preservation of the European social model are nothing but dramatic expressions designed to get the tears flowing. If we want to get away from this, we need to replace the principle of free trade with that of fair trade. The fall in the dollar and the yen is bleeding industrial employment dry in the euro zone. And the report invites the Commission to…invite! Tartuffe could not have put it better! There is not a single word on the iniquitous desire to tone down the anti-dumping regulations on the pretext that they harm certain financial interests, namely European ones. Because we are here to serve Europeans and not speculative investment companies, let us choose cooperation over competitiveness, let us choose a form of rational protectionism that relies on social and ecological customs duties, and let us establish a control on exchange and movement of capital. I firmly believe, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that if we persevere with this headlong flight towards free trade, the Union will go straight to the wall, with its foot down, shouting at the top of its voice!

Madam President, the transport sector is vital to the development of our societies. Within this sector, maritime transport becomes more powerful each year and could really improve the environmental and economic landscape. However, for thirty years, the number of ships carrying crude oil, heavy fuel oil and chemicals that have sunk off the coasts of the Union has multiplied, with tragic consequences for economic and leisure activities that are associated with the sea, such as fishing, oyster farming, tourism, pleasure boating, and so many others. One ship goes down every three days. 1 600 sailors die at sea each year. More than 6 000 ships officially recorded as dangerous sail on our oceans each day. This is unacceptable! Taking serious action means forcefully tackling the main cause of a lack of safety at sea. The flags of convenience and tax havens that harbour and protect them, the criminal complicity between the classification societies and the insurance companies – they are responsible for the waste ships, operated by crews who are reduced to near slavery. Given this state of affairs, the inspections carried out in EU ports should focus both on the state of the vessels and on the circumstances of the crew, so as to check that their training, working conditions, pay and state of health are compatible with the safety requirements necessary for navigation. Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, would you board an aircraft that had a crew that was incapable of communicating in a common language, a pilot who had not been paid for three months and a co-pilot who had not had a rest break for six months? Obviously not! Then why accept this for a ship? There is another important issue: the creation of an independent authority to take over the Member States’ job of managing maritime crisis situations is inept. It would be ineffective, dangerous and non-democratic. The track record of most of the Union’s independent authorities, starting with the work of the ECB, is so disastrous for the people of Europe as a whole that I would not hand over responsibility for maritime safety off the coast of my town, Calais, to a pseudo-independent body, whose sole aim would, as ever, be to protect the financial interests of a few large companies. My final remark concerns the plan to fit fishing vessels with an anti-collision system – in other words, a cost of EUR 2 000. Could this cost be borne by charterers and, in particular, by charterers of oil tankers?

 Mr President, Airbus was the cutting-edge industry that was meant to make us swallow the loss of our iron and steel industry and accept the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in textiles, and that same Airbus is now on the rack, preparing to sacrifice its workers and its sub-contractors – quite an achievement for a company whose order books are full for six years and which has EUR 4 billion in the bank. Airbus would be able to face the future with confidence if it were not ravaged by the financial cancer that is free-market liberalism, and I can tell the House that jobs and development do not sit comfortably with a policy of keeping the euro strong nor, above all, with the greed for dividends characteristic of private shareholders who seek to cut back on investment in the necessary human and material resources and who put their trust in financiers rather than in the expertise of the workers. The fact is that, by doing away with 10 000 jobs and dividing by six the number of sub-contractors, the ‘Power 8’ plan is eating away at those things that make Airbus rich: its workers’ know-how and the network of sub-contracting businesses on whose cooperation it could rely. It was that cooperation that made Airbus a high-performing business, and that is the reality of what ‘Power 8’ is going to destroy by making workers, sites and nationalities compete against each other, something that the workers are quite right to repudiate. ‘Power 8’ fails to respond to the present and future needs of the business and should, for that reason, be withdrawn. If Airbus is to overcome its difficulties, a return to largely public ownership and funding is what is called for, for the fact is that only the Member States are capable of taking on aeronautical projects of this size. Moreover, the Commission must resolutely defend before the WTO the system of repayable advances by which means alone it will be possible to fund the A350 and the NSR, and it must also make sure that the company gets low-interest loans from the EIB. If our aerospace industry is to have a future, a European fund for research, employment and training needs to be set up as a matter of urgency. Within the space of ten years, 30% of EADS’ staff are going to be retiring; if their know-how is not to be lost, a massive plan for recruitment and training is called for. The aerospace industry will have immense challenges to cope with – ranging from the revolution in composite materials to the death of oil – and it is our duty to help it do that.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us welcome the fact that our Parliament is making bolder proposals than the Commission where the recycling of waste is concerned. However, what can we expect from a Commission whose policy is to systematically sacrifice the general interest of Europeans for the sake of the individual interests of the shareholders of multinational companies? Environmental dumping of waste must be combated within and outside the Union. This matter should, moreover, constitute one of the core aspects of Mr Mandelson's negotiating mandate at the WTO. What is at stake here is not only the protection of the planet, but also the fight against relocations that are due to the violation of basic environmental rules. All waste produced within the Union, including waste from ships chartered by European companies, must be treated on EU soil by industrial sectors that create jobs, with national authorities assuming responsibility for this. Africa, India and Asia must no longer be treated as the dustbins of Europe. Local authorities have been able to anticipate, to set an example and to innovate. Proof of this is the ‘model’ methanisation plant and the multi-sector waste recovery process established by the authority to which my town belongs. Unfortunately, these exemplary achievements within the Union owe everything to local taxpayers and little or nothing to the Union and to manufacturers. It would be helpful for this to be taken into consideration and for help to be given to those who have fewer opportunities than others.

 Madam President, in our experience, liberalisation of the energy sector has always resulted in higher prices and worse service. Within the EU, liberalisation and the separation of energy producers and distributors have resulted in under-investment in production plants and electricity transport networks. It is this policy that was responsible for the blackouts in November 2006, and it will inevitably result in huge problems in the coming years. Under these circumstances, we must as a matter of urgency accelerate investment in research in all fields, including nuclear technology, so that we can meet the challenges of the post-oil era and combat greenhouse gases. It is imperative that we end the requirement for separation of energy producers and energy transport networks and that we halt all further attempts to liberalise the energy sector. That is why I would advocate creating a European energy agency to coordinate the Member States' energy policies and their efforts in terms of research and development. This body would head an economic interest group at EU level, which would involve all electricity production and distribution companies and would ensure access for all to reasonably priced energy. Energy is not a commodity like any other: it is a common asset for humanity.

Mr President, every passing day sees the automotive industry shed hundreds of jobs. The multinationals are putting enormous pressure on their workers. They presume to use the workforce as scapegoats, challenging their acquired rights and almost implying that they are wallowing in affluence. The fact is that workers have never been more productive or less secure in their jobs at any time in the last fifty years. Not for thirty years has their purchasing power been so low. It is not the competitiveness of labour that is putting the car industry in trouble but movements of capital in search of maximum yields in the shortest possible time. Car-manufacturing groups engage in blackmail to milk the areas where their plants are located, and once they have sucked local budgets dry they start to look for pastures new where the grass is greener. It is high time this Parliament stopped confining itself to hollow rhetoric and took tough initiatives to defend Europe's industrial potential, to hit profiteers where their heart lies, namely in their wallets, and to guarantee employees the right to genuine job security and training. These are some of the aims underlying the charter that my group is advocating as the key to the defence and development of our automotive industry.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since we are discussing the European Central Bank’s report, allow me to address these few words to its president. Mr Trichet, you really are the reviver of a very poor system for all the peoples of Europe. As such, you have probably been – inadvertently, otherwise it would have been common knowledge – the best campaigner for the ‘no’ vote of the French and Dutch people on the European Constitutional Treaty, and we thank you for it. The principles on which the European Central Bank is founded are already in themselves an obstacle to growth in the euro zone, but when there is growth, in spite of your actions, it creates few or no jobs and only benefits the richest in society. The European Central Bank claims to have stopped inflation. In reality, the working and middle classes have seen their purchasing power plummet, while the rich have never been so rich. You champion the worst kind of capitalism, that of shareholders and the pauperisation of the middle and working classes. Day after day, your inertia faced with the weak dollar policy pursued by the United States destroys thousands of qualified industrial jobs creating added value in the euro zone. You represent the bank of discontent and mass unemployment. For all these reasons, we must break with a European Central Bank controlled by the financial markets and with no link to the will of the peoples of the Union. We urgently need a new treaty entrusting the European Central Bank with responsibilities in the field of employment, training and research, all under the strict control of our Parliament and the national parliaments. This new treaty must, imperatively, replace the financial stability pact with a social progress pact for employment and growth, reviving public spending throughout the Union on health, training, education, social housing, culture, transport and infrastructure. Through these decisions we will be able to restore the confidence of the European people. If this were not the case, the gap would continue to widen between our institutions and the various peoples. The differences in wealth between the peoples of the Union and between citizens of a single country would continue to increase. This would therefore encourage the rise of extremism and anti-European nationalism.

Mr President, Airbus’s strategic and industrial decisions decide not only the fate of tens of thousands of employees but also the future of a large part of the European aeronautical industry. It is vital that respect be shown for the knowledge, work, and investment of Airbus’s employees and subcontractors via efforts to prevent a situation in which they are reduced to nothing. Airbus’s employees should under no circumstances be made to pay for the mistakes and the errors made by the managers and shareholders. Through the knowledge that they bring, these employees represent the true jewel in Airbus’s crown. Airbus is failing because of the liberal policies that have been implemented, and, if it is to get back on track, a return to public ownership and funding of EADS at European level is required. I am also pleased to note that, in both Germany and Spain, many people are speaking out in an effort to see the employees granted genuine powers to intervene in the management of Airbus. Let Mr Mandelson do his job so that the Americans no longer challenge the system of repayable advances and so that the European Central Bank and the Commission intervene at last to counter the weak dollar.

Madam President, allow me to congratulate my colleague, Mr Guerreiro, on his report, which is remarkable and very thorough. Let us be clear. Fishing in general, and small-scale fishing in particular, are, in Europe, in danger of dying out. If nothing is done, there will no longer be any small-scale fishermen in 15 years’ time within the territory of the European Union. If there are no longer any small-scale fishermen, then all of the tourist and economic activity from sales by auction and specialist catering will also disappear. Without the presence of those who are, first and foremost, sea lovers, the odds are that the Member States’ territorial waters will be abandoned, in that case, to the atrocities of the hooligans of the sea, who fear neither God nor man. How can one fail to understand the desire of some people to see fishing disappear when it is clear that the disappearance of certain fishing ports could offer new prospects of developing the pleasure-boat market, something that would not leave the particularly influential economic and financial interests indifferent? In order to support my argument and to prove that the aim is indeed one of putting paid to fishing, I invite you to refer to the scandalous and criminal decision taken by the Commission, which, on the pretext of a distortion of competition and at the very time when the price of diesel fuel has not stopped rising, has put an end, in France, to the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing, with the result that the entire profession has been put in a very difficult position. As the report recommends, this fund for the prevention of risks to fishing should have been extended to the entire Union, not banned by the Commission. It also seems necessary to me to demand central buying offices for supermarkets, with the prices taking account of the real costs incurred by small-scale fishermen. To conclude, I believe that, if we are to reverse the trend and save European fishing, it is important for us to adopt this report and, above all, for the Commission very swiftly to implement the proposals it contains.

 Mr President, if we think that access to safe and cheap energy is an inalienable right and if we want everyone to be able to consume the energy necessary to his or her development, we cannot but concur with the objectives stated in the report by our fellow MEP, Mr Buzek. We must give our full backing to ITER and to nuclear fusion. It is a solution for the future that will guarantee the independence of our energy supply, access for all to electricity and the development of skilled jobs in industry. Let us at the same time acknowledge that alternative sources of energy will not allow us to respond to demand and that fossil-based sources of energy just make pollution worse. Faced with this reality, I am, however, surprised that it is being proposed to us that we reduce the funds allocated to Euratom. We should, emphatically, be doing the opposite. Moreover, only public control, as distinct from the single energy market, will enable us in complete safety to achieve the objectives set by Euratom. If France has one of the least expensive energy supplies and is a developed nation, this is because of nuclear power and because the production and distribution of electricity has been a public monopoly.

 Mr President, faced with risks to safety and the environment, with the practices of a sector that too often treats its employees as modern-day slaves, and with the expected major increase in traffic flows, the Commission seems to be realising that the problem is a serious one and that something needs to be done about it. Free and fair competition is leading us into disaster. We have before us a proposal to develop the motorways of the sea, rail and intermodality and to help industrial and non-industrial SMEs. In parallel to this, however, the Commission is continuing its crusade to privatise the railways, without even reviewing ten disastrous years. This direction is the right one to take, but there are not enough resources to make it credible. That is why my group is calling for a separate vote on Mr Rack's report and on the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. We will be voting against this opinion, because it can be summed up as 'tell me what you are missing, and I will tell you how to do without it'.

Mr President, that did not happen in Europe, but it could have done. Not only have we failed to learn any lessons from the power cuts in California in 2000, but you are creating conditions that will result in Europe also experiencing a large-scale energy disaster. Your proposals will result in a more expensive and less reliable energy supply. Separating the transport network from electrical energy production units is an economic, ecological and industrial aberration. Once again, the European institutions are taking the side of financial interests to the detriment of the general interest. The capitalist market is incapable of making long-term investments in the energy sector. Satisfying shareholders’ interests means sacrificing research, sustainable development and security. The decision to artificially create a large internal energy market will also lead to a large number of jobs being axed and many others being put in jeopardy. Our Union needs a strong European public arm, funded by the public in order to fulfil the needs of Europeans.

Mr President, under the pressure of the French and Dutch ‘No’ votes on the Constitution, Parliament is finally concerning itself with relocations. I can only approve of the measures proposed. There is an urgent need to implement these measures because each day that goes by brings with it the destruction of thousands of jobs. I regret that, in this area, we have only got as far as providing support in small doses, when what is required is a drastic remedy. Nevertheless, the relatively tentative approach of the report illustrates the major contradiction running through the Union’s economic policy: competition can never be both totally free and undistorted. Businesses use blackmail, threatening to relocate in order to force employees to accept social conditions that fall short of what is required by their countries’ laws. This social blackmail is coupled with fiscal blackmail. The threat of relocations is systematically used to obtain tax relief. Successfully combating relocations entails the swift, upwards harmonisation of taxation and social laws within Europe. Furthermore, we have to put an end to the independence of the European Central Bank, which always promotes the interests of public borrowings to the detriment of those of the job market.

Everything comes down to two figures: today, in the Union, services represent 70% of added value but they only amount to 20% of the exchanges carried out within the Community. Therefore, given the impossibility of relocating the majority of service companies, the abysmal wages are relocated instead and, to this end, the Bolkestein Directive was invented. Its aim: to reduce wages to the bare minimum, to level down social protections, to limit consumer rights and to dismantle public services. This is not even ultraliberalism any more; this is outright liberalism. Far from settling the problem of the country of origin principle and far from protecting public services from the merciless law of the market, the compromise between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament does nothing other than place the Commission and the Court of Justice in the role of final arbiter. Given the ultraliberal stance of the Commission and the Court of Justice, allowing them to assume such a role is like putting foxes in charge of a henhouse. To accept the Services Directive would amount to signing the death warrant, in Europe, of employee and consumer protection and of public services. The nations of Europe do not need a directive that takes the social and fiscal policy choices they made on a democratic basis and pits them against one another.

Mr President, we are finally making progress – at an absolute snail’s pace, but we are making progress. If there is one area in which social and fiscal dumping wreaks havoc and in which it is imperative that the legislator steps in, it is road transport. With employees forced to work at a furious pace due to the just-in-time phenomenon, one can rightly talk about a wage of fear. A wage of fear that is all too often an hourly starvation wage, one that compels people to calculate driving times on the basis of distances travelled, without giving a single thought to safety or their health or that of others. I am also thinking of the small businessmen in this sector who live in daily fear of going bankrupt, victims of the criminal dogma of free and undistorted competition, who are very far removed today from the ideals that first led them to become self-employed. There is only one law, that of transporting a commodity from one point to another, as quickly and as cheaply as possible. The risks do not matter; after all, there is insurance. This law has a name: the law of the jungle. It is high time we acted so that our roads are no longer like the Wild West. Despite the courageous and tenacious efforts of our fellow Member, Mr Markov, I regret the timidity of the final texts. Nevertheless, they do constitute a first step in the right direction. Some of our fellow Members rant on about big-brother-style surveillance when the use of electronic techniques for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the regulation is mentioned. They call this an attack on individual freedoms. However, it is a question here of protecting lives. Cannot they see that it is the big bosses of European businesses that are the main terrorists, the ones that breach social laws and encourage fiscal and social dumping among our nations, those employers who are directly responsible, on a daily basis, for dozens of fatal accidents on our roads? So yes, let us use all the resources available to us in order to guarantee safety and to enable the European Union to live peacefully.

Mr President, the port services directive presented to us for the second time completely overlooks the general interest and the improvement of the living conditions of Europeans. What is worse, it only serves the financial interests of the large transnational freight companies, to the detriment of all the actors in the port sector, from the port worker to the small businessman. Its only aims are those of demolishing the statutes and social protection measures and dragging salaries down in order to make a minority rich, and this to the detriment of people’s safety and the environment. This directive’s social model is as good as the law of the jungle; self-handling is slavery reborn. All the technical-nautical professions and all the European trade unions unanimously reject this Bolkestein-style directive for the ports. Yesterday, I joined the 10 000 port workers from all over Europe in demonstrating before Parliament. I can bear witness to their determination to stand in the way of this monstrous directive. I can assure you that voting in favour of a directive such as this means taking responsibility for many of the Union’s ports being blocked by hard-line strikes, with all the economic consequences that such action entails. I, like others, would point out to the Commission that we, as the representatives of the nations of Europe, had already rejected this directive. To propose another, almost identical, version of it constitutes a political affront to Parliament and to the port authorities as a whole. For the sake of the construction of another Europe seeking a high level of social and democratic integration, we call for this directive to be rejected.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fishing – just like agriculture – is not an economic sector like any other. Fishing contributes to improving quality of life at European level and to protecting the coastline and the environment. In many cases, small-scale fishing even helps to bolster tourism. It is worth emphasising that the fishing community plays an important role. The job they do with such passion is demanding, tough and dangerous and their income is dependent on too many uncertainties. Often in debt, and subject to the continually rising price of diesel, fishermen and their families live with the fear of not being able to make ends meet and of losing their jobs. Throughout its existence, the common fisheries policy has failed to relieve their fears. On the contrary, it has contributed to the loss of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs and to the social insecurity of fishermen, without achieving convincing results with respect to the conservation of resources. What is worse, this policy has often given the impression of being subject to the law of the lobbies, who are more interested in cultivating their media images and in chasing subsidies than in making a serious effort to protect the environment. That, Commissioner, is why fishermen are fed up with continually being suspected of being the criminals of the sea, by a European Commission that, in contrast, is far too lenient on the real pirates of the sea, by which I mean flags of convenience. Commissioner, contrary to the prejudices of your learned assembly of scientists, nobody is more committed to conserving fishery resources than fishermen. It is their livelihood, their heritage and the future of their children. They have had more than enough of a situation in which quotas for fishing days and catch sizes, often laid down without a real scientific basis and traded any old how between the States, are involved in establishing fishing zones. The Commission must not continue to favour fishermen of one nationality over those of another. Everyone must be on an equal footing within Europe. It is true that your text represents a certain amount of progress in the field, in setting as one of its formal objectives the involvement of all stakeholders, but you will forgive me for describing it as vague and timid. We cannot save fishing and fishery resources without the fishermen and their professional associations and trade unions. Fishermen, through their representatives, must be truly involved in all decisions affecting them. The Union must also provide financial aid to the Member States to help them protect their territorial waters against illegal fishing. I am thinking in particular of the territorial waters of the outermost regions of the EU. Insofar as there is a real problem of funding a fair, sustainable and bold European fisheries policy, we must not forget that one of the threats to resources comes from pollution caused by maritime transport. The system of flags of convenience is behind this pollution. If, therefore, we can point the finger at those responsible for this ongoing ecological disaster, we will be in a position to launch a really ambitious policy.

Mr President, talking is all very well, but action is better. Oil prices, combating pollution, road safety, working conditions for drivers, the deterioration of infrastructures due to lorries: these are all reasons why the development of rail freight must be treated as an absolute priority, but please allow me to be concerned and impatient because, where we should be acting firmly and quickly, at the moment the European Union is being weak and feeble! It must be noted that the trans-European rail infrastructure projects are progressing at a snail’s pace. Furthermore, I am alarmed by Mr Barrot’s participation, on 12 July, in a meeting of the lobby of road transport employers, within the context of a review of the White Paper on transport, neglecting rail in favour of roads. Mr Barrot should have stated that he would be more vigilant with regard to the need for rail investment. There is therefore only one question on the agenda: is there really the will to promote a determined policy of developing rail freight in Europe? That is the only question that matters.

 Mr President, there is none so deaf as he who will not hear. This is a proverb that applies very well to the Commission and to Commissioner Mandelson. At a time when the textile sector is experiencing a true industrial and social disaster, they were listening, but they were not hearing. In the matter that put us in opposition to China, the European Union threw in the towel by agreeing to reassess the import quotas. The proposals and calls for help from employees’ unions and professional associations in the sector went unheeded. The only winners in this affair are the dealers that fear neither God nor man, the saboteurs of European industry, masters of delocalisation at all costs. Demonstrating quite extraordinary courage, the Commission and the Commissioner jointly decided that, faced with hundreds of thousands of job losses, faced with the closure of thousands of businesses, they urgently needed to do nothing. They therefore hid behind this schoolyard phrase ‘20 million Chinese or Indian shirts equals one Airbus’. This equation is particularly stupid, because even an absolute imbecile knows that it is not the textile producers who buy Airbuses but the airlines. I can even tell you a secret: when these companies buy aeroplanes, it is because they need them, and they expect to fund these purchases from their activities, not by selling shirts. Moreover, the United States was able to sell its Boeings at the same time as taking the necessary measures to protect its textile industry. Faced with these pressures, with the anger of European workers and, above all, with the approach of the French referendum on the Constitution, you very strategically pulled out some tempting proposals, which were immediately received enthusiastically by all your friends in the club of two-faced hypocrites but which very quickly turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors. As you declared so cynically, globalisation is a game in which there are winners and losers, but we cannot say that to the people, so we are sometimes required to take tactical measures. In order to defend the interests of employees in the textile industry ... (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, since 1 January, hundreds of textile workers have found themselves thrown onto the streets, and tens of SMEs/SMIs have disappeared together with their know-how. It is hard to say, but it is not the trousers and T-shirts imported from China that should be counted, but the jobs destroyed and the lives shattered. When we hear the Commission and the Council of Ministers say, ‘we are not aware, we were not aware, we could not be aware, it is China’s fault’, I can only cry out: but who are they trying to kid? The decision to abolish the quotas was taken 10 years’ ago with the agreement of all of the governments. China has been part of the WTO for nearly four years. Over the past two years, nine out of ten textile machines have been bought by China. Ultra-modern factories have been built there thanks to direct or indirect capital investments, including from Europe. The European governments and institutions knew all of that and have done little or nothing at all. They are therefore entirely and jointly responsible. The pitiful agreement that Commissioner Mandelson reached with the Beijing authorities will not change anything. The ineffable Commissioner Mandelson is like Molière’s doctor: he waits for his patient to die in order to ascertain his illness. However, can the general interests of Europe be reconciled with the specific interests of the City: invest in China, Turkey or elsewhere? Today it is the textile industry, but tomorrow it will be the car industry or perhaps the aeronautics industry, as China already manufactures Airbus doors and builds regional aircraft that compete with European, Canadian or Brazilian products. You were surprised by the instinctive rejection of your ultraliberal constitution by the majority of those rare people in Europe who had a vote! This overwhelming rejection is, however, the people’s punishment for your policy, including that relating to the textile industry. The public do not want that policy to become the basic law of the Union. In order to save and develop our textile industry, it is time for a change of policy. After introducing a moratorium on the lifting of quotas, the Commission is duty bound to boost and assist research and development and training efforts in this sector. The European Central Bank ought to encourage the introduction of low-interest loans for SMEs/SMIs in the sector, promoting employment, research and training. The Union should take measures to prevent imports of goods produced by children or slave labour or by workers denied their freedom to participate in trade union activity, and to impose a tax on social dumping. Finally, emerging countries should be given assistance to develop their internal markets.

 Mr President, how can we fail to respect these men and women who, fleeing poverty or dictatorship or war, are prepared to sacrifice everything to reach the European Union in the legitimate hope of a better life? Zero immigration and fortress Europe are dangerous and reprehensible utopias. Saying this, though, does not mean that we can just do anything. The acceptance of immigrants needs to be organised and prepared. In this matter, the EU must play its role, including by providing funding. I share the report’s hostility to the setting up of detention centres and to sifting immigrants within the EU or outside its borders. I experienced this, sadly, with the notorious camp at Sangatte. These centres do not solve anything, quite the contrary. They feed tensions of all kinds. I agree with the report where it puts forward as a principal aim decisively and mercilessly attacking the people smugglers. The same pitiless suppression must be targeted at employers who exploit immigrants completely outside the law. On the other hand, I regret the fact that the report presents EU immigration policy as an adjustment variable for the labour market and as a way of pushing down wages. Good immigration policy involves a real will to support the sustainable development of emerging countries and not cynically viewing them as a democratic source of cheap labour for the needs of the European Union.

Madam President, I was expecting to find in this directive what is missing from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the draft European Constitution: the upwards harmonisation of social rights. There is no mention of it. The opposite is true, in fact. Only employees’ flexibility has been increased therein. Whilst the hanged men of Chicago died in 1886 for an eight-hour working day and a 40-hour working week, here we have, at the beginning of the 21st century, the great social innovation of the European Union, which should seek to raise the ceiling on the maximum weekly working time from 48 hours to 65 hours, or indeed above that in the event of individual or collective agreements, with the reference period for calculating the maximum weekly working time increased from four to 12 months. Generously, periods of compensatory rest at the end of 72 hours’ work are guaranteed. One can only acknowledge the social audacity of this text that will most likely make European employers tremble! To cap it all, the concept of an inactive period of on-call time is being introduced, which is to be excluded from working time, and which completely contradicts the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. There is no need for further explanation. The zealous servants of European employers have toiled well and although they know, like those who will choose to vote in favour of this text … (The President cut off the speaker

Mr President, whilst I judge the general philosophy of this report positively, and whilst this text may be an acceptable foundation for upwards harmonisation of the rights of European citizens with regard to social protection linked to healthcare, it also presents some serious shortcomings. It remains too general, does not set any timetables, and is not sufficiently focused. Well, on this issue, incantations are not enough. Let us be ambitious for this social Europe every one of us wants to see, and let us take healthcare and social protection expenditure from the Stability and Growth Pact, as this expenditure does not represent costs; it is an investment that creates wealth and efficiency for society as a whole. Two significant matters absent from the report are the issue of financing a pioneering social protection system and mass unemployment in Europe. Both issues are of major importance. Without shared financing and without financial income contributions to the solidarity effort, it will be impossible to achieve the desired goal. With regard to unemployment, it is a long-lasting strain on the sum of revenues required to finance social protection and healthcare. By way of conclusion, let me add these two precise responses to the precise needs of the European people. In striving too hard to reach a limp consensus, which in the end leads to nothing, we are only intensifying Eurosceptism.

 Mr President, the issue of Alstom Power Boiler has left us all with our backs to the wall with respect to our commitment to create a Europe of full employment, with a strong high-tech industry, a Europe that cares about the environment, a Europe that is free from the technological and financial domination of the United States. What is this about? A subsidiary of the Alstom group, whose creative, research and production resources are established in Europe – 250 employees in France, in Vélizy, 300 in Germany, in Stuttgart, and a number of plants in the Czech Republic, Portugal and Poland – but whose headquarters are in the United States, in Connecticut. This company’s expertise is in the manufacture of boilers for generating steam and electricity. It is the world leader in the production of clean coal and is developing new technologies for CO2 capture. With the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the need to diversify energy sources, it is clear that such technologies have huge potential. However, for reasons that are unclear, the management of Alstom has decided to transfer the European expertise to the United States, to reduce the workforce in Vélizy by four fifths and to halve that in Stuttgart, probably with the aim of eventually closing the main European sites. The pretext for this siphoning-off of European expertise was a pseudo-study carried out – what a surprise – by the Americans, announcing that the market was expected to shrink by a third over the next four years. Following the example of the employees of Power Boiler, we cannot take this study seriously, especially when we know the enormous demand in this field that is emerging throughout the world. As they say in my country, though, when you want to kill your dog, you accuse it of having rabies. A lack of a real long-term industrial strategy, a frantic scramble for immediate profits, those have been the main characteristics of the Alstom Group since it was privatised. The Commission, and also the French Government, must also take some of the responsibility. Fortunately, the employees at the European sites affected, supported by their trade unions, have not thrown in the towel. The employees in Vélizy, in particular, have come up with a counterplan based around withdrawing the company from the Alstom group for a sales price in the region of one symbolic euro, creating a European public limited-liability company grouping together the Vélizy and Stuttgart sites and retaining the plants in the Czech Republic, Poland and Portugal. This plan is based on the voluntary participation of the employees. It has the advantage of fitting in with the demands of 7 July 2004 drawn up by the European Commission with regard to Alstom on the subject of the disposal of assets, the aim being to safeguard and increase employment and European technological potential compared to the United States. This cooperation between European employees is at the forefront of the application of European law, as it will result in the creation of a European public limited-liability company. We must work fast, though, as the company’s intellectual property is on the way to being transferred to the United States and Switzerland and Alstom’s general management is working to put the company in financial difficulties. If, ladies and gentlemen, we are committed to the growth of industry and employment, we must do all we can to support this initiative. It is true that the directive on European public limited-liability companies and the regulation on the involvement of employees in corporate governance have not yet been transposed into French law, but it is always possible to look ahead. It is a question of political will and I expect the Commission to show this will. So, let us not disappoint these workers, whose jobs are threatened but who are so proud of their unparalleled technical achievements and are always ready to innovate.

 Mr President, it is true that short sea shipping needs to be developed in the European Union, in the same way as road-rail transport. We need to be able to transport all the goods necessary for the functioning of our economies all over Europe, while at the same time keeping our fellow citizens as safe as possible and continually ensuring that we protect our environment. Why? Because it is quite obvious that lorries are continuing to build up in bottlenecks, leading to all sorts of unpleasantness showing us human exploitation in all its glory. Many of the vessels currently engaged in cabotage are rusting hulks skimming our coasts, often only just avoiding causing real ecological disasters because of their condition. That is why only public action at European level, including direct industrial and economic intervention, will be able to resolve the situation. The development of short sea shipping cannot be seen as a strategic regional planning choice. The growth in short sea shipping needs to be considered, not in competition with the necessary investment in rail freight and road-rail transport, but in synergy with it. I stress that, in maritime affairs, safety and respect for the environment must be of primary importance, with competition being secondary. The administrative procedures regarding cabotage can and must be improved, but certainly not to the point of throwing everything overboard simply on the pretext of saving time. We must retain all the monitoring methods in order to combat trafficking of all kinds. In conclusion, I believe that short sea shipping has a great future ahead of it in Europe, if it is run by seamen and states and not by large concerns that are only interested in pure profit, regardless of the economic, social and human cost.

 Mr President, for the sake of some vague compromise with the WTO, we are getting ready to throw tens of thousands of workers onto the street, to close down dozens of undertakings, to deal a terrible blow to European agriculture, and to call into question the development of many countries. Yet who will profit from this reform? Will it be the farmers? Who could possibly believe such a stupid idea, when the gross loss of income is announced as being 50%? Perhaps it will be the consumers? That is really hard to believe, because a fall in the producer prices paid to farmers has never had any effect on the purchasing power of households. How about small producers in the Southern hemisphere? Our experience of the coffee market and of sugar production in Brazil is hardly going to convince us. On the other hand, the multinationals in the agri-food industry have cause for celebration. Thanks to the Commission and the WTO, they will be able to force more young children to work on the sugar-cane plantations. They will be able to exploit a little more the suffering men and women who are often paid less than 100 dollars a month. They will be able to watch their profits swell enormously on the basis of a social disaster. This reform is also giving rise to terrible anxiety throughout the most remote regions. Our group recently visited Réunion, at the invitation of Mr Verges, and we were able to see for ourselves the extent to which this reform was a catastrophe for that island. In addition to the need for total compensation, a problem of consistency has also arisen. Despite the fact that, for over 40 years, the greater part of the European Union’s investments have been devoted to the development of the cane-sugar sector, and the fact that that sector represents one third of final agricultural production, 25% of electric production and three quarters of exports, it is now proposed to call into question the very existence of this strategic development action, without there being any possibility of an alternative which could cope with the consequences. We must understand the full scope of the consequences of this reform. At the request of Mr Verges, our group would like the Commission to undertake to submit to Parliament a study of the impact, particularly the social impact, on the real situation of the outlying regions. We would also like the same type of study to be carried out on a European scale. Mr President, let me finish by saying that we are convinced that there are solutions to be found within a real policy on the regulation of the sugar market, of which Europe should be the promoter.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course in favour of doubling the EU budgetary resources allocated to research. When you realise that public and private research and development expenditure in the EU amounts to only 1.95% of GDP compared with 2.64% in the United States and 2.98% in Japan, you can see how much the famous Lisbon strategy and the Commission have failed. That is why I believe that if the European Union is to have an effective research policy, we must not only double the appropriations for research but also review and radically question the methods and objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development implemented by the European Commission and the Council. Indeed, contrary to the philosophy of the Seventh Framework Programme, a successful research and development system can only be based on cooperation and exchange between public and private researchers and laboratories and not on all out competition and shortage of money. What I fear the most is that resources will be concentrated in a small number of priority areas of research, which are bound to be those most likely to bring immediate profits for the large industrial groups, at the expense of fundamental physics and the human and social sciences; that would mean researcher recruitment and careers would probably no longer be based on scientific assessment but on priorities directly dictated by the interests of the multinationals involved in the framework programme’s activities. For my part, I, of course, believe that research expenditure must be taken out of the Stability Pact calculation, but that is not enough. It is even more important that questions of research in Europe should no longer be decided by the Commission alone, but by elected representatives of the scientific community. I therefore propose the creation of a representative assembly of all researchers at the European Parliament. That assembly would have such important tasks as ethical appraisal, the drafting of recommendations, encouraging cooperation, monitoring and continuity of the funding granted, and ensuring that the regions are not forced to compete with each other. That is the only way in which the European Union will be able to look to the future with greater optimism.

 Madam President, allow me to express to this House my heartfelt solidarity with the millions of employees who will see their lives shattered in the interests of satisfying, once again, a minority of affluent people. Indeed, the economists of the International Federation of Trade Unions talk of what they, if not the Commission, know will be the destruction of thirty million jobs, a million of them in Europe, North Africa, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. As if what a number of these countries have just experienced were not enough, they now find themselves in even deeper trouble. It is, I strongly emphasise, the Commission’s, the Council’s and Parliament’s responsibility and duty to put a stop to this social disaster.

Mr President, over these past few years, thousands of people – men, women and children – have passed through my home town of Calais, or through the notorious Sangatte camp, having been persuaded that they will find their El Dorado in the United Kingdom: Kosovars, Afghans, Iraqis, Sudanese, Kurds – people in search of freedom and security, simple citizens of the world, driven by misery to take to the road, wishing only, like every one of us, for a bit of happiness. Allow me to assure them of our solidarity. While I endorse most of the content of the Lambert report, I am duty-bound to state to this House the objective fact that, while improving, simplifying and standardising application procedures for asylum seekers is a definite step forward, as long as we spare ourselves the trouble of conducting a real comprehensive debate on the type of immigration Europe needs and on the economic development policy it must pursue towards poor countries, we shall achieve nothing, and this forum of ours will be the scene of regular debates on the plight of these latter-day nomads. Europeans must know that there is a better standard of living here than in Africa and, in particular, that it is possible for people to work here illegally if they are prepared to earn less and keep quiet. In Europe, there are those who attract, exploit and get rich by engaging in this slave trade. Yes, we need to restore the honour of Europe, which is all too often sullied, just as we must urge the Union to stop burying its head in the sand on the pretext that talking about immigration fuels nationalist sentiments. Europe, however, must not be the sole focus of our attention in this respect. The IMF, whose recommendations are often responsible for mass emigrations, the United Nations and the office of its High Commissioner for Refugees also have a part to play. Yes, the European Union should have an asylum policy that accords with the principles of the European Human Rights Convention. Yes, the European Union should examine the emigration issue in depth. Yes, the European Union should remember that some of the children within its own territory are stricken by hunger too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to arm or to develop, that is the question. We estimate that arms imports in fact account for over 20% of the developing countries’ debt. In those countries, military spending often far exceeds the health budget or the education budget, and sometimes it even exceeds both put together. It is therefore crucial to these countries’ sustainable development that they significantly stem the flow of arms imports. It is not possible to live for very long in a world in which USD 900 billion goes on military spending, whereas only USD 325 billion is spent on agricultural subsidies and only USD 60 billion is set aside for development aid. Against this backdrop, to take just one example, between 1995 and 2001 in Sub-Saharan Africa, military spending rose by 47% and life expectancy fell by four years. Yes, the European Union’s Code of Conduct on arms exports has existed since 1998. Yes, EU countries have made progress. As a matter of urgency, however, we must go further, especially given that other powers, such as the United States, Russia and China, do not practise such self-restraint. I feel that the measures laid down by Parliament’s Committee on International Trade will indeed make it possible for us to go further, even if they fall short of what some of us had hoped for. It is essential that these measures be adopted because they will help us to establish a different mindset. I should like to give particular mention to the complete harmonisation of the policy on Member States’ arms exports in the medium term, helping arms manufacturers to change direction and diversify into other products in order to prevent social crises and the loss of skills, the creation of a European agency for the control of arms exports and, most importantly, the creation of a tax on arms exports that will benefit the victims of conflict and the fight against poverty. Consequently, if the EU adopted those proposals and turned them into practical legal measures, that would represent considerable progress and would provide the impetus for putting pressure on countries such as the United States, China, Ukraine, Russia and Israel. What would be even more effective would be if all of this could lead to measures aimed at controlling the origin of capital in tax havens set up in EU territory. By doing that, we would be taking a step towards saving the human race. I should like to conclude, if I may, by quoting Albert Einstein: ‘Either the human race will destroy arms, or arms will destroy the human race’.

 Madam President, the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar is giving rise to grave concern both in the ACP countries and in the outermost regions. That concern is particularly keen on the island of Réunion, where sugar cane is still the main crop. The mobilisation of the players in the sugar-cane sector has not been in vain. It has brought appreciable changes to the initial reform plan. We note these positive changes and pay tribute to the work done by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur. We must not deceive ourselves, however. The measures proposed to mitigate the effects of this reform are temporary and as such merely palliatives designed solely to win acceptance for a reform the effects of which may ultimately be disastrous. The outermost regions share the same fate as the ACP countries in this respect. We cannot let them believe their future is assured. It is all the less secure because there are many uncertainties about what will happen after 2013. Apart from the inadequate Community compensation, what national compensation will there be and, more importantly, will it continue beyond 2013? This concern is all the more legitimate because the Hong Kong summit suggested there will be a new debate starting in 2009 with implications for the European budget, including the common agricultural policy. When we know that a stock of sugar cane represents seven years’ harvest on average, after which it must be replanted, it is easy to see that these uncertainties may undermine the confidence required to meet the replanting targets hitherto supported by the European Union. Ultimately, the question is how the sugar cane sector can be saved. Madam President, I will conclude by saying that, faced with this situation where our planters’ future is not assured beyond the life of a cane stock, it will be impossible for us to approve the report that is before us.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Development, I should like to begin by congratulating our fellow Member, Mr Wijkman, on his excellent report on climate change. As draftsman of this committee, I should like to make a few brief remarks of a general nature. Our fellow Member is right to emphasise that, although global warming represents an environmental challenge, it is above all a challenge for development. In actual fact, climate change is, in our opinion, a real concern for civilisation. That is why our committee was keen to highlight that the combined effects of climate change, of worldwide demographic changes and of economic globalisation open the doors to an unprecedented period of instability in the history of humankind. There are indeed grounds for fearing that, in this context, global warming will increase the divide between the developed world and countries whose development is lagging behind. There is, unfortunately, no doubt that these countries will be affected most by the impacts of climate change. This is particularly the case as regards the small island states, which are vulnerable in more ways than one, above all in the face of hurricanes and of rising sea levels. That is why we believe that providing aid to enable these countries to adapt in the face of the impacts of climate change must be one of the priorities of the European Union’s development aid policy. We recommend that the European Union develop a specific cooperation policy for developing countries. You will have realised that, as far as the Committee on Development is concerned, the fight against climate change is therefore irrevocably tied to the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The report is also right to emphasise the mitigation efforts that still need to be made in order to achieve the Kyoto Protocol’s objectives. Just one question to conclude, Madam President: while, today, 20% of the planet’s population consumes 80% of the world’s energy, how polluted will the atmosphere be in around 2050 at a time when the energy requirements of between nine and ten billion people will have to be met?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Marques’s report once again bears witness to the attention that the European Parliament pays to the outermost regions. Indeed, the Ligios report on the French overseas departments, back in the second parliamentary term, laid the initial foundations for the concept of the outermost regions, a report that inspired programmes already intended to compensate for remoteness and insularity. During the current period of uncertainty about what will happen after 2006, Parliament’s support for the outermost regions is very valuable. Sérgio Marques’s report is very much to the point in this regard. Indeed, although the European Union’s support has made possible a number of achievements in our underdeveloped regions, there is still much to be done. That was also the conclusion of the 11th Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions, which took place on the island of Réunion at the beginning of this month, in your presence, Mrs Hübner. On that occasion, I advocated a reversal of approach to relations between the European Union and the outermost regions. Over and above what the European Union brings to these regions, we must recognise the worth of what they bring in terms of European added value. Let me remind you of some obvious examples. It is the outermost regions that put Community shipping in its position as world leader. The geographic situation of Kourou in Guiana makes a significant contribution to the competitiveness differential enjoyed by the European space industry. So, there is the ocean, space, and we could also cite the exceptional biodiversity of the outermost regions, their importance for improving knowledge of climatic phenomena and their contribution to cultural diversity. The great distance from the continent in which the outermost regions are integrated and the geographic proximity of other continents with which the European Union has agreements also sometimes give rise to contradictions. I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that this dual identity provides a real prospect for the sustainable codevelopment of these areas, all of which face major challenges. The EU’s ability to respond to the question of the development of its outermost regions will bear witness to its ability truly to be a decisive player in fair and controlled globalisation.

 Mr President, climate change presents the human race with a challenge to civilisation, because this is a question of maintaining the species and the major balances of nature. What is needed is a fresh perspective on our concept of progress and development. This problem will increasingly come to dominate people’s shared existence as this century progresses. The profusion of extreme climate phenomena confirms that the effects of global warming are already being felt. Profound changes are now inevitable. Whilst the EU appears determined to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, a great deal remains to be done, however, if we are to prepare our communities to face the changes that are already underway. A genuine adaptation policy must be drawn up and implemented, as a matter of the utmost priority. We must draw political conclusions from the work of scientists and, in particular, the European Environment Agency’s report, which sets out the various effects of global warming in Europe. Our continent, let us not forget, may be the smallest continent in the world, but it is also the continent with the most coastline. The 155 outlying coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean have already decided – on the initiative of the French National Observatory on the effects of global warming, of which I am the chairman – to meet in 2005, in Marseille, to debate this question of adaptation. We trust that we will have the Commission’s support on this measure, which can help to draw up a genuine European strategy for adapting to current climate change. This strand, which has become an integral part of the Community action programme on climate change, should now be extended.
